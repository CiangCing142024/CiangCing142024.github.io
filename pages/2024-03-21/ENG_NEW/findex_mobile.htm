<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-4adb1f3f1dbb76474ab0dd0350673a10">
  On Tuesday, March 5, the Supreme Reactionary Court of Bombaim acquitted the democratic professor DR G.N. Saibaba and five other accused of "connections with Maoism" in a case manufactured by the old Indian state to criminalize those who fight in defense of the rights of the people.
 </p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-b2e758a2404519b19a0f7aa151159e29">
  The exprofesor of the University of Delhi gave a collective interview after being released from the cell of the Nagpur central prison. He made complaints against the old Indian state:
 </p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-28d7623dc926fd910a86e2df44ad8931">
  “Another lawyer was imprisoned for supporting me. During the trial, some police threatened my lawyers "
 </p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-f915a34255af18465cf7706f22333989">
  In addition to that, Saibaba denounced the ill -treatment against prisoners:
 </p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-4bca79531d0a11a3239873a3cd1f1153">
  “I was imprisoned in a prison that has capacity for 1,500 prisoners, more than 3,000 people were housed in precarious conditions. There was not even a single ramp in prison for people like me, ”he said.
 </p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-24ac22af218b95be4158a8cfd8bd1bdb">
  Excited, the lawyer affirmed that “instead of going to the hospital, choose to talk to the press today because you would support me. My family faced stigmatization and was called a terrorist ... I am sitting in front of you today to talk with all of you with many pains in the body. I can't speak right nor am I in condition of sitting here ”, also denouncing the brutal treatment he suffered during the period that was imprisoned.
 </p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-578570a591f0d4f9b23c27eb63060711">
  The Indian reactionary justice failed to prove the involvement of Saibaba and the other five defendants, Mahesh Tarki, Pandu Pora Narot, Hem Keshwdatta Mishra, Prashant Rahi and Vijay. Nan Tarki. One of them, Narote, died in prison in August 2022.
 </p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-1a7aabfb0e735f73e4d797c0db673b4c">
  Saibaba had already been absolutely acquitted, in 2022, by the Court of Maharashtra, but the Supreme Court reversed the decision, stating that the professor was a "threat to national security."
 </p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-e628d661b27a4ac8ecbb908fd1c876d0">
  Inhuman and criminal treatment used against Saibaba in prison was the target of investigations of the United Nations Organization (UN). The professor suffers from paralysis as a result of polyomyelitis, as well as another 19 different health problems that were aggravated during the detention due to lack of medical assistance, part of a silent murder plan.

  Indian activists denounced the late decision of the Supreme Court, claiming that Saibaba's health situation may not be recovered. They denounced that the continuous arrest of other activists. Prison and repression against Saibaba and other Democrats in India is not an exclusivity of the Modi government, in fact, it is a common practice for the old Indian state.

  The persecution of the old Indian state against Saibaba is old, as well as its activism. The professor, president of the Revolutionary Democratic Front, defends Indian tribal peoples since the 1990s, denouncing the actions of repression forces and antipueblo and caste policies in the country. Between 2009 and 2012, Saibaba gathered Democrats around the forum against war to the people, in protest against the military operation "Green Hunt", application of the genocidal policy of the old Indian State against the Adivasi peoples (tribal peoples) and all the peasants from India, which mainly sought to attack the popular war directed by the Communist Party of India (Maoist), in addition to seizing natural wealth and delivering them to the great mining companies.
 </p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-526197b8e2e7d8e2338d3d2894f4c5f8">
  Even in 2012, after participating in various conferences in universities around the world, in which he denounced the war against the people promoted by the Indian repression forces and defended the revolution, the professor was threatened with dismissal from the university where he worked. At the time, public requests signed by several democratic personalities of India and the academic world came out in defense of Saibaba. In September 2013, despite that, the professor was imprisoned at his home and was torn from his wheelchair, accused of having committed a "robbery" in Maharashtra, being subsequently loose.
 </p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-3c18dc32a0daca0454946c7fd61d3209">
  In 2014, DR Saibaba was clandestinely seconded within the University of Delhi and as a result of this arbitrarily under the fascist "Law on the Prevention of Illegal Activities", after taking part in the campaigns to defense the rights of the people, being accused of connection with the Maoists. He was also active in the struggle for the liberation of Indian political prisoners and in the defense of the peasant struggle against the installation of multinationals in central and eastern India. Professors and activists at the University of Delhi denounced the isolation that was imposed on him, stating that the jailers did not give him the medications used since he suffered a cardiac arrest, a clear act of torture.
 </p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-783ef5362c2b4fc159aa8182975c82a4">
  In July 2015, the high court of Bombaim granted Saibaba three months of freedom through the payment of the bond after the followed complaints of the deterioration of its health in the prison. In the interview granted on that occasion, he questioned: “Why is the government afraid of me? Am I 90% paralyzed? This state thinks that a person who has the courage to approach, see and describe reality is a threat. ” The professor also continued in defense of the revolutionary struggle and condemning the old Indian state for the violence unleashed against the people, as well as denouncing the conditions of their prison and the violence suffered in their time in jail.
 </p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-7056ae06c5a71adb7a2fae06ee45c902">
  In December of the same year, the Supreme Court of Bombaim canceled the bail of the teacher, imprisoning him for Christmas. Under renewed attempts at silent murder, Saibaba denounced, in 2016, in a letter to the main judge of the district of Gadchiroli who was not receiving treatment for the serious wound on his left shoulder acquired in the prison and that this would aggravate the danger of losing the movement of his left hand. At the time, he asked the judge to be directed immediately for the treatment and required minimal facilities and assistants for daily tasks such as bathroom, use of the sanitary, displacement, food among other adaptations appropriate to their condition.
 </p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-8912d47978434052ab19308a726b3c90">
  On April 4, 2016, Saibaba was released on bail again, but was sentenced to life imprisonment in March 2017. In the letter written in prison to his wife, Saibaba claimed:
 </p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-a62fa6b4fcb986992151eb0f6624a610">
  “I don't have a blanket. I don't have a sweater or jacket. As the temperature decreases, unbearable and continuous pain in the legs and in the left hand increase. It is impossible for me to survive here during the winter that begins from November. I live here as an animal in its last sighs. ”
 </p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-3c9286b2d4b8ee36ed2b99198e0f55da">
  On December 17, 2018, as a way to continue his silent murder plan, the old Indian state also accused the doctors of Saibaba (Geriatra Dr. Haji Bhatti, the neurologist Dr. Prasad and the cardiologist Dr. Gopinath) to be "Sympathizers of Maoism" for witnessing the serious state of health in which the teacher was. On October 21, 2020, a hunger strike began to protest against its prison and the conditions in which it was maintained.
 </p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-f6201cff5020c8811383d314ac2fafe1">
  It was in 2022 that a first acquittal was granted to Saibaba, by the Superior Court of Mumbai. The Supreme Indian Court decided, last hour, to suspend the decision, which had occurred after a month of international campaigns in defense of freedom, the life and health of the teacher. The National Research Agency (ANI) of India denounced the Supreme Court that the accusation against the prisoner was "very serious" and that the procedural irregularities (such as the falsification of "evidence" by the authorities) were not sufficient for " justify acquittal. ” The protest of his students at the University of Delhi against the reactionary decision was harshly repressed.
 </p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-eddcfc9d9ad1e03bba3d442b001db094">
  Despite the long persecution and torture, the story of Saibaba is nothing but a history of resistance and continuous struggle in defense of the Indian people and the oppressed peoples in general. The democratic professor never hesitates in that defense, continuing from the prison and at the time he was released. Around the world, various campaigns were made over the years to denounce the arbitrary and criminal prison of Saibaba for the old state of India and the inhuman conditions in which the Democrat was maintained. In the poem written in the prison to his mother, the professor affirmed: "I had many friends / for the world, / more imprisoned in this prison / anaa Cell / I won many other friends / throughout the planet."
 </p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-5b5a4786139bc3807eaac11fd95c2dc0">
  The masses of the world and popular activists can celebrate the acquittal of Saibaba today, as well as its continuous struggle.

     Milei's policy punishes the people's team
    </strong>
</span>
</h3>
<p>
   According to a UNICEF study (United Nations Fund for Children), 7 out Indigence of 19.4% (more than 2 million 400 thousand).
  </p>
<p>
   Given this Milei reality, the budget for children, despite the fact that Law No. 26,061, in its article 72, prohibits reducing childhood, adolescence and family budgets.
  </p>
<p>
   February inflation was 13.2% and accumulates 276.2% in the last year.
  </p>
<p>
   The real salary lost 20.7% in the first 50 days of the Milei government, which insists on the restitution of the fourth category of salary tax, poorly called profits. In the draft sent to the governors, the taxable minimum would be equal to what a family needs so as not to fall into poverty in February. And would fall below in March.
  </p>
<p>
   In February a family needed $ 690,902 so as not to fall into poverty. The indigence line reached $ 322,851. With Milei's policy, one million people a month are new poor. Increased 57.4%, the highest data in 20 years.
  </p>
<p>
   Gas rates in AMBA would exceed 700%.
  </p>
<p>
   SMEs and small and medium -sized agrarian producers drag a production crisis, due to brutal inflation of their costs that restrict their profitability.
  </p>
<p>
   Faced with this, the "solution" of the government is: "the market is regulated alone" and we must not intervene. And opened the imports! of food products. This will leave prices and supply to foreign hands or the monopolies that concentrate national production. It will be the death of SMEs, which are 99.4% of the country's companies and use 64% of registered employees.
  </p>
<p>
   The strong temporal in recent days aggravated the situation of thousands of families in the AMBA and in several provinces. The national government makes silence and are thousands of evacuees who are without solutions.
  </p>
<p>
   José Luis Espert (President of the Budget and Finance Commission of the Chamber of Deputies) has the support of Milei to impose the salary tax, now it called that the rural tax is not paid in the province of Buenos Aires. He says he was "agrarian producer", when he is actually a landowner who defends the interests of the most reactionary sector of the ruling classes.
  </p>
<p>
   If you are so worried about taxes, you would have to get the VAT out of food to alleviate the hunger that deepens your policy and condemns all those who inhabit our soil.
  </p>
<p>
<strong>
    Milei's policy liquidates national production, punishing urban sectors and small and medium producers in the countryside.
   </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
    Faced with this policy, we call unity for fighting. Turning the arm to Milei's policy is a need for the great masses and is a great challenge.
   </strong>
</p>
<p>
   On that path, the March 12 days where there were facts such as the occupation of the municipality of Corrientes, the entrance to the Ministry of Social Development in Viedma (Rio Negro) and in the province of Chaco faced repression and 18 In March he continued with 500 route cuts throughout the country, and the accesses to CABA, where they repressed again at the Pueyrredón Bridge, Puente Saavedra and Liniers. This policy does not happen without repression.
  </p>
<p>
   "Hunger is the limit" was the slogan where the CCC, the UTEP and all unemployed and precarious organizations converged.

<strong>
     The political crisis is deepened
    </strong>
</span>
</h3>
<p>
   The popular struggles that led to the unemployment of January 24 created the conditions for the rejection in deputies of the Government's “Bus Law” project.
  </p>
<p>
   The advance of the struggles and the immense day of the 8M, starring thousands and thousands of women, who raised their voice to the shout of "Milei garbage you are the dictatorship" deepened the divisions above, as stated in the last central committee. This was expressed when 42 senators rejected the ominous December decretazo.
  </p>
<p>
   With this, Milei's attempt failed to prevent the treatment of DNU based on her meeting proposal in Córdoba on May 25. It was a hard blow to his second attempt to govern with all powers and public finances, burying the National Constitution.
  </p>
<p>
   Milei had to endure the "disobedience" of Villarruel, the vice president and president of the Senate, who visits and talks with Macri, the man who helped him for him to reach the presidency. Macri tries to regroup his strength and according to some, he prepares, if Milei collapses, to impose Villarruel as president.
  </p>
<p>
   Now, Milei, tries to "eat" votes to the PRO to gain territories, since he does not govern any province. A weakness in Argentina, which is a federal country, as they demonstrated with the claim of their funds, Chubut together with the other governors of Patagonia and other provinces.
  </p>
<p>
   The 70/23 DNU was rejected by 42 votes against 25 and 4 legislators abstained. The Senate result was not final, but it is a coup in politics and feels a precedent. Define the Chamber of Deputies, where fissures and fractures are seen in the political forces: many legislators have the pressure, that if they vote in favor of Milei they will collect it when they return to their provinces
   <strong>
    . We promote that multisectorals in the provinces make the deputies the popular repudiation of the decretazo
   </strong>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   The unity of the rejection of the Union DNU for the country, in block was key. Also the vote of Patagonian senators. The six Senators of Libertad advances showed their weakness. The Pro and Radicalism allies did not reach. The Civic Coalition and the president of the UCR, Lousteau voted against the DNU, which generated a stir in radicalism where more than a thousand leaders signed a document in their support.
  </p>
<p>
   Milei, furious against Congress, raised two alternatives: "The agreement or confrontation", while his apparatus in the networks ridiculed Villarruel. And the vice president replied: "Vote what they have to vote, you have to enforce Congress."
  </p>
<p>

     Milei and Caputo come for more punishment to the people
    </strong>
</span>
</h3>
<p>
   The IMF sent an urgent mission to Argentina in alarm: there is a "seriously" missing plan. Caputo tries to negotiate a new program with the Fund, with a new debt close to 15 billion dollars. I would be preparing a new devaluation, so they intend to leave the stocks.
  </p>
<p>
   This would deepen a program that has been sweeping with the industry, disagreeing the State and leaving thousands of state and private layoffs. He wants to open imports more, causing more inflation, more recession and more punishment for the people.
  </p>
<p>
   One step in that direction was the exchange of Caputo for 42.6 billion pesos (50.4 billion dollars) in local bonds for a longer term debt, in an attempt by the government to kick the debt forward and relieve the payment calendar , becoming the greatest internal refinancing in the history of the country.
  </p>
<p>
   Caputo reached around 77% of the debt with expiration until the end of the year, for new promissory notes, expiring between 2025 and 2028, according to a statement from the Ministry of Economy. The payments of the local debt of Argentina in 2024 are estimated at 57.5 billion pesos, 68,000 million dollars to the official change.
  </p>
<p>
   The changes of these bonds were mostly taken by state agencies such as the National Bank, Anses and others.
  </p>
<p>
   Caputo does the same thing he did when he was Minister of the Macri government, which led Argentina to the disaster we know.
  </p>
<p>
   Milei and Caputo know what they are doing. They know that debts with the IMF and the bonuses just redeemed are unpayable. The only thing they do is more debt with the IMF, more fattening from the pocket of the usurers and more punishment to the people.

  </p>
<p>
   The UTA made a 48 -hour strike on 12 and 13 in the provinces, rejecting salary proposals. Now they prepare a unemployment in the AMBA.
  </p>
<p>
   Aerolineas Argentinas pilots accuse Milei of freezing the salary discussion and will stop on 28 and 29/3, for 48 hours. "They have liquefied 83% of our purchasing power." And fight against the possible privatization of airlines.
  </p>
<p>
   With the conflict of acipendar in progress the UOM has just launched the continuity of its fighting plan in the steel branch with a 72 -hour strike that started 19. The steel entrepreneurs, with Paolo Rocca at the head, do not want to agree on increases in increases in In line with inflation. In truck drivers and other unions, the government refuses to homologate the increases achieved. It seems that the freedom that Milei proclaims runs for monopolies price increases, but not for free pearls, for that there is stocks.
  </p>
<p>
   More today, than with the appointment as Labor Secretary of Julio Cordero, a strong man of Techint and representative of the UIA in the Salary Council, an openly in favor of large companies is affirmed.
  </p>
<p>
   Teachers, non -teachers and university authorities specified a total strike in national universities against the budget cut by the libertarian government. Conadu Historical decided to deepen the fight plan.

     In a world in dispute, Milei advances with the delivery of sovereignty
    </strong>
</span>
</h3>
<p>
   While NATO military exercises follow in Europe, with 90 thousand troops and the objective of preventing a Russian attack, in this imperialist power, Putin achieved re -election for another 6 years, and said that, if NATO increases its military presence In Ukraine and goes to a direct confrontation with Russia, "the planet would be one step away from the third world war."
  </p>
<p>
   War preparations of the different powers increase. China increased more than 7% this year its military budget, and clashes with Taiwan and in the China Sea grow.
  </p>
<p>
   The dispute between the great powers is also expressed in our American continent, and in Argentina.
  </p>
<p>
   In a new sample of its delivery and alignment, the Government, via the General Administration of Ports (AGP), agreed to the intervention of the US Army Corps of Army in Hydrovia management in Paraná. This caused, among other things, the protest of the Government of Buenos Aires, claiming "the documentation that would have given rise to the memorandum."
  </p>
<p>
   An initiative similar to that of Milei was taken by the Paraguayan government and ran into the resistance of the opposition of that country. The provinces of the Norte Argentino described the movement as a violation of sovereignty.
  </p>
<p>
   On the other hand, the governor of Chubut, Ignacio Torres called to perform control tasks to a US patrol in the Argentine territorial sea.
  </p>
<p>
   The interference of foreign forces in Aguas Argentinas is part of the Milei delivery policy that leads us to be a tail van of the strategy of Yankee imperialism, the English pirates and the fascist government of Israel.
  </p>
<p>
   In turn, it does it illegally since it is not the faculty of the Executive Power, or of a province and, much less, of a third category distribution, such as the AGP authorizing the entry of foreign force, and must be authorized by Congress of the Nation, for the established of the National Constitution, according to article 75 and 99.
  </p>
<p>
   Another chapter of the imperialist dispute over our country was lived last week, with the announcement of the Chinese company Gezhouba, in charge of the construction of the dams in Santa Cruz, that it leaves the country, before the refusal of the Government of Milei of ratifying the contracts, with the consequent dismissal of 1,800 workers. According to
   <em>
    Page 12
   </em>
   , breach of the contract for the work of the dams contains a cross clause with the SWAP pending payment and the Belgrano Cargas modernization project.
  </p>
<p>
   “If China decides to execute these credits, the country could face debts for more than USD 30,000 million dollars (USD 18,000 of the SWAP, USD 4700 of the dams and punitorial costs that also reach the Belgrano loads estimated at just under USD 10,000 million) ” (

     March 24 and April 2 in the streets

<p>
   As every year, this March 24 our town will take to the streets and squares throughout the country to express their repudiation to the genocidal coup that established the Videla-Viola dictatorship in 1976.
  </p>
<p>
   This year we will mobilize with all the slogans reaffirmed in the fight against dictatorship and in later years, and especially against the denialist policy of the Milei government.
  </p>
<p>
   From the PCR we promote the widest unit in all the places of the country in front of a government in which the president denies the 30 thousand kidnapped and missing, and with a vice president that has openly claimed the dictatorship. A government that has a repressive policy towards popular struggles, and easy trigger for repressive forces.
  </p>
<p>
   A government that, in the face of drug trafficking growth, returns to repressive forces in popular neighborhoods. While taking the gendarmerie from our borders that are a strainer, and does not touch the ports, the airports, controlled by the true owners of the narconegocios.
  </p>
<p>
   It is now known that Justice Minister Cúneo Libarona was a defender of large drug traffickers.
  </p>
<p>
   Before the commemoration of the 42th Anniversary of the Patriotic Reconquest of the Falkland Islands, on April 2, 1982, we promote acts throughout the country in tribute to our fallen and our Malvinas heroes in front of Milei's pro -English policy and Foreign Minister Mondino .
  </p>
<p>
   In the city of Buenos Aires, the traditional act of the patriotic and popular forum will be held with the veterans, in the Cenotapio of Plaza San Martín, in front of the Retiro station.
  </p>
<p>
   This 42 anniversary occurs with a government that kneels against English imperialism that takes over our islands and waters, and the Yankee imperialism that gave him the missiles that murdered 649 Malvinenses patriots.

   Amid the struggles against this policy of hunger, repression and delivery of the Milei government, the debate between the great masses grows. How do you get out of this crisis situation in favor of the people and the country?
  </p>

   The government bets to deepen the social, political and cultural division with all its communication apparatus. Sells the individual path and hate solidarity.

   From the PCR, the JCR and the mass movements that we integrate, keeping us at the forefront of the concrete struggle for each and every one of the popular emergencies, we fight for the widest unit to twist the arm to this policy. Because nobody is saved alone.
  </p>
<p>
   The struggles are making their way to a new active and multisectoral national strike, which gives a new blow to this hunger and delivery government.
  </p>
<p>
   The mobilizations of March 24 and April 2 have to pay this path.
  </p>
<p>
   As we have been raising, there is money in the country. The discussion is who has it and what is used for. The government maintains the punctual payment of the debt with the IMF and external bonds, and carries out a policy that continues to fill the pockets of those that are carried in shovel.
  </p>
<p>
   In this situation, the growth and strengthening of the PCR and its JCR is essential, to live up to the stormy times that we live, and conquer another policy and another government.
  </p>
<p>
   On this path, with the ATEs ATE in Caba Colmado, the JCR honored our beloved otto Vargas 5 years after his death. With a talk by Jacinto Roldán, current general secretary of the PCR, we remember who headed our party from the Foundation, until his death on 2/2/2019.
  </p>
<p>
   Towards the closing Jacinto said: “The best tribute we can do to Otto is that the PCR, his party, continues to fight for leading the struggles, today against Milei's policies. And continue to grow for what is coming, because we fight for a revolution that ends this oligarchic-imperialist state, so that we can solve bread, roof, work, land, health and education of all those who inhabit all those who inhabit those who inhabit our soil ”.

<strong>
   The UN Relief Organization for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA) reports that more children should have been killed in Gaza over the past four months, than total in conflicts throughout the world over the last four years. They point out that more than 12,300 children have been killed in Gaza.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  Philippe Lazzarini, commander of Unrwa, calls the numbers of killed children "staggering" and states that this war is a war on children, and against the children's childhood and future. He has referred to UN figures showing that 12,193 children were killed in war in the world between 2019 and 2022, while the health authorities of the Gaza Strip have reported that more than 12,300 children have been killed in the Palestinian area since October 7, 2023.
 </p>
<p>
  As of March 17, al-Jazeera reports that more than 13,000 children have now been killed, and the genocide is intensified when 1.5 million people in Gaza are now threatened by famine. Already, children of hunger die every day, while Israel blocks the importation of food and other necessities. Emergency aid is unloaded on trucks at the border of Gaza, but is denied by the Zionist State.
 </p>
<p>
  Unrwa also reports that relief workers are killed and injured in the war. They have lost more than 160 employees as a result of the war against Gaza. Israel has accused Unrwa of having Hamas members among its employees who participated in the attack on October 7, which has led to a number of countries, including the United States, withdrawn the support of UNRWA. This shows that Israel targeted not only attacks the Palestinian people with bombing homes and hospitals, and also exposes 1.5 million people to starvation, but that they also targeted all forms of emergency aid, including UN-Bistand. All the time under the protection of the Security Council member the United States, who systematically closes its veto unlike his lackeys in Israel.

  The government's persecution industry is expanding against teachers and workers with dozens of lawsuits and civilizations throughout Greece and with a special way against Piraeus teachers, upgrading the settled indictment.
 </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The dismissal of the EKPA employee, the prosecutions of the president of the Piraeus Labor Center, to the president of PENEN, and even Mitsotakis' recent statements about the deletions of the students who occupy a continuation of the political and trade union industry and is an integral part of the industry. Public and political life. It is clear that the system has one goal alone. To put the resistance, the claim, the struggle to illegally. To put in illegality the class union and political action, to crush democratic rights and political freedoms, but also any collective racing expression against the anti -populist anti -labor policy of the system.
 </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  They want a school adapted to the labor and social medieval times that attempt to impose. They want to prepare the youth for modern slaves of capitalism. They want teachers to work without rights, with their head bent, aligned and obedient performers of their class reactive policy.
 </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The government is stepping up persecution at a time when it is escalating the attack on training with a host of bills and cutting off private universities, facing the fair struggle of students and students with the intensity of state terrorism and repression. With prosecutors, with arrests of students, with the state mechanism of directors and rectors in the campaign of threats, strokeing demonstrations, with military -type repressive interventions at universities to evacuate the democratic determinations. Asylum.
 </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The government and the system are sending a message to the "enemy" people that anti -populist politics will pass with "fire and iron". How the only "regularity" is the profitability of local and foreign capital. In this regularity they want to subdue the people by unlawful student and student occupations, farmers 'blocks, workers' strikes, defense of popular housing, gatherings, demonstrations, trade unions and political action. For this reason, the system intensifies the policy of fascism, equipped the repressive mechanisms, is fortified by a number of laws that abolish democratic rights.
 </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  In this context, teachers are persecuted by a system that is scared and runs to prevent the accumulated rage and indignation of the people, workers and youth not turning into a struggle, a popular uprising for the right to study, at work, in Freedoms, in life. They are afraid of the power of popular, workers and youth struggles. They know that the right of the struggle is more powerful than state violence, that the popular struggle can fear their real nightmare. They don't scare us, they don't terrorize us. We continue on the road to the relentless and incompatible fight with high fists.

   In the late evening of yesterday, various patrols of the Carabinieri Radiomobile Operational Unit carried out home searches at the home of three Si Cobas unionists, active in the front row in the fight against the Maxi of Belfiore: Asmerom Zemenfia and Abbas Mohsan of the national executive and Florina Ghiorghita of the national coordination.

<div dir="auto" style="text-align: start;">
   All three companions were seized by cell phones and their respective SIMs, considered "body of the crime", relating to the strikes started from June last year to claim the actual and integral application of the CCNL freight and logistics transport in the warehouse of the GDO of Belfiore, and which in recent weeks has produced 17 days of strike and garrisons outside the gates following the will of the new supplier (the Manhandwork Cooperative) not to recognize the SI Cobas, largely majority among the workers.

<div class="x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r x1vvkbs xtlvy1s x126k92a">
<div dir="auto" style="text-align: start;">
   The main charges, needless to say, are the usual: private violence, resistance to public officials and road blocking as well as "revised and corrected" by the new security decree of the Meloni government.

</div>
<div class="x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r x1vvkbs xtlvy1s x126k92a">
<div dir="auto" style="text-align: start;">
   Evidently the Prosecutor of Verona, who issued the search mandate, intends to use the seizures of the personal goods of our companions as an intimidation tool in order to stop

   The strikes outside the Maxidi warehouses and the protests of the workers who have developed in recent weeks also on the-sales points, reaching the point of expressing assessments of merit on the rightness or otherwise of the strikes: an all political judgment that should exhate from the role and by the Duties of a prosecutor ...
  </div>
<div dir="auto" style="text-align: start;">
   Indeed, the investigation deeds accuse the strikers of having turned on fires to warm up during the garrison at night, and even justify the imminent aggression of a company vigilante that last month, as well as widely documented by us, He came to point the gun in the face of workers !!!

<div dir="auto" style="text-align: start;">
   As far as we are concerned, we strongly report this yet another repressive and intimidating act towards our organization, and we reiterate once again that the legitimacy of the strikes decide are not the courts nor the owners, but the workers: those workers who in the Strike put their wages and their jobs at stake in order to eliminate exploitation, hunger wages and anti -union reprisals.

    Government propaganda justification of the ELAS repressive operation At the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki's sciences from the system's parrots, it reaches the levels of ridicule. After the huge size and a large number of police bodies (MAT, OPKE, EKAM, etc.) at a student party in the FAI organized as part of the occupations of student clubs, where (literally) people were caught with ... cocktails ... In the hands, with a total account of 49 arrested/affiliates, we now hear about the alleged "nuclear rifle" and "attack" on the nuclear reactor in the basement of the FROM that was supposedly according to "TA NEWS".

    Within the FAI, as long as we are able to know, there are experimental provisions of a few millions of euros.

    Following the adoption of the Pierrakakis law, the revenge fury of the system will intensify and has already given significant writing samples. Mitsotakis himself threatens with discipline and deletions. Only the continuation of the struggles, the mass of procedures and the persistent in the direction of resistance to the education of the few and the chosen can set conditions for substantial response to fascist and overthrow of the law.

  Rose is the Importer of the exploited, oppressed and oppressed peoples whose heads are against the oppressors and the exploiters of thousands of years of class societies in our geography. Today it has become the name of the uprising and resistance of all oppressed peoples, especially the Kurdish people against the oppressors and the exploiters. The Kaw uprising was the mourning against the brutal massacres committed by the "Al -Dahaqi", and the burning of the rebellion in all angles.
 </p>
<p align="right">
  We receive the feast of Nowruz in a period in which the cruel attacks and massacres of Al -Dahaqi are increasing in the international arena and in our geography. We are in a stage where new imperialist war conditions are mature for imperialist division and are prepared. The increasing competition for the growing imperialist bourgeoisie leads to conflicts and occupations at the regional level. It is not limited to competition and "commercial wars" between imperialist blocs. It also increases the possibility of direct military confrontation. While the war between imperialist camps is directly developing with the war of the Russian occupation of Ukraine into a "long -term war", and some spokesman for the bourgeoisie cast statements that "we must be ready for war."
 </p>
<p align="right">
  The increasing competition between imperial monopolies increases the aggression of reactionary forces in our geography. They raise their heads to take advantage of the crisis for their own interests, expand their dominance areas and keep their locations. After the reactionary occupation of the Azerbaijani occupation of Nagurani Karabakh, and the attacks by Israeli Zionism after the flood of October 7 of the Palestinian National Resistance turned into genocide. To face the oppressed Palestinian people, a new catastrophe.
 </p>
<p align="right">
  The Turkish state, which is one of the most reactionary forces in our geography, continues its aggression against the Kurdish nation with its daily terrorist attacks on the lands of the self -administration of northeastern Syria - Rojava and the invasion attacks against Iraqi Kurdistan. The Turkish state is preparing for a comprehensive attack and invasion to liquidate the gains of the Rojava Revolution to compensate for the heavy military losses that it incurred in Iraqi Kurdistan. The Turkish state aims, by liquidating the gains of the Kurdish National Liberation Movement, to occupy the region and then annex it. She wants to achieve its centuries -old goal "Musk Melli" with the consent of the imperialists and with the approval of its reactionary lines cooperating with it in the region.
 </p>
<p align="right">
  For this purpose, after negotiations with the reactionary forces in the region, a deal was held at the door of American imperialism. The traditional policy of the fascist Turkish Republic of "taking advantage of the contradictions between imperialist camps" has returned. Preparing again to attack persecuted peoples in our geography, especially the Kurdish people. For this, the policy of isolation is implemented on revolutionary and national prisoners, especially Abdullah Ocalan, the leader of the Kurdish National Freedom Movement. On the other hand, pressure and arrests against the revolutionaries continue.
 </p>
<p align="right">
  The reason for this aggression is from Turkish fascism, which is not independent of the situation you are experiencing. The system of repression and exploitation that lasted a century in the form of complete bankruptcy, especially in the economy. As we witnessed in the earthquakes of February 6, we are facing the reality of an anti -people system that does nothing while tens of thousands of people wait for help under the rubble, and prevents those who go to help. The government will respond to the people's call to help with the curses, and this is what was issued by the mouth of RTA, Erdogan himself, who used to say about the people that he is "immoral, a bastard, an honor"; Hence, he is once again asking this people to give them their voices. The general elections did not solve the ruling class crisis, but rather failed to postpone them. In the current stage, they are struggling again to share the rent, this time through the local elections.
 </p>
<p align="right">
  While the ruling classes continue to struggle for rent and blocs between them, the poverty of workers and the toilers increases. Dozens of workers are killed every day in labor murders. There is an increase in massacres and hate crimes against women and various sexual identities. The massacres of nature and the environment for rent and capitalist looting continue at the utmost speed. The policy of extermination, denial and repression against the persecuted nationalities and beliefs, especially the Kurdish nation, continues. The policly implemented policies to preserve its authority have created a state of social madness in which it commits torture massacres even for stray animals.
 </p>
<p align="right">
  Turkish fascism, in the face of this image that she made with her government and opposition, does what she is good at, nourishes racism and chauvinism, under the name "social values", and increases her fascist repression against all segments that do not actually obey her. Sunni Islam, which is the prevailing belief in Turkish fascism, is used as a way to suppress various beliefs and to prevent the toilers from rebellion against the conditions of hunger and poverty that they were forced. While the policy of “prayer for Palestine, and sending ships for Israel” continues, the fascist aggression continues for those who do not comply with their heads.
 </p>
<p align="right">
  Al -Dahqi is the cruelty today in their work. For their wealth, they continue to rob, extortion and massacres against the rights of the region, especially the people of our country. They are preparing for new invasions and attacks to remain on their systems based on corruption and theft. However, there will always be there as many such as "Kawa Al -Haddad" who will stand in their face
 </p>
<p align="right">
  It is time to be the mourning against the unjust al -Dahaqi. It's time for resistance and struggle. Now is the time to stand against the oppressors.
 </p>
<p align="right">
  Our slogan against destruction, deprivation and assimilation; And occupation and annexation; Exploitation, hunger, poverty and fascism is Nerose.
 </p>
<p align="right">
  Stand against the fascism, spread the fires of Nayroz everywhere!

  Newroz is the symbol of the revolt of the exploited and oppressed peoples against the oppressors and exploiters in the thousands of years of class societies in our geography. Today, it has become the name of the rebellion and resistance of all oppressed peoples, especially the Kurdish people, against the persecution of cruelty, the rebellion of the blacksmith Kawa against the cruel and massacring Dehaks, and the burning of the fires of rebellion in all four corners.
 </p>
<p>
  We are welcoming Newroz in a period in which the attacks and massacres of the cruel Dehaks are increasing worldwide and in our geography. We are in a process where the conditions for a new imperialist sharing war are maturing and preparations are being made for it. The increasing rivalry of the imperialist bourgeoisie is triggering conflicts and occupations at the regional level. There are not only rivalries and “trade wars” between the imperialist blocs. The possibility of direct military confrontation is also increasing. As Russia’s war of occupation of Ukraine evolves into a “protracted war”  war between the imperialist camps, some spokespersons of the bourgeoisie make statements that “we must be ready for war”.
 </p>
<p>
  The increasing rivalry between imperialist monopolies is increasing the aggression of reactionary forces in our geography. They raise their heads to take advantage of the crisis for their own interests, to expand their areas of domination and to hold positions. After the Azerbaijani reactionary occupation of Artsakh-Nagorno-Karabakh, the attacks launched by Israeli Zionism, citing the October 7 Flood of the Palestinian national resistance, turned into genocide. The oppressed Palestinian people were confronted with a new Nakba (catastrophe).
 </p>
<p>
  The Turkish state, one of the most reactionary forces in our geography, continues its aggression against the Kurdish nation with daily terrorist attacks on the territory of the Autonomous Administration of Northeast Syria-Rojava and invasion attacks against Iraqi Kurdistan. It is preparing for a comprehensive invasion attack to liquidate the gains of the Rojava Revolution and to eliminate the heavy military losses it suffered in Iraqi Kurdistan. While liquidating the gains of the Kurdish National Freedom Movement, the Turkish state is aiming for occupation and then annexation in the region. It wants to realize its centuries-old “Misak-ı Milli” goal with the approval of the imperialists and with its own collaborator reactionary lines in the region.
 </p>
<p>
  For this purpose, after negotiations with the reactionary forces of the region, a bargain was struck at the door of US imperialism. The fascist Turkish Republic’s traditional policy of “taking advantage of the contradictions between the imperialist camps” is once again in effect. Once again, preparations are being made to attack the oppressed peoples of our geography, especially the Kurdish people. For this, the isolation policy is being implemented on revolutionary and patriotic prisoners, especially Abdullah Öcalan, the leader of the Kurdish National Freedom Movement. On the other hand, pressure and arrest attacks against revolutionaries continue.
 </p>
<p>
  The reason for this aggression of the Turkish fascism is not independent of the situation it is in. The century-old regime of oppression and exploitation is in a picture of complete bankruptcy, especially in the economy. As we have witnessed in the Earthquakes of February 6, while tens of thousands of people are waiting for help under the debris, they were faced with a reality of an enemy of the people who did nothing and prevented those who go to help. The government, which responded to the people’s call for help from the mouth of R.T. Erdogan himself with the curses “You’re immoral, you’re despicable, you’re dishonorable”; At the current stage, he is once again asking for votes from the people. The general elections did not solve the crisis of the ruling classes and even failed to postpone it. At the current stage, they are once again struggling for rent sharing, this time on the occasion of local elections.
 </p>
<p>
  While the ruling classes continue to fight for rent and cliques within themselves, the poverty of workers and laborers is increasing. Dozens of workers are murdered every other day in workplace murders. There is an increase in massacres and hate crimes against women and other gender identities. Massacres of nature and the environment for the sake of capitalist rent and plunder continue at full speed. The policy of annihilation, denial, assimilation and oppression against oppressed nationalities and beliefs, especially the Kurdish nation, continues. The policies implemented by fascism to maintain its power have created a situation of social insanity in which torturous massacres of stray animals are committed.
 </p>
<p>
  Turkish state fascism, facing this picture it has created with its government and opposition, does what it knows best, fueling racism and chauvinism, under the name of “social values”, it increases its fascist oppression against “those who are not like itself” and in reality against all segments that do not obey it. Sunni Islam, the dominant belief of Turkish fascism, is used as a means of oppressing different beliefs and to prevent the working and laboring people from rebelling against the conditions of hunger and poverty they are forced into. While the policy of “Prayers for Palestine, Ships for Israel” is continued with determination, fascist aggression against those who do not bow their heads continues.
 </p>
<p>
  Today’s cruel Dehaks are at work. They continue their robbery, extortion and massacres against the people of the region, especially the people of our country, for their own wealth and riches. They are preparing new invasions and attacks for the survival of their regimes built on corruption and theft. However, there are and will always be blacksmith Kawas against the cruel Dehaks.
 </p>
<p>
  It is time to be the blacksmith Kawa against the cruel Dehaks. Now is the time to resist and struggle. Now is the time to stand up against the oppressors.
 </p>

   The 
 German State is hitting the Turkish and Kurdish left structures 
 with even greater severity. Unfortunately, this is almost 
 unknown by the public. With an artificial accusation of terrorism (§ 
 129b), people are imprisoned over and over again, even if 
 They are not personally accused of a crime. The alleged 
 belonging to PKK (Kurdistan workers' party) or al 
 DHKP-C (Turkish revolutionary organization) is sufficient for 
 several years in prison, making Germany the tyrapy of 
 Erdogan.

  Newroz is a symbol of the uprising of peoples who have become mêwarder and oppressed against the storms and thousands of years of Chinese communities in the geography. Today has become the name of the uprising and resistance of all oppressed peoples, especially the Kurdish people, the uprising of Kawa Hesincer, who raised up against the deaf and massacre, and the fire of the rebellion. .
 </p>
<p>
  We meet Newroz at a time when the attacks and the dead masses are increasing in the international area and our geography. We are on a period of time that the conditions of a new warplan of imperialist war are happening and its preparations are being made. The increased competition of imperialism is launched at the region levels. Between imperialist blades are not only competitive and "commercial wars". The possibility of a military warfare is also increasing. Because the Russian war of Ukraine and direct warfare between imperialist camps comes to "long fighting", some bourgeook spokes, "We have to be ready for the war".
 </p>
<p>
  The increase in competition between imperialist monuments attacks the backward forces in our geography. Put your head to benefit from the disruption to your interest, expand your control field and protect yourself. After the occupation of Artsakh-Karabax, the attacks on Israeli politics and the Palestinian Statistics have turned to genocide. The oppressed Palestinians took place with the new disaster.
 </p>
<p>
  The Turkish state is one of the most recent forces of our geography, their attacks on the Kurdish people continue with terrorist attacks on the territory of North East Syrian Kurdistan and occupying attacks on Iraqi Kurdistan. In order to eliminate the gains of the Western Revolution and the elimination of severe military casualties in Iraqi Kurdistan, Iraqi protests. The Turkish state was aimed in the area when eliminating the Kurdish National Freedom Freedom Movement Gains, and after the occupation of the area. It wants to fulfill the "National Convention" in the region with the approval of the imperialists, with its partner's background lines in the region.
 </p>
<p>
  For this reason, the market was marketed in front of the US Emperality Forces after the negotiations with the region. The fascist state of the fascist Republic of the "conflict between imperialist camps benefits" it is once again. Once again, the preparations are made against the oppressed peoples in our geography. Therefore, on revolutionary and patriotic prisoners, specialization policy is conducted on the Kurdish National Freedom Movement leader Abdullah Ocalan. On the other hand, the pressure and attacks against revolutionaries are continuing.
 </p>
<p>
  The reason for the attack of the Turkish fascism is not available from the situation in which it is not available. The contentious, source and brutal and brutal and brutal regime is for centuries, especially the economy is in a state of bankruptcy. Just as we saw in the earthquake on February 6, when we waiting for ten thousand people, we actually come to the people's enemy regime that does not do anything and lead to those who go to help. The government has responded to the gel helped calls with the mouth of R.T.ERDOG. Wishing no votes again on this. The general elections did not solve the dominant class crisis and could not tolerate it. On this one again to share rant, this time also struggling in the form of local elections.
 </p>
<p>
  During the dominant classes fighting for the rant and supporters among themselves, workers and laborers are even more. Dozens of workers are being murdered in the works of work every day. Massacres and crimes against women and different sexual identities increase. The massacres of nature and environment for earning capitalists and storms continue with all speeds. The policy of destruction, assimilation, assimilation and violence against international nations and beliefs are especially on the Kurdish nation. The policies that Fascism continues to power, has created a situation of religion that is being tortured against the networks of free of charge.
 </p>
<p>
  Turkish fascism against this situation that has built his power and opposition, what is the best of the racism and succeed in the name of the "social values" against the "not such as it" and in their reality And the fascist oppression increases the sections of the community that do not listen to it. Sunni Islam that is the dominant belief in the Turkish fascism and is used as a tool; To press the pressure on different beliefs and do not allow workers and labor to prevent workers and laborers against the conditions and poverty. During the policy "prayer for Palestine, the ship to Israel will continue to attack the fascist attack against those who do not give their heads.
 </p>
<p>
  Today's zalims are at work today. For its own homes and properties, defending and genocide of the area, especially the people of our country and the people of the region. In order to stay the rest of their regimes that are built on corruption and stealing, new preparations and attacks do. However, there are always iron-sized weeds against the wicked dairies and there will be.
 </p>
<p>
  Time to oppose the tenants of the cruelty, the buying of Kawa is an iron. It is no longer for resistance and struggle. There is no time to stand up against the wicked.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
    Our password against fall, denial and assimilation; Occupation and processing; The stimulation, hunger, poverty and fascism; Is Newroz.

<strong>
   Our comrades in Socialist Revolution write about changes in the requirements for military service in Denmark, and warn of preparations for interimperialist attack war.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  De skriver om det danske forsvarets bestemmelse om å fjerne krav minstekravet for høyde (155cm) og krav om BMI. Forandringene i kravene var begrunnet med at opptil 50 prosent av de som møter til sesjon blir avvist. Forandringene kommer i tillegg til et initiativ for å fordoble antall vernepliktige ved å inkludere kvinner. Dansk imperialisme, gjennom borgerlige medier, vil framstille det som et feministisk initiativ, og presse det gjennom som et grep for likestilling. Både fjerning av krav for verneplikt og inkludering av kvinner i militæret er den danske imperialismens forsøk på å forberede seg til nye imperialistiske konflikter og angrepskriger som de skal delta i som del av NATO.
 </p>
<p>
  It is also easy to see similar measures in Norway, where bourgeois media and a Breit range of bourgeois parties are trying to introduce military service for all young people who leave high school. Again, the reasons for this are that "we must increase readiness" and that we are in "demanding times". As in Denmark, many of the bourgeois parties agree with the proposal, from Red to the Progress Party. This, in addition to the military exercise "Cold Response", and new agreements on new American bases in Norway show how willing the imperialists are to recruit more people to waste in interimperialist attack wars, in service of bourgeoisie and Yankee emperialism.

<p>
  According to the testimony of Mauro Cid, the reserve general Braga Netto directed Lieutenant Colonel to seek money from the Liberal Party (PL), chaired by Valdemar Costa Neto, to pay the military of the army's “special forces” military (OS special forces ”(OS
  <em>
   kids
  </em>
  black) for manifestations of green chickens in Brasilia.
 </p>
<p>
  The money was initially requested Cid by Rafael Martins de Oliveira, one of the "special forces" scammers who was responsible for organizing the participation of
  <em>
   kids
  </em>
  Black in the Bolsonarist demonstrations. According to messages collected on Cid's cell phone, Oliveira requested CID R $ 100,000 and guidelines of “places for the demonstrations”, as well as confirmations “if the armed forces would guarantee the permanence of people on site”.
 </p>
<p>
  Cid, in turn, went to Braga Netto to seek the source of money, which guided him to search the PL. Netto, at the time candidate for vice president on Bolsonaro's plate, worked exactly at the headquarters of the PL. As a logistics head of some party operations, the general had a room and a team of their own. In this position, it is likely that if Netto gave this guidance, some certainty had that the association would provide the money.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  The role of the military 'special forces'
 </h4>
<p>
  It is now known that the “special forces” of the Army played an important role in the far-right coup joint, especially in logistical and operational support to the manifestations of green chickens.
 </p>
<p>
  Force, considered as “elite” in the reactionary army, specializes in irregular operations, including sabotage and insurgency actions. There are several suspicions that point to the participation of the “Special Forces” in the second Bolsonada of 8/1, especially at critical moments such as the opening of the hatch and preparation of the material for the green chickens enter the building. Images show that, on the day, Balaclava figures (dress that is part of the “special forces” uniform), played a role on the front line and directly guided some actions.
 </p>
<p>
  Other evidence of the participation of the military of the "special forces" in the coup articulation are Cid's own messages. In addition to the request for money by Martins, other conversations reveal that the military was used by Bolsonaro's aides in organizing acts and organizing the culmination of the coup. Exchanges of messages with the former "special forces" Bernardo Romão Correia Neto also proved that Neto was responsible for organizing a meeting with several "special forces" in the ballrooms of residential buildings in Brasília and in the drafting of the "Letter to the Commander of the Army of Senior Active Duty Officers of the Brazilian Army", signed by hundreds of officers and intended to pressure the then commander Freire Gomes for institutional rupture.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Who are and where are the rest?
 </h4>
<p>
  Both the letter and the "special forces" meeting raise important questions about the investigation. For the Federal Police, it is essential to find out who paid for the military's trip to Brasilia. This is important, but it may not be the most crucial.
 </p>
<p>
  Another issue of paramount importance, perhaps even greater, is the very identification of these military. Who are the special forces who attended the meeting in Brasilia with members of the coup core? Where are they today? And how many were exactly, and who they are, the
  <strong>
   Senior Officers
  </strong>
  who signed the letter for the institutional rupture in November 2022, a document that, when issued, the Army sought to demoralize by calling it an initiative of "people from the reserve"? It is known that two of the redactors were colonels, then on active duty:
  <a href="https://anovademocracia.com.br/altos-oficiais-da-ativa-redigiram-carta-para-pressionar-comandante-do-exercito-a-ruptura-institucional-aberta/">
   Giovani Pasini and Alexandre Bitencourt
  </a>
  . Cid, Oliveira, Romão Correia Neto and Braga Netto may have helped, the first three of the active. Which others? What about those who signed? Freire Gomes has already stated before, without evidence, that the military has been identified and punished, but other evidence shows that this is not entirely true: General Estevam Theophilo, for example, a member of the Bolsonarist Center, said he did not punish the subordinates who They signed the letter beyond a "drawing attention for the breaking of hierarchy."
 </p>
<p>
  These are questions to be taken into consideration. After all, it is already known that those in the military leadership who refused to participate in the institutional rupture
  <a href="https://anovademocracia.com.br/luiz-inacio-deveria-se-preocupar-com-os-generais-legalistas/">
   they did not do so out of an immutable principle, but because of the lack of support from the United States (USA) and the fear of a revolutionary uprising of the masses against the coup
  </a>
  . Today, they continue to intervene in national political life, as the “moderating power” who understand that they are (as Freire Gomes himself admitted, in the letter signed by the three commanders in 2022).
 </p>
<p>
  In more burning scenarios, at different variables to international levels, and under new pressures of most of those who supported the rupture and continue in the barrack, what will be the choice of the new commander?

   This is a debate article. Analysis and standpoint are the writer's own.
  </em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
   On March 6, the reindeer owners in the North Fosen Siida accepted a final settlement prepared by the state and energy company Roan Vind
  </strong>
  .
  <strong>
   Eventually, the month-long negotiations in the disputed Fosen case have ended.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  Kort oppsummert gikk denne avtalen ut på at de ulovlig oppsatte vindturbinene får stå ut konsesjonsperioden til 2043 i bytte mot nye beitemarker og en årlig kompensasjon på til sammen rundt 9 millioner kroner. Dermed slutter de seg til Sør-Fosen siida som gjorde en lignende avtale i desember i fjor.
 </p>
<p>
  As the saying says, it is easier to ask for forgiveness than permission. The Fosen case again demonstrates that the bourgeois state, with its monopoly capitalists, can freely ignore its own laws and international obligations. All in 2018, the UN announced that the human rights of the reindeer husbandry were in danger of being broken and asking the Norwegian state to stop the development until the case was completed. Their concerns were eventually confirmed by the unanimous Supreme Court judgment of 2021.
 </p>
<p>
  Men med unntak av at det har vært svært pinlig politisk for statsminister Jonas Gahr Støre og hans regjering, har de og utbygger alt i alt fått det slik de ønsket. Til NRK uttalte Støre blant annet: «Mekling har vært en bedre måte å ta hensyn til begge parter, som har ønsket å frem med [sic], på en god måte. Det har vi oppnådd her.»
 </p>
<p>
  That there is any equality between the parties is ridiculous. The state and Roan Vind went out the negotiations until they finally managed to break down the resistance and buy away the affected reindeer owners. In addition to this, the activists who at all dared to fight this injustice were

   Ølvation
  </a>
  .
 </p>
<p>
  Although the Sami Parliament has reported that they want an independent investigation into the Fosen case, it is naive to believe that it will have some further consequences. The Sami Parliament is nothing but combadoric entity if the main task is to legitimize the dominance of the Norwegian state over Sápmi
  <a href="#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1">
   [1]
  </a>
  And facilitates further re -development of these lands. We see an example of their comradoric character in the commentary on Sami president Silje Karine Muotka. She welcomes the "compromise" and also tells NRK that she is pleased that the parties have reached an agreement and further that it will lay the foundation for this breach of human rights to be "repaired".
 </p>
<p>
  The fact that this case is now a laid back chapter is the well -known artist and activist Ella Marie Hætta Isaksen disagree with: "This is no victory, and I know many people had wanted to asth [sic] There would be a happy ending to it here." She is one of several tens of shareholders who have been tried after refusing to pay fines for occupying government buildings and the Storting - actions that the police first praised! She goes on to NRK that there must be an error in the system when the state can start the development without a final legal decision and that they can subsequently impose negotiations.
 </p>
<p>
  Som kommunister vet vi at Fosensaken og andre lignende overtramp ikke er noe form for «systemfeil» men rett og slett er vanlig praksis i kapitalismen. Behovet er derfor større enn noen gang for å bygge virkelig uavhengige organisasjoner som beskytter folkets rettigheter og som konsekvent bryter med legalisme og borgerlig parlamentarisme. Bare da kan blant annet samenes kamp for rettferdighet og nasjonalt selvråderett bli realisert.

  On March 3 there was a protest against the destruction of the natural environment committed by the organizers of the Stock Car automobile event, such as the cut of dozens of trees on the Esplanade of Mineirão Stadium near the Federal University of Minas Gerais (MG). Protesters report that R $ 20 million have already been spent by the city of Belo Horizonte to hold this sporting event that has strong commercial appeal. The local correspondent
  <strong>
   AND
  </strong>
  He was present and collected complaints from representatives of social organizations and personalities who promoted the protest.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Cleiton Aguiar, researcher and professor at UFMG:
 </h4>
<p>
  “Stock Car around Mineirão will undermine scientific research at UFMG […] studies on sleep, rare diseases, cancer, vaccine development, other brain diseases such as Alzheimer's are widely affected with this event. There are millions of reais of public money invested in this type of research that is at stake. Most experimental research is done with rodents, rats and mice, which are night animals, sleep during the day. Most laboratory research are rats, which have high sound sensitivity. Stock car cars generate many noises. […]. The Stock Car event takes several days between training and the race itself. It will be several days of sleep deprivation of these animals. The scientific tests that are underway will be widely impaired. Will be years of research lost… ”
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Social organization “Ah, is it garbage?!”
 </h4>
<p>
  “They are trying to build a temporary use race track. The Belo Horizonte Master Plan establishes that Autodrome is licensed and has a normative deliberation of the Municipal Environment Council that includes a racing activity as an activity of great environmental impact, defining that more than 10,000 square meters of useful area is an race track large.
 </p>
<p>
  Here, taking the area of Mineirão, 85 thousand square meters, that is, they want to build an race track without going through due environmental licensing process, in a size that is
  <strong>
   eight and a half times and a half
  </strong>
  The limit to consider itself large. No studies of locational alternatives. When you are going to do any environmental feasibility analysis, the first thing you do is a study of locational alternatives to see possibilities to receive that venture, with reduced environmental impacts, and we have options, having much less impact.
 </p>
<p>
  They chose to pass in front of the University Hospital, a hospital area, and placed the point of more noise of the stock car, which reaches almost 110 decibels, in front of the veterinary hospital. The contract allows the surrounding roads to be cleared for 19 days every year (5 years). Why not do at Pampulha airport? There is an opposite straight line of almost 3 kilometers that would receive the best stock car in Brazil
  <em>
   ”.
  </em>
</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Social Organization ‘Instituto Samaran’
 </h4>
<p>
  “Here we have domestic animals that walk around here, birds that are already used to, 1500 birds that make this dormitory area, 138 species, and one of them is in world extinction. Why did she stop here? Because she got a safety, a comfort. […] We would like them to present a management plan with the animals. […] The counselors (Comam, Municipal Council of the Environment) did not want to make a technical visit on site. Our question is: What's the problem? What impediment would this visit bring? So we want the transparency and presentation of the documents we ask for the Coman counselors.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Social Organization ‘Project Pomar BH’
 </h4>
<p>
  “We plant fruit trees throughout the metropolitan region and we go against what the city is doing with the suppression of trees. While we have more than 5,000 trees planted, the city is destroying 73 trees that do not even plant 2,500 will have the same benefit. These trees here are over 30, 40 years old. If you cut such a tree and plant a seedling that represents a branch, the benefit will not be the same. It will take a long time for them to grow, if they survive, that the city is making planting out of the period. ”
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Social Organization ‘Preserves BH’
 </h4>
<p>
  "There are studies on the technical feasibility of this realization of the construction of an automobile station on the site precisely because of the width of the track, because it does not support the public that Stock Car expects to receive, due to the topography itself, it would not be the most appropriate place. There are other more appropriate places in Belo Horizonte that were not even considered as possibilities.

  Supported by popular movements, the residents of the Luiz Gomes occupation in Campina Grande made, on March 16, a brigade to finish the work to implant water pipes and thus enable quality access to water for all.
 </p>
<p>
  On the evening of the same day, there was also a victorious celebration of the International Day of Proletarian Women with speeches, raffles and a great tribute to comrade Perla Albuquerque Lima, a resident of the occupation who died just over a month ago, naming the Popular School after her.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Project
 </h4>
<p>
  Last year, residents of the Luiz Gomes occupation, with the support of CDP-CG (Campina Grande Popular Defense Comment), the Metropolis Observatory and the Green Campina Collective, were able to approve a project to implement the sewage and water through from the NGO Habitat to Humanity Brazil.
 </p>
<p>
  The NGO provided a project based on the purchase of materials and hiring some essential services for the progress of the work, but since the main direction of the money was the purchase of materials, it was necessary that the residents and supporters of Occupation unite forces, working together to improve their housing conditions. Thus, the work that began in September/2023, is expected to end the month of March/2024.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Celebrations and honors
 </h4>
<p>
  Uniting collectives, supporters and residents, the brigade was held on March 9 in order to accelerate the work in force. In addition to the work in the work itself, a collective feijoada was also prepared in the popular school kitchen, activities with children and sweepstakes for those present.
 </p>
<p>
  There was also a moment of celebration and honors to emphasize the importance of International Proletarian Women's Day, with women of the occupation present, when a pamphlet was published by the Popular Women's Movement.

  Finally, but not least, the tribute to the companion Perla. Perla was a woman in the fight, despite her serious health problems (fought lupus), was present in this fight for housing since the beginning, in 2020, when she raised her small canvas shack. Perla has always been present in the school activities, participating in training courses, ensuring the organization and preservation of the school and also showing interest in teaching reinforcement classes for children.
 </p>
<p>
  Last January, the partner Perla passed away after contracted Covid, a picture that complicated her health problem already affected by Lupus. Mother of 4 children, Perla left her small shack, who over these years, with a lot of effort, turned into a masonry house, but, more than that, left the example for so many other women who are in the fight for the fight for home. Therefore, to remember this great companion, the school was named “Popular School Perla Albuquerque Lima”.

  And the mayor?
 </h4>
<p>
  While residents build their housing infrastructure and struggle more and more for dignity, the mayor, in an election year, promised to have the electricity poles install in the occupation, which currently still has very precarious lighting. The promise was made last year, on the first day of the exhaustion works, giving it a period of 15 days, but, as expected, the people are still without the promised posts.
 </p>
<p>
  The mayor doubts the intelligence and capacity of the organized people: while promising worlds and funds in the hope of getting votes, it maintains in court a process of repossession of the land where the occupation Luiz Gomes was established.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  In Mexico, a broad and lively campaign is currently unfolding to boycott the upcoming presidential elections of the old Mexican state, which will take place on June 2nd.
  <a href="https://muralperiodico.wordpress.com/2024/03/13/mexico-avances-sobre-el-boicot-contra-la-farsa-electoral/">
   The comrades of the democratic and revolutionary website Mural Periodico write about the peculiarity of the Mexican election campaign in a report on the activities of the activities.
  </a>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  In the election campaign, the election campaign as a central venue for contradictions and power is between the various political groups of the bureaucratic bourgeoisie, comprador bourgeoisie and large landowners also lead to violence between these parliamentary groups. The comrades report this since the start of the pre-campaign on November 6th last year there were a total of 23 murder of politicians from the bureaucrat capitalist-large state. Another proof that the factions of the ruling classes and their political staff are only concerned with personal power for their own interests and the elections are not held in the least in the interests of the people in order to advance the country.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Meanwhile, some powerful and combative actions against the election propaganda of the old Mexican state and the parties of the large bourgeoisie and large landowners took place as part of the election boycamping.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  In Chiapas in the south of Mexico, an attack on a building of the electoral authority occurred on February 21. In the attack, the building was thrown at stones and Molotov cocktails, which led to a fire inside the building which partially burned and set furniture on fire. This led to a large -scale deployment of the state police and the national guard as well as the fire brigade.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<img alt="wahlboykottmexiko2" src="https://demvolkedienen.org/images/Mexiko/2024/wahlboykottmexiko2.png" srcset="https://demvolkedienen.org/images/Mexiko/2024/wahlboykottmexiko2.png"/>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  In Mexican state of Oaxaca, various propaganda actions against the elections took place on March 4 during a major mobilization with over a thousand participants. In this way, participants of the demonstration of the various parties remove and brought the walls to the boycott of the elections. The distant voting propaganda was then under the slogans "Elections are not the solution, the solution is the revolution!" And "does not vote, prepare for the fight".
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<img alt="wahlboykottmexiko3" src="https://demvolkedienen.org/images/Mexiko/2024/wahlboykottmexiko3.png" srcset="https://demvolkedienen.org/images/Mexiko/2024/wahlboykottmexiko3.png"/>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  In the capital of the country, Mexico City, as part of the struggle for the tenth anniversary of 43 students, actions were carried out by police officers, in which the association of rural teachers and teaching students only expropriated a pick-up of the state electricity concentrate CFE And then with this pick-up, while severe fighting with the military and city police, broke a goal from the presidential palace.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<img alt="wahlboykottmexiko1" src="https://demvolkedienen.org/images/Mexiko/2024/wahlboykottmexiko1.png" srcset="https://demvolkedienen.org/images/Mexiko/2024/wahlboykottmexiko1.png"/>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  These powerful and brutal actions are not only an expression of the deep crisis in which bureaucratic capitalism and the old Mexican state are located, but also reflects the soul of the election boycott. The boycott of the elections refuses to legitimation to the old system and answers the question of how change can instead go to the fact that the popular masses, led by the revolutionaries, have to fight against the old system with revolutionary violence. This applies not only to the conditions in Mexico, but is a strategic question which applies to every country in the world, regardless of whether it is an oppressed nation or an imperialist nation.

  At the beginning of March, the UFPE Rectory, represented by Rector Alfredo Gomes, signed an agreement with the Military Institute of Engineering (IME), which aims at the advancement of technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and Cyber Security. The project also founded a course for this objective, which will begin in early 2025. Although promoted with the “development” discourse of IME and the university, the project serves to deepen the performance of the reactionary army at the university.
 </p>
<p>
  Rector Alfredo Gomes emphasizes the “importance of jointly building partnerships to strengthen such strategic and important areas for Brazil”, while the dean of the Military Institute of Engineering emphasizes the character of this partnership: “It is part of a strategic action of DCT (Department of Army science and technology), aiming at the most effective participation of the

   in various regions of the country
  </em>
  ”.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Specific moment
 </h4>
<p>
  The new step towards a greater military presence at the university does not occur in isolation. The reactionary armed force has received other recent incentives in the state, such as the construction of the Pernambuco Sergeants School, supported by the federal government.
 </p>
<p>
  The greater militarization occurs concomitantly with the advance of the peasant struggle in the state. In the municipality of
  <a href="https://anovademocracia.com.br/posseiros-da-mata-sul-pernambucana-defendem-suas-terras-e-rejeitam-acordos-com-latifundio/">
   Jaqueira, for example, squatters has resisted bluntly to the offensive of the landlord
  </a>
  . On the stairs, important peasant protests
  <a href="https://anovademocracia.com.br/pe-moradores-de-escada-fecham-br-101-no-terceiro-dia-seguido-apos-pm-executar-campones/">
   blocked roads after the execution of a peasant by a PM
  </a>
  .
 </p>
<p>
  In universities, the military presence can be seen as a threat to the development of the student struggle, especially if taken into account the constant demonstrations of support of the combative student movement to the fields in the field, from peasants, to indigenous and quilombolas.

<p>
  For the Federal Police, Bolsonaro's vaccination card falsification was part of the coup plan: the cards would ensure that the former president and his family could leave the country towards the United States before the set of scammers were executed. In addition to Mauro Cid and 15 other pockets, Jair Bolsonaro himself is investigated for falsifying covid-19 vaccine certificates.
 </p>
<p>
  The PF concluded what everyone already knew: that Jair Bolsonaro was not at the vaccination site on the counterfeit card and issued by Mauro Cid. What is relevant here is the relationship between the card and the coup plan. According to the PF report leaked to the press today, the card “may have been used by the group to allow its members, after the initial attempted coup d'état, could have available the necessary documents to meet any legal requirements For entry and stay abroad (vaccine card), awaiting the completion of acts related to the new attempted coup d'état that broke out on January 8, 2023 ″.
 </p>
<p>
  For the PF, the main thing is to collect evidence to imply Jair Bolsonaro in crimes. It is necessary to distinguish two fundamental points to understand what a supposed Bolsonaro prison will mean.
 </p>
<p>
  First, PF actions are useful to the STF, an institution led by the reactionary liberal right that leads the siege process to both Bolsonaro and some figuons of the genocidal armed forces. They reveal, in addition to concrete steps given in the goal of producing Jair Bolsonaro's arrest before the next elections, the demarcation between what is and what is not acceptable to his eyes.
 </p>
<p>
  A probable scenario is Jair Bolsonaro's conviction for a crime “against the Democratic Rule of Law” (which seems to be the trend today). In this sense, what was being condemned by the Brazilian justice is the application of a coup plan, specifically the one mounted by the far right-in which they also competed from both reserve and active. Another scenario is Bolsonaro's arrest for the case of jewelry (which are the subject of two other PF actions that should be completed in the next three months).
 </p>
<p>
  However, the second point that should be emphasized is the inability of the current siege of Bolsonaro led by STF forces (which, from its birth to the present, are reactionary, anti -communists and defenders of the old order of exploration) produce one step towards to the defense of democratic freedoms. In a scenario - which is not what is being done! -In which the Supreme Court investigated the set of active commanders who acted to give logistical and political support to the green chickens, after all, it would be formed a real and effective alternative to prevent the blows that will be planned (in the coming months and years) both by the far right and the hegemonic right in the high command of the Armed Forces.
 </p>
<p>
  The limits of the demarcation of the liberal right, expressed in the offensive of the Supreme Court, is clear when we found the rotund silence of these ministers of the use of the law “in defense of the Democratic Rule of Law” against young activists arrested and prosecuted for manifesting in São Paulo, to stay only in one example. The same law used to indict Bolsonaro is used to arrest protesters. What would be the diagnosis of the one who claims that democratic freedoms are not threatened today?
 </p>
<p>
  This is the unenforceable duty of the popular, progressive and democratic forces: to defend democratic freedoms, mobilizing the people and giving life to the only and effective alternative to the coup of the military.

  On Tuesday, March 19, the III Jury Court in Rio de Janeiro was the trial of the request for acquittal of the 23 activists politically persecuted for their participation in the demonstrations of 2013 and 2014. The trial began at 1 p.m., lasted about 20 minutes and unanimously approved (3 votes to 0) the acquittal of the activists.
 </p>
<p>
  Outside the court, class movements, entities and democratic associations have gathered to denounce the political persecution and demand the acquittal of the 23 activists pursued by the old state for 10 years. In the act, in addition to being celebrated the result of the trial, speech was also made against the criminalization of the currently ongoing popular struggle, being defended the right of the people to fight for their rights.
 </p>
<p>
  The lawsuit against the 23 political activists began in 2014, with the accusation of “gang formation” and “corruption of minors”. The activists were sentenced on penalties ranging from 5 to 7 years in prison. The accusations and arrests linked to this process are part of the campaign for persecution and criminalization of the popular struggle widely used in 2013 and 2014 to try to contain the survey of the masses that expressed themselves in those years in the great surveys that took the large cities of Brazil, having participation Combatant Youth Special.
 </p>
<p>
  It is worth noting that the criminalization of activists and young people who went to the streets to protest also was attended by the press monopoly, which painted the combatant youth as “terrorists” and “vandals”.
 </p>
<p>
  Due to the repression and persecution against those who took part of the fighting days, several people were arrested or arrested. This is the case of Igor Mendes, who was nearly 7 months after attending a cultural event in Cinelândia on October 15, 2014, breaking, in the understanding of Judge Flávio Itabaiana, the arbitrary and illegal measure that prevented him from participating in events politicians. In addition, several other people had to be clandestinity to escape the waves of arrests that were occurring.
 </p>
<p>
  During these 10 years of fighting the absurd process at 23 activists, people's lawyers were able to fully prove the complete scam behind the accusations, which did not support themselves in evidence but in “testimonies” of infiltrated agents and other illegalities legal that composed a process filled with gross failures.
 </p>
<p>
  The acquittal of the 23 therefore represents a political victory not only for the activists directly affected but also for all the fighters of the people, and especially the fighting youth, who dared to rise up in the heroic days of 2013 and 2014 against the oppression and exploitation of the people.
 </p>
<p>
  The result of today's trial is also important to be in the face of the current national situation, marked by a profound reactionary of the state, which has been creating new laws and legal mechanisms to criminalize popular struggle and the right to manifestation. One is the arrest of several people who participated in demonstrations against the increase in the passage in Sao Paulo, processed and accused of “attempted violent abolition of the Democratic Rule of Law”.

</strong>
</p>
<p>
  The reactionary wave that has engulfed the country since the 1990s continues to grow, leaving the “people of the left” speechless. The absolute domination of a clique of lobbyists over the media leads us to believe that the entire country has sunk into reactionary, anti-Enlightenment and anti-emancipation ideas. The manipulation of History is an old technique of the ruling to try to transform the present in their image.
  <strong>
   Current and past policies inevitably pave the way for fascism and war. We can only be worried about the warlike
  </strong>
<strong>
   tone
  </strong>
<strong>
   s of the “
  </strong>
<strong>
   first of the
  </strong>
<strong>
   citizens” and his henchmen, while tensions between nuclear powers are growing.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  The economic crisis, impoverishment, the march towards war, reactionary and racist policies deserve a clear response from all that this country has of democrats, progressives, humanists, trade unionists, associations, activists,
  <strong>
   all those who think that the emancipation of the human race is not an old thing of the 20th century, but the future of the 21st.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  The history of the workers’ and people’s movement is strewn with armed feats. Our entire social system, our democratic freedoms, are the result of the struggles of the past. The future of the country is only the fruit of today’s struggles and tomorrow. The only guarantor of political and social rights is the people.
 </p>
<p>
  We, citizens, left-wing activists, trade unionists, progressives, humanists, believe that we need historical benchmarks, milestones to be part of a much longer process than the ephemeral tweets of current politicians. We could cite the Great French Revolution, the struggles for the Republic and June 1848, the People’s Front and the Resistance, but of all these dates one particularly serves as an inerasable, temporal mark, because its heart is marked with that of the eternity,
  <strong>
   we want to talk about the Epic of the Commune!
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  It was the first republic of workers in the country and in the world, it abolished the army, separated the State and the Church, gave education for all, new rights to the working class, and it saved the honor of the country sold to the Prussians by the Versailles. The political emancipation of women was the work of the Commune. Real democracy was put in place, with revocability of elected officials at all levels and direct consultation of the people. The Commune was profoundly internationalist, the French citizen was the one who found himself in the universal ideals carried by the Commune.
 </p>
<p>
  The current government is of the same caliber as those from Versailles: republican and democratic in form, ultra-reactionary in substance. Continuing the long work of destroying the public good (public enterprises, social system, education, pensions, health, etc.), he wants to call into question the achievements of the Resistance more than ever.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   To commemorate the Commune is to commemorate the
  </strong>
<strong>
   unreclaimable
  </strong>
<strong>
   , the event which made all the
  </strong>
<strong>
   powerful
  </strong>
<strong>
   of Europe tremble, which resonated throughout the world as a new era, that of the Universal Republic of Workers, that of the emancipation of human
  </strong>
<strong>
   kind
  </strong>
<strong>
   , that of bread and peace.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
   The Commune is not a dead idea, it is a future to be reconquered, an expanding ideal which we must all seize, today, as the antithesis of this Republic which defiles its fundamental principles.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
   Long live the Commune !

Since then, the conditions necessary to prevent famine have not been met and  the latest evidence confirms that Famine is imminent in the northern governorates and projected to occur anytime  between mid-March and May 2024. CURRENT:  15 FEBRUARY - 15 MARCH 2024             2.13M 95% of the population   analysed People facing high   acute food insecurity   (IPC Phase 3 or above) IN NEED OF URGENT  ACTIONPhase 5 677,000 People in Catastrophe Phase 4 876,000 People in Emergency Phase 3 578,000 People in Crisis Phase 2 96,000 People Stressed Phase 1 0 People in food  security PROJECTED:  16 MARCH - 15 JULY 2024             2.23M 100% of the population   analysed People facing high   acute food insecurity   (IPC Phase 3 or above) IN NEED OF URGENT  ACTIONPhase 5 1,107,000 People in Catastrophe Phase 4 854,000 People in Emergency Phase 3 265,000 People in Crisis Phase 2 0 People Stressed Phase 1 0 People in food  security    IPC ACUTE FOOD INSECURITY ANALYSIS   15 FEBRUARY - 15 JULY 2024   Published on 18 March 2024IPC Global Initiative - Special Brief IPC Special Briefs are produced by the IPC global initiative and do not necessarily reflect the views of stakeholders in Palestine. This analysis  factors in all data and information available up to 10 March 2024 and does not take into account the latest developments on the ground. Key Drivers Restricted humanitarian access Extremely limited humanitarian access to and within the  Gaza Strip continues to impede the safe and equitable  delivery of life-saving multi-sector humanitarian assistance  critical for Famine prevention and response. This includes  severe limitations to the supply of goods as well as basic  services.Hostilities Hostilities continue to involve the besiegement of the  entire population and widespread, intense and sustained  ground and air operations and clashes. This has caused  over 31,000 deaths and injured 73,000 people, displaced  about 1.9 million people, damaged or destroyed over half  of the buildings, and devastated assets and infrastructure  indispensable to survival, including across the food, health  and water systems.Current Acute Food Insecurity | 15 February - 15 March  Projected Acute Food Insecurity | 16 March - 15 July<br/><br/> According to the most likely scenario, both North Gaza and Gaza Governorates are classified in IPC Phase 5 (Famine)  with reasonable evidence, with 70% (around 210,000 people) of the population in IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe).   Continued conflict and the near-complete lack of access to the northern governorates for humanitarian organizations  and commercial trucks will likely compound heightened vulnerabilities and extremely limited food availability, access,  and utilization, as well as access to healthcare, water, and sanitation. The famine threshold for household acute food  insecurity has already been far exceeded and, given the latest data showing a steeply increasing trend in cases of acute  malnutrition, it is highly likely that the famine threshold for acute malnutrition has also been exceeded.   In North Gaza,  acute malnutrition (by Mid-Upper Arm Circumference - MUAC) moved from a pre-escalation estimated of 1 percent to 6.8  – 9.1 percent in January and 12.4 to 16.5 percent in February (weighted for children 6-59). Acute malnutrition (by MUAC)  among children 6-23 months old increased in the same period from 16.2 percent to 29.2 percent. The upward trend in  non-trauma mortality is also expected to accelerate, resulting in all famine thresholds likely to be passed imminently.   The southern governorates of Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis, and the Governorate of Rafah, are classified in IPC  Phase 4 (Emergency). However, in a worst-case scenario, these governorates face a risk of Famine through July 2024.  The entire population in the Gaza Strip (2.23 million) is facing high levels of acute food insecurity. From mid-March to  mid-July, in the most likely scenario and under the assumption of an escalation of the conflict including a ground offensive  in Rafah, half of the population of the Gaza Strip (1.11 million people) is expected to face catastrophic conditions (IPC  Phase 5), the most severe level in the IPC Acute Food Insecurity scale. This represents an increase of 530,000 people (92  percent) compared to the previous analysis. Between the current and the projection period, around 400,000 more people  are expected to slide into IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe). The rest of the population faces Emergency (IPC Phase 4) (854,000  people, 38 percent of the population) or Crisis (IPC Phase 3) (265,000 people, 12 percent of the population).  The escalation of the hostilities has caused widespread damage to assets and infrastructure indispensable to survival.  About 50 percent of buildings - and more than 70 percent in the northern governorates - have been damaged or  destroyed. This has included dwellings, shops and infrastructure, such as hospitals, schools, as well as water, sanitation  and other facilities. Assets and infrastructure necessary for food production and distribution have also been destroyed or  severely damaged, extremely limiting the functionality of the food system.  From a pre-escalation average of 500 trucks a day of which 150 carrying food, in the period between 7 October 2023 to  24 February 2024, only 90 trucks per day, of which only 60 carrying food, entered the Gaza Strip. Consequently, virtually  all households are skipping meals every day and adults are reducing their meals so that children can eat. In the northern  governorates, in nearly two thirds of the households, people went entire days and nights without eating at least 10 times  in the last 30 days. In the southern governorates, this applies to one third of the households. <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF3 CURRENT SITUATION MAP AND POPULATION TABLE                                                            (15 February - 15 March 2024 ) Population table for the current situation: 15 February - 15 March 2024 Note: A population in Phase 3+ does not necessarily reflect the full population in need of urgent action. This is because some households may be in Phase 2 or even 1 but only because of receipt of  assistance, and thus, they may be in need of continued action.

At 5,900 residents per square kilometre, one of the  most densely populated areas in the world even before the concentration of most of the population in only one of five  governorates, the Gaza Strip population is extremely reliant on the cross-border movement of goods and utilities like  electricity and water.  In 2022, the Gaza Strip faced an unemployment rate of nearly  45 percent 1 and, by September 2023, the poverty rate was at 60  percent 2, among a population that included nearly 70 percent of  refugees. 3 Due to severely constrained livelihood opportunities,  in 2022, over half of the population was relying on humanitarian  assistance as their main income source and about one-third on  casual labour, 4 with 70 percent of the population food insecure. 5  Conflict . As of 14 March 2024, the ongoing hostilities have  reportedly caused nearly 105,000 casualties within the Gaza Strip  – nearly 5% of the total population. 6 This includes over 73,000  people injured, about half of them women and children, and  over 31,000 deaths. The escalation of hostilities within the Gaza Strip began with  heavy bombardment on 7 October 2023. 7 On 27 October, major  ground operations and clashes reportedly began within the Gaza  Strip. 8 These started in the northern governorates and continued  through 23 November, with a humanitarian pause from 24  November through 30 November. 9 Hostilities subsequently  resumed at high intensity, with major ground operations and  bombardment by air, land, and sea. This included the continued  expansion of a ground operation in Khan Younis Governorate,  centred on Khan Younis city. 10 Another large ground operation began in Deir al-Balah  Governorate on 24 December 2023, 11 expanding across multiple  though not all refugee camps and urban areas in the governorate.  These operations were accompanied by continued clashes  among armed actors. Clashes in the northern governorates, especially some neighbourhoods of Gaza city like Zeitoun,  re-escalated in late February 2024. 12 Bombardment by air, land, and sea of all areas of the Gaza Strip has continued  throughout this period, intensifying particularly before and during major ground operations. Humanitarian access.  Conflict continues to place severe limitations on the ability of humanitarian organizations to deliver  life-saving food, nutrition, health, water, hygiene, sanitation and other life-saving assistance to the besieged population.  Commercial traffic is similarly impeded. Humanitarian access, and the ability of the most vulnerable populations to access  and participate in humanitarian activities safely is highly limited and uneven across the Gaza Strip. Once humanitarian  assistance and commercial goods enter the Gaza Strip, onward access to the northern governorates is extremely limited  and unavailable for extended periods, while access is relatively higher for the southern governorates, particularly Rafah  Governorate. While there has been improvement in access to the Gaza Strip relative to early October 2023, including  the opening of the Kerem Shalom crossing in Mid-December 2023, access to the Gaza Strip continues to fluctuate and  remains insufficient for meeting the basic needs of the overall population.  Severe limitations and attacks on humanitarian staff and assets forced major providers of humanitarian food and other  assistance to the northern governorates to suspend convoys to these areas, including the World Food Programme, on  20 February. 13 Since the previous IPC analysis on the Gaza Strip in December 2023, access denial increased significantly,  especially in the northern governorates. In January 2024, only nine humanitarian missions to the northern governorates  were facilitated, dropping to six missions in February. 14 Figure 1. Casualties in the Gaza Strip reported by the  Palestinian Ministry of Health as of 14 March 2024.  Source: Health Cluster<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF5 According to OCHA, constraints on humanitarian action throughout the Gaza Strip include direct strikes with explosive  weapons on humanitarian convoys, detention of humanitarian staff, road closures, checkpoints, and related blockages  or delays on main transportation corridors. Swarming of humanitarian convoys subsequently increased, including at  several hotspots throughout the Gaza Strip, such as immediately  after crossing Wadi Gaza into the northern governorates.  Physical access constraints further limit the movement of  humanitarian and commercial traffic, including road damage  from bombardment and traffic of heavy military vehicles as well  as the accumulation of an estimated 12,000 metric tons of debris  that may take up to four years to fully clear. 15  Displacement and Movement Restrictions. Displacement  continues to be driven by conflict. An evacuation order was  issued to the entire population residing north of Wadi Gaza  (1.1 million people) on 13 October, 16 followed by orders and  accompanying maps indicating to move as far south as Khan  Younis Governorate. 17 After the humanitarian pause on 24- 30 November 2023, new evacuation orders covering at least   30 percent of the entire Gaza Strip were issued. 18 The unilaterally  declared Al-Mawasi “Humanitarian Zone” was first announced  on 18 October 2023, however, humanitarian agencies did not  agree to the establishment of such zones. 19 The proposed area  has limited pre-existing services, with OCHA reporting there is  “almost no sheltering capacity” . 20  In addition to the closure of some of the main transportation corridors within the Gaza Strip, other movement restrictions  have also been announced, including a ban on movement from southern to northern governorates. 21 Additional  restrictions imposed on populations affect livelihoods and food access, such as a de facto prohibition on fishing and  movement within one kilometre of the border fence, which covers a significant proportion of farmland. 22 The movement  of livestock together with displaced populations has not generally been reported and livestock abandonment is likely  high.Map 1.

Source: Shelter Cluster<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF6 As new evacuation orders are issued alongside with continuation of bombardments  and ground operations, Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) are constantly moving  in search of safety. Most of them have moved south, largely to Rafah Governorate. 23  The population in Rafah has increased about five-fold as a result, rapidly rising from  276,000 pre-escalation to over 1.3 million as of February 2024. A large proportion of  the displaced population is from Gaza and North Gaza Governorates, which have  seen their population decrease by 84 percent and 75 percent respectively. 24 Rafah Governorate, which spans over 65 km 2, now hosts around 1.3 million people. 25  In Rafah, there are 35 UNRWA shelters hosting 882,800 people and another 30  informal shelters hosting 506,300 people, 26 corresponding to over 30 percent of  the population staying in shelters. The formal shelters managed by UNRWA are  overcrowded with severely limited access to safe Water, Sanitation and Hygiene  (WASH) and other services. People in informal shelters face even more difficulties  accessing health, food and non-food services. The lack of Non-food Items (NFIs)  provision in informal settlements has led people to set up makeshift shelters and  tents, which are subject to flooding on rainy days, further exacerbating the suffering  of displaced people. 27  Damages . Destruction and damage of buildings, particularly from bombardment  by air, land, and sea, is evident in all governorates of the Gaza Strip. According to  the recent satellite assessments, by late February 2024, at least 54 percent of all  buildings in the Gaza Strip were likely damaged or destroyed. The largest scale  destruction is in Gaza Governorate where more than 73 percent of buildings are  estimated to be destroyed, followed by North Gaza (70 percent), Deir al-Balah (44  percent), Khan Younis (52 percent) and Rafah (28 percent). 28 This has included  dwellings, shops and various types of infrastructure, such as hospitals, schools, and  other public buildings, as well as WASH infrastructure and storage facilities, among  others.  Food Availability Production . The escalation of hostilities and mass  displacements have caused food shortages and  unavailability throughout the Gaza Strip as the food system  and agriculture value chains have collapsed or are marginally  surviving through the informal market. A significant portion  of agriculture land, encompassing orchards, greenhouses,  and farmlands has suffered extensive destruction. According  to the UNOSAT, the percent of damaged agriculture land  has increased from 25 percent to 60 percent, between  November 2023 and January 2024.29  Extensive damage has been inflicted on the local food  system, including agricultural infrastructure. More than 300  home barns, 100 agricultural warehouses, 46 farm storages,  119 animal shelters, 200 farms, as well over 600 wells used for  irrigation have been destroyed, amongst other agriculture  facilities.30 According to the FAO damage assessment of  February 2024, damage to wells was found to be most  concentrated in the North Gaza and Gaza Governorates; and  in some areas, all the wells were damaged. Additionally, over  26 percent (336) of all greenhouses have been damaged  across all governorates. The governorates with the highest Map 3. Gaza Damage Mapping  26.02.2024.

Source: UNOSAT, 2023-2024<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF7 damage are Gaza (55 percent), North Gaza (48 percent), Khan Younis (35 percent), Deir al-Balah (20 percent) and Rafah  (16 percent). The Governorate of Khan Younis had the largest area of damaged greenhouses (149 hectares), followed by  Rafah (89 hectares). More than 40 percent (6,694 ha) of all croplands has been damaged since 7 October, with the highest reported damages  in Gaza (55 percent, 1,941 ha), Deir al-Balah (51 percent, 1,408 ha), North Gaza (45 percent, 1,402 ha), Khan Younis (33  percent, 1,492 ha) and Rafah (25 percent, 451 ha) Governorates. In terms of cropland type, 41 percent of irrigated land, 43 percent of orchards and 42 percent of rainfed land have been  damaged.31 The hostilities have not only led to the destruction of agricultural assets and infrastructure, they also resulted  in the displacement of populations away from agricultural land and constrained access for agricultural activities. Other assets and infrastructure necessary for food production and distribution have also been destroyed or severely  damaged, extremely limited the functionality of the food system. Although some local production, primarily of vegetables, is still ongoing, it is very  limited. Lack of access to land and destruction of crops are compounded by a lack of  access to essential agriculture inputs (fuel, seeds, fertilizers, pesticides).  Most livestock were abandoned during the large-scale displacement in October 2023.  Remaining livestock are being slaughtered or sold due to the lack of fodder and water  or due to the need for cash or other resources. Similarly, poultry lack animal feed, and  the availability of poultry meat and eggs is reduced throughout the Gaza Strip.  The comparison among the preliminary reports from the FAO Loss and Damage  assessment and the baseline figure from the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics  (PCBS), shows about 70 percent of livestock and other animals have been lost since 7  October 2024. Fishing production is largely halted due to the damage of boats, lack  of fuel and security/safe access. Some fishing is still happening, but it is only available  to those who still possess equipment and have access to fuel.  Food security assessments indicate32 that, due to the lack of food availability, some  households are resorting to eating wild foods. These range from mallow ( khebbayze  in Arabic) to unconventional food sources such as animal fodder and other unsafe  foods. Figure 2. Overview of the damage to agricultural land and infrastructure due to the conflict in the Gaza Strip as of 15 February  2024. Source: FAO<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF8 Imports . Between January and September 2023, a daily average of 150 food trucks entered the Gaza Strip. Between  8 October 2023 and 9 March 2024, this number decreased to an average of 65 trucks per day33 and the availability of  food commodities has dramatically declined. Since the escalation of the hostilities, the number of trucks allowed into  the Gaza Strip has been severely restricted, reducing the inflow of humanitarian assistance and preventing the entry of  commercial goods completely until 8 December 2023. Since then, there was an initial increase in the flow of food and  non-food commodities, facilitated through the opening of a second border crossing (Kerem Shalom).  However, in February, the flow of commodities decreased again and has been intermittent from late January through  February. The month of February in particular saw major variations highlighted in figure 3. The entry of humanitarian and commercial trucks into Gaza is significantly limited to the southern governorates, mainly  Rafah. Conversely, there are very few items reaching the northern governorates and other areas in the rest of the south of  Gaza Strip.34 OCHA estimates that less than 5 percent  of all the food trucks have reached North Gaza and  Gaza Governorates in the past four weeks, while 45  percent remained in Rafah and about 50 percent  reached Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis. An in-depth  analysis of the border crossing manifest allowed to  generate approximate kilocalories values per truck  and per unit of analysis then distributed per area,  using information provided by OCHA and the Food  Security Sector. This reveals that in most days, the  quantity of food translated in kilocalories entering  in Gaza has been extremely below the requirements  in North Gaza Governorates, and mostly half the  requirements in Rafah. The only areas appearing to  have benefited from an almost sufficient amount  of kilocalories (although irregular) are in Khan  Younis and Deir al-Balah Governorates (with higher  quantities in the later). This may suggest that most Figure 3. Reanalysis of food-only trucks entering Gaza through Kerem Shalom and Rafah border crossing. Source: UNRWA Figure 4. Reanalysis of the Kcal availability per unit of analysis.  Source: UNRWA, Gaza Supply and Dispatch  <br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF9 requirements in Rafah. Based on truck entries into the Gaza Strip from 21 October 2023 to 3 March 2024, the proportion of  average kilocalories per day (using a 7-day rolling average) has been consistently below the daily kilocalorie requirements  (calculated using demographic data considering variations by age and gender), with the exception of a short period of  time around mid-January.  A survey conducted by the World Food Programme (WFP)35 highlights that interviewed shop owners are faced with a  significant shortage of basic food items, with 81 percent indicating depletion. Furthermore, 19 percent highlighted that  the available food items are in short supply, and not expected to last more than a week. The formal market has been  heavily impacted with a non-functioning supply chain, and severely damaged shops. Consequently, the informal market  has surged. Informal markets, provide 1 or 2 types of foods (canned foods mainly), and are supplied by the beneficiaries  of assistance (selling or bartering). The WFP market monitoring indicates that most respondents have stocks inferior to 1  week or inexistent for the vast majority of the food commodities, with the exception of vegetables. All respondents have  exhausted dairy products.36 Despite the presence of at least a hundred bakeries in northern Gaza, few are able to operate due to significant challenges.  The main obstacle is the persistent shortage of flour, other bakery inputs, and fuel. In early January, WFP began supporting  12 bakeries in Rafah and Deir al-Balah.37 Access Market functionality. Informal markets now dominate both food and non-food item transactions across the Gaza Strip as  formal markets have collapsed following the depletion of stocks and damage to primary places of business. Selling and  buying is mostly taking place in the street along with potential barter activities. People, and more particularly vulnerable  groups, are increasingly facing protection risks to access markets with the lack of social order and high levels of food  insecurity. There is a risk associated to transporting and carrying food in the street, especially in Northern Gaza and  Gaza Governorates where people have resorted to going out in groups to buy food and/or carrying knives to protect  themselves. The scarcity of items is driving food prices up and reducing household purchasing power. The overall Consumer Price  index (CPI) was approximately 49 percent higher in December 2023 compared to the onset of the conflict; the CPI for  food and soft drinks was 76 percent higher.38  Food aid.  The flow of humanitarian assistance into and across the Gaza Strip continues to be severely disrupted. Between  1 January and 12 February 2024, 51 percent of aid missions planned for the north of Wadi Gaza and 25 percent of  those planned for the areas requiring coordination south of Wadi Gaza were denied access..39 In February, the UN and its  humanitarian partners planned only 24 missions to areas north of Gaza, of which six (25 percent) were facilitated. This  stands in stark contrast to January, when 61 missions were planned to the north, with nine (15 percent) facilitated.40Figure 5. Stocks availability at shops as of 21 January (% of respondents). Source: WFP<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF10 Based on data from UNRWA,41 the maximum number of trucks entering daily from both the Kerem Shalom and the Rafah  crossings was 300 (compared to an average of 500 daily pre-escalation), approximately 70 percent of these trucks carried  food or a mixture of food and non-food items. On 20 February 2024, WFP decided to suspend its food aid deliveries to  northern Gaza as a result of chaos and violence.42 On 5 March, a 14-truck food convoy, the first by WFP to the north since  it paused deliveries on 20 February, was denied access after a three-hour wait at the Wadi Gaza checkpoint and then  looted on its way back.43  On 7 March, 11 food trucks from private sector were allowed to enter. In total, from 5 February to 5 March, 10-15 food  trucks were allowed into the Gaza Governorate to feed about 300,000 people (less than 1 Kg per person for a full month).  Given the spread of the conflict, restrictions on movement and the displacement of the population, the humanitarian  space is constantly decreasing, and humanitarian food assistance is being distributed unequally among areas.  Airdrop operations of food aid along the Gaza Strip coastline began on 26 February 2024. Airdrops mainly consist of  ready-made meals that do not require cooking methods and are of high nutritional value. However, they are erratic,  small-scale, cover a limited geographic area, and are primarily accessible to populations located near the coast, including  those physically able to recover food pallets and packages from the sea in a context of heightened civil unrest. Airdrops  without ground coordination are also dangerous and falling assistance may strike civilians, as occurred on 8 March when Figure 6. Food CPI in Gaza Strip (December 2022 - December 2023). Source: WFP/ PCBS Figure 7. Inflation rate (September 2023 vs. December 2023). Source: WFP/ PCBS<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF11 OCHA reported that five civilians died.44 In  light of this, airdrops account for a negligible  share of the humanitarian food security  assistance in the Gaza Strip compared to  what is trucked in overland. Cash Assistance.  The functionality of cash  assistance in the Gaza Strip is limited. As of  15 February 2024, cash actors had delivered  emergency multi-purpose cash assistance  to over 125,000 households (over 828,000  people) since the onset of the conflict.45  According to the most recent Cash Post  Distribution Monitoring,46 about 71 percent  of the respondents reported that the cash  assistance received helped them to either  access urgent/basic items and services  needed. Most expenditures were on food (89 percent), followed by medicines, debt repayment, water and hygiene  products, and transportation. In Rafah, cash liquidity is a significant challenge47 because of the high number of displaced  individuals and the logistical difficulties banks face in transferring cash. Poor electricity supply and connectivity are also  affecting the ability of financial service providers to make cash accessible.   Figure 8. Planned aid missions by month. Source: OCHA  Figure 9a.

Source: UNRWAUtilization  Before the escalation of hostilities, electricity was unreliable and only available for a few hours each day. The lack of  electricity negatively affected all aspects of life, including food safety, and made it almost impossible to operate food  processing units effectively.48 The main water and electricity networks, fuel and food supplies are now almost completely  suspended.49 Frequent communication blackouts make it extremely challenging to coordinate the distribution of aid,  and let people know how to access it, and when.  The complete electricity blackout that began on 11 October 2023 continues, with only limited electricity generated  inside the Gaza Strip from generators and solar panels. Hostilities in the Gaza Strip continue to prevent the delivery of fuel  to the Gaza power plant, which remains non-functioning, and block cross-border electricity distribution.50 This severely  impacts all aspects of daily life, including the processing and storage of food, pumping and distribution of drinking water,  treatment of wastewater, and the functionality of telecommunications and financial systems. <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF13 The lack of electricity and damage to telecommunication systems has also limited the ability of populations to  communicate and access information like evacuation orders or humanitarian assistance delivery. There have been rolling  telecommunication blackouts since 7 October, with several lasting around one week.51 Fuel was not permitted to enter the Gaza Strip from 7 October until 15 November 2023. UNRWA reported that for only  the bare minimum of critical services in which it is involved, 160,000 litres per day of diesel fuel are needed. This minimum  requirement, which is still insufficient for a full restoration of humanitarian operations and other basic services, has been  met only about 10 percent of days from 7 October through 9 March. No fuel was permitted to enter the Gaza Strip from  20 December 2023 through 7 January 2024, a period of new or expanding major ground operations, including in Deir  al-Balah and Khan Younis Governorates. From 24 January through 6 March, fuel was permitted to enter the Gaza Strip  only on alternative days.52 Even once inside the Gaza Strip, the onward movement of diesel fuel faces the same extreme  challenges as other humanitarian and commercial goods, with little fuel reaching the northern governorates. Regarding fuel to North Wadi Gaza, two (10 percent) of 21 planned missions were facilitated. Both deliveries were  facilitated to a single hospital, leaving other hospitals and WASH facilities without fuel. For fuel to areas South of Wadi  Gaza, 15 (71 percent) of 21 planned missions to areas requiring coordination were facilitated. A total of 300,600 litres were  delivered. However, convoys to Nasser hospital were denied access five times in a row. Fuel shortages in hospitals force  them to cease most operations and may lead to preventable deaths.53 About 250 tons of cooking gas entered the Gaza Strip per day on average from January to August 2023.54 Daily entry into  the Gaza Strip from 24 November 2023 through 10 March 2024 has consistently been roughly 30-40 percent of that pre- escalation amount.55 This has further challenged the ability of the Gaza Strip population to cook food that they are able  to access, presenting challenges to physical and biological utilization. As of January-February 2024, nearly 80 percent of  the population in all governorates reported using firewood as their primary cooking fuel, covering any form of wood  available. Around 10-15 percent of the population across governorates reported burning waste as their main cooking  fuel, while almost no respondents reported using cooking gas. Between 7 and 10 percent of respondents reported  that there was no cooking fuel available.56 This is a particular concern as these populations face major challenges with  consuming food that they may still have access to, in particular flour.  Stability Continued conflict and worsening acute food insecurity and nutritional status also contribute to civil unrest, which  further lowers the stability of all food security dimensions. Civil unrest is a major challenge to the delivery of humanitarian  assistance and to humanitarian staff, and hampers their ability to reach the people in need as well as for the most  vulnerable to access and make full use of assistance.  Recent deaths related to the airdrops and swarming of the trucks entering the Gaza Strip are key evidence of the level  of desperation and acute hunger among the people of Gaza. These also show that even a minimal degree of order to  facilitate access to food and other essential supplies, such as medicines, cannot be guaranteed, given the absence of  civil authorities or organized police. Social cohesion in Gaza is strained, exposing the most vulnerable, such as children  - particularly those who are unaccompanied, women, the elderly, the chronically ill and people living with disabilities to  extreme levels of food and water deprivation.   Food Security Outcomes The most recent WFP survey relied on data collected through Computer Assisted Telephone Interviews (CATI) between  6 December 2023 and 19 February 2024. The number of observations were: For North Gaza and Gaza Governorates: 104  observations; for Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah Governorates: 369 observations; for Rafah Governorate: 892 observations.  Households were randomly selected from a master list of 320,000 WFP pre-conflict beneficiary households representing  80 percent of the total pre-conflict population in the Gaza Strip. Overall, 10,320 households were selected and called.  Of them, 1,365 respondents completed the questionnaires (success rate of 13.3 percent - in line with the 10 percent  to 20 percent typical of CATI analyses in the region), while 19 (0.2 percent) answered the call but hung-up and did not  complete it. The rest did not answer.57<br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF14 Food Consumption Score (FCS). According to the survey, most households across the Gaza Strip have inadequate food  consumption with almost 88 percent of households in the North reporting Poor Food consumption (indicative of IPC  Phase 4 and 5, Emergency and Catastrophe) and 9 percent reporting Borderline food consumption (indicative of IPC  Phase 3, Crisis). An additional disaggregation of the FCS ‘poor’ category (&lt;14) shows that in the North Gaza Governorates,  36 percent of the respondents are not even able to eat cereals daily. In Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah around 53 percent of  households reported poor consumption and 31 percent reported borderline consumption, among them 11 percent had  a value below 14. In Rafah, around 48 percent of households reported poor food consumption and 31 percent reported  borderline consumption of which 5 percent had a value below 14.58 Across all governorates, the food consumption  gaps are clear as most households are unable to consume cereals daily. In the north, the mean number of days of cereal  consumption is 4.4 per week, in Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah Governorates and Rafah Governorate the mean number  of days is 5.14 and 5.15, respectively. Consumption of protein rich food is extremely low in Northern Gaza at 0.33 days a  week and a little over one day a week in the rest of the Gaza Strip.  Reduced Coping Strategy Index (rCSI). Results from reduced coping strategies index indicates that nearly 100 percent of  respondents in the Gaza Strip are engaging in extreme coping strategies. The indicator assesses the frequency with which  households resorted to coping strategies that altered their consumption patterns such as reducing meals, restricting  consumption by adults for children to eat, and borrowing food, in the previous week to cover gaps in their consumption.  Household Hunger Scale (HHS). An increase in the proportion of households facing extreme food consumptions gaps is  observed across all analysed governorates when compared with November 2023 data. About 84 percent of households  in Northern Gaza (Gaza and North Gaza) experienced ‘very severe hunger’ , indicative of IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe), while  8 percent of households reported ‘severe hunger’ , indicative of IPC Phase 4 (Emergency). Compared with the previous  survey round, the deterioration has been significant. In November the proportion of households with ‘very severe hunger’  was estimated at 40 percent showing a doubling of households facing extreme food consumption gaps indicative of IPC  Phase 5 (Catastrophe). In Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis Governorates, 57 percent of households reported experiencing  ‘very severe hunger’ , while 24 percent reported to experience ‘severe hunger’ , compared with November 2023 when only  22 percent of households faced ‘very severe hunger’ . In Rafah, the proportion households reportedly experiencing ‘very  severe hunger’ was 56 percent and 21 percent reporting ‘severe hunger’ .59 Livelihood coping. Some indirect evidence on livelihood coping mechanisms was collected focusing on emergency  strategies contextualised for the very specific conditions of Gaza. The data indicates the highest use of extreme coping  strategies in the North with 18 percent of households reporting that they bartered/exchanged clothing for food, while  12 percent reported begging for food. As estimated 3 percent reported scavenging due to lack of food, and 18 percent  reported gathering wild foods. Around 23 percent reported looting food from debris, and 74 percent indicated that  they sought food outside their shelter, facing potential security risks. In Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis, the reported  proportions were similar: 24 percent of households reported that they bartered/exchanged clothing for food, and in  Rafah the proportion was 27 percent. Around 7 percent in Khan Younis, Deir al-Balah and Rafah Governorates reported  begging for food. An estimated 1.8 percent reported scavenging due to lack of food and 15 percent gathering wild foods.  Around 5 percent in Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah Governorates, and 6 percent in Rafah Governorate reported looting  food from debris. Finally, 65 percent of the households in Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis Governorates, and 59 percent in  Rafah Governorate reported that they sought food outside their shelter facing potential security risks. The survey detected  a high level of non-applicable strategies, which might indicate the pure exhaustion of these coping mechanisms.  Household Economy Approach (HEA) Outcome Analysis (OA): Preliminary HEA Outcome Analysis was made available  by FEWS NET for this IPC analysis. For the northern governorates (North Gaza and Gaza urban area), for the period of  February – August 2024, all the wealth groups categories living in these governorates are expected to face high level of  Survival Deficits (SD), indicative of an IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe). The SD is calculated compared to a survival threshold  defined as the amount of food and cash income needed by the households to meet the 2,100 Kcal per day per person. This  also include the cost of preparing and consuming food plus any cash expenditure on water for human consumption.60  The only exception in these results appear for the Better Off (BO) wealth group living in the Semi Agriculture Gaza (SAG)  livelihood zone with livelihoods more related to crops sales, livestock sales or self-employment, that will experience SD  Indicative of an IPC Phase 4 (Emergency), at the limit of an IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe). For Southern Gaza, the level of  deficit for the projected period of April – August 2024 for the households living in urban areas (URB livelihood zone), will  be indicative of an IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe). For the households living in this governorate with livelihoods more related  to agricultural labour, crop and livestock sales or self-employment, (SAG livelihood zone) – that represent a small portion  of the population living in this governorate -, the Very Poor and the Poor wealth groups will face SD indicative of an IPC <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF15 Figure 11.

This last  deficit is calculated compared to a Livelihood Protection basket that include all the sources of food and income needed  for the households to maintain their local livelihoods.  Gender lens.  Food insecurity has a multidimensional impact on women, as it not only relates to unequal access to,  distribution of, consumption of, and control over food, but it also has long-term health and safety risks.  UN Women data  shows that the escalation in food insecurity has also increased the vulnerability of women to food insecurity. More than  4 out of 5 women (84 percent) interviewed by UN Women report that their family eats half or less of the food they used  to before the conflict  began, with mothers and adult women being those tasked with sourcing food, yet eating last,  less, and least than everyone else. Moreover, 4 in 5 women (84 percent) in Gaza indicate that at least one of their family  members had to skip meals during the past week. In 95 percent of those cases, mothers are the ones going without food,  skipping at least one meal to feed their children. Nearly 9 in 10 women (87 percent) report finding it harder to access food  than men.

Among the main food groups reported, breastmilk was  mentioned for 39 children (83 percent), and eggs for 17 (36 percent). The consumption of all the other food groups,  such as legumes, vitamin A rich fruits and vegetables, other vegetables, grains, meat and dairy products, had almost  completely disappeared from their daily diet, indicating an extremely worrying situation in terms of diet quality. 95  percent of the pregnant and breastfeeding women had consumed two or fewer food groups the previous day. The  main food groups mentioned were non-vitamin A rich vegetables, grains and eggs. This situation highlights critically  insufficient micronutrient intake before and during pregnancy and breastfeeding, which can affect both women and the  development of their infants.  In Khan Younis, 90 percent of young children and pregnant and breastfeeding women consumed two food groups or  fewer in the last 24 hours. For young children, the food groups most frequently mentioned were breastmilk and eggs,  while grains, pulses and eggs were the food groups most frequently mentioned for pregnant and breastfeeding women.  In Deir al-Balah, 86 percent of young children had eaten two or fewer food groups during the day before the survey, while  only 3 percent had consumed five food groups. The food groups most consumed were breastmilk, followed by eggs and  grains. Among pregnant and breastfeeding women, 67 percent consumed only one food group the day preceding the  survey, while 26 percent consumed two food groups. Pulses, grains and other vegetables were the food groups most  frequently mentioned by respondents.  In Rafah, 88 percent (UNICEF) – 89 percent (CATI) of young children had consumed two or fewer food groups within the  past 24 hours, breastmilk, eggs and grains were the main food groups consumed by young children. Only 3 percent had  eaten more than two food groups in the last 24 hours.  Infant and young child feeding practices Neonates face deteriorating nutritional status if mothers are unable to breastfeed due to stress, poor mental health and/ or inadequate breastfeeding privacy, and lack of counselling and support by healthcare providers.62 Further, the high pre- conflict prevalence of formula use among Gazans (58 percent among under six-month-old infants) raises concerns with  regards to potential supply disruptions. Under poor WASH conditions, keeping formula water, teats, and bottles sterile  is very challenging. These disruptions can result in increased incidence of diarrhoea and other infectious diseases, both  of which further exacerbate malnutrition. The prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding is projected to average between 25  percent to 35 percent under a ceasefire scenario (lower than the pre-conflict baseline of 42 percent, reflecting ongoing  disruptions including overcrowding and worsened mental health), falling to 20 percent to 30 percent under a status quo  scenario and 5 percent to 15 percent under the escalation scenario. These disruptions have enduring consequences on  infant and child health. Based on interviews that WFP conducted with eight key informants (four interviews were held  on 11 January, and the remaining interviews were conducted on 22-23 January), widespread weight loss, diseases, and  malnutrition prevail due to insufficient food supplies, intensifying the health crisis in the Gaza Strip.63  Health There are now only four hospitals and two clinics remaining in Gaza Governorate and two hospitals and two clinics in  North Gaza. All of them operate at a very low level and information on the health status of children under five is close to  absent. The survey conducted did not reach a minimum sample allowing exploitation of the information.  In Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah Governorates, according to the Nutrition Vulnerability and Situation Analysis, more  than 97 percent of children under five reported having had one or more diseases in the past two weeks. 56 percent  of the children under five had experienced Acute Respiratory Infections within the past two weeks, 70.5 percent had  experienced diarrhoea, and 82.3 percent had had a fever. This shows the extremely critical health conditions children  face, exposing them to high-risk nutritional deterioration. Trends from WHO corroborate these findings, showing a 55  percent increase in diarrhoea cases in children under five between November-December 2023. While the three hospitals  in the Governorate of Deir al-Balah were still operational in late November, nine of the 16 Primary Health Care Centres  (PHCCs) were no longer functioning, seriously impeding access to health services. On average, 0.49 litres of drinking water <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF18 was available per person per day in the households surveyed, which is far from the minimum humanitarian standard (2L/ person/day).35 The scale of needs is staggering with 100 percent of the 49 households in need of food and hygiene items,  78 percent in need of water, 69 percent shelter, and 65 percent health assistance.  In Rafah, the Nutrition Vulnerability and Situation Analysis also shows extreme health conditions with almost 93 percent  of children under five having one or more disease within the past two weeks, 79 percent had had a fever and 56 percent  had experienced vomiting. The level of diarrhoea is extremely critical with 70 percent of children under five having had  one episode in the past two weeks, and almost 60 percent having ARI (Acute Respiratory Infection).64  Since mid-October, 388,200 cases of acute respiratory infections have been recorded, along with 246,000 cases of diarrhea  and 3,300 cases of bloody diarrhea, 84,000 cases of skin rashes, 12,000 cases of Acute Jaundice (including confirmed  Hepatitis A).65 As per OCHA, 1.9 million IDPs face at high risk of communicable disease due overcrowding of IDP sites and  lack of access to proper water sanitation and hygiene facilities.66 In Gaza, cases of Hepatitis A have been confirmed in  January 2024 and WHO warned that inhumane living conditions will enable Hepatitis A to continue to spread.67  Health system functionality.  In February 2024, attacks against healthcare facilities, infrastructure and services continued  resulting in 58 percent of the hospitals are not functioning in the Gaza Strip, especially in the northern governorates  (75 percent of the hospitals not functioning). According to the Health Cluster, as of 5 March 2024, only 2 hospitals and  no Primary Health Care Centres were fully functioning; 14 hospitals and 20 Primary Health Care Centres were partially  functioning; while 23 hospitals and 62 Primary Health Centres were not functioning. Only 141 medical points in shelters  were available, while 264 informal, public and UNRWA shelters did not have a medical centre available.68 In the northern governorates, hospitals have been offering limited maternity, trauma, surgery and emergency care services.  They also face challenges such as a shortage of medical staff, including specialized surgeons, neurosurgeons, and intensive  care staff, as well as a lack of medical supplies, and have an urgent need for fuel, food, and drinking water.69 In Deir al-Balah  and Khan Younis, according to OCHA, since January 2024, three hospitals – Al Aqsa, Nasser, and Gaza European – were at  risk of closure due to the issuance of evacuation orders in adjacent areas and the ongoing conduct of hostilities nearby. In  Rafah, 5 hospitals are still functioning. The influx of IDPs migrating to Rafah has overwhelmed the bed availability in hospitals,  leading to insufficient capacity to meet the healthcare needs of the population. There is also high need for primary health  services in informal shelters hosting IDPs. The continued besiegement around some hospitals is significantly affecting their  case management capacity. Referring patients outside of Gaza remains a challenge, as the waiting list continues to grow.70 In addition, people are unable to effectively access healthcare due to the lack of laboratory equipment and reagents  needed for accurate diagnosis and testing.71 The risk to public health is intensified due to an acute scarcity of hygiene  materials and adequate sanitation infrastructure. Persistent anecdotal reports of Hepatitis A cases in Gaza, as recorded  by UNRWA and the Health Cluster, highlight ongoing concerns. Limited access to proper WASH facilities is hindering  prevention of diseases. The high number of surgeries and procedures has led to increased demand for anaesthetic and  analgesic medications which are in short supply. Blood and blood products in hospitals are needed for emergencies and  medical procedures to ensure that patients receive timely transfusions.72  Figure 1. Gaza disease surveillance Source: WHO, Health Cluster<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF19 UNRWA stocks of medicines continue to decrease, with around 15 days’ supply remaining overall and one week’s supply  of insulin; some items may run out sooner based on needs at shelters. Therefore, there is an urgent need to restock  medical supplies given the depletion of stocks in the local market. Stocks of fuel and medicines continue to be at risk  of depletion halting UNRWA operations at the health centres. Essential medicines and other critical medical supplies  remain difficult to bring into the Gaza Strip due to strict control of allegedly dual-use items at border crossings and wider  challenges with importing controlled drugs. As basic and specialty healthcare services in Gaza continue to deteriorate,  an increase in excess deaths due to traumatic injuries that would otherwise be survivable with timely and appropriate  care is expected.   In December 2023, UNICEF delivered 962,550 doses of essential vaccines, including for measles, pneumonia, and polio.  Opening of stabilization centres for acute malnutrition cases with medical complications are also planned notably in Tal  as Sultan (Rafah) and another in one of the field hospitals.73 Heightened insecurity and limited access to health facilities  continue to present major challenges for partners to respond and partner operations continue to be negatively affected  by the displacement of staff, social stresses and telecommunication challenges.74   Water, sanitation, and hygiene  Prior to the escalation of hostilities, the majority of the water supply in the Gaza Strip came from groundwater sources  and the rest (around 20 percent) from desalination plants and cross border pipelines. The over pumping of groundwater  in Palestine led to severe water pollution and salinization, especially in the Gaza Strip. More than 97 percent of the water  pumped from the coastal aquifer in the Gaza Strip did not meet the water quality standards set by WHO (PCBS and PWA,  2021).75 Figure 13.

Source: WASH Cluster<br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF20 Nitrate levels already exceeded 150 mg/litre  in most areas of the Gaza Strip, which made  the water undrinkable, given the World Health  Organization (WHO) acceptable limit of 50  mg/litre.  In 2019, the daily allocation of water  per capita for domestic purposes was 77 litres/  capita in the Gaza Strip.77 Taking the high  percentage of water pollution in the Gaza Strip  and calculating the quantity of water suitable  for human use, the per capita share of fresh  water was 22.4 litres per day.78 Damage to WASH facilities.  Based on satellite  damage assessments on WASH infrastructure  dated 21 February,79 13 percent of all sewage  and water facilities have been destroyed (7  percent and 14 percent respectively), while  in total over 56 percent have been either  destroyed or damaged (13 percent and 34  percent respectively). Another 11 percent are  assessed to have possible damage. Overall, this  assessment identifies 77 facilities destroyed  and 254 facilities damaged, with another 67  facilities with possible damage. Northern  Gaza and Gaza Governorates have the highest  concentration of reported damaged or  destroyed infrastructure.  The functionality of, or access to, the 194  facilities (38 and 156 respectively) that were  found with no visible damage is conditional  to access to fuel and spare parts, which are  in very limited supply, as well as availability  of technicians and access to areas with  these assets. The combined damaged and  conditional access to the remaining WASH  infrastructure is expected to have a profound  impact on the availability of water, water  quality and presence of unsafe water or contaminants for populations in these areas. Water availability and drinking water. Water availability continues to be a major concern across the Gaza Strip. In  February 2024, the water produced from all the water sources in Gaza accounted for only 5.7 percent of the pre-escalation  production levels.80 According to OCHA, only 17 percent of the 284 groundwater wells are operating with limited hours  and 39 wells have been reported as destroyed and 93 as moderately to severely damaged.81 Still according to OCHA,  only one of the three cross border water pipelines is operating, functioning at 47 percent of its capacity. Plans to repair  the non-functioning pipelines face challenges in terms of access, communication, or repair coordination considering the  current context. The United Arab Emirate’s small desalination plant located on the Egyptian side of Rafah, operates at full  capacity, providing 2,400 cubic metres per day, following the construction of a 3-kilometre transmission line. In addition,  only two out of the three main water desalination plants are partially functional, mainly in the southern governorates.82   Water quality appears low due to lack of processing facilities or other way of contamination.  According to another study (sample size of 1,200 people)83 conducted in the Gaza Strip in February 2024, access to water  for drinking, bathing and cleaning, is estimated at 1.5 litre per person per day compared to the 15 litres minimum amount  of water required for survival as per as the international SPHERE standards. Similar results from the WASH cluster rapid  assessment conducted in 41 sites indicate a median value of 2 litres per person per day.84 Water production and distribution is a fuel intensive process and the overall WASH fuel allocation is currently 30,000 litres  per day. From 24 January through 4 March, the WASH sector in the Gaza Strip accounted for 30 percent to 60 percent Map 5. WASH facilities damaged, February 2024. Source: WASH Cluster<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF21 of all fuel entering the Gaza Strip, with limitations on diesel fuel entry a major impediment to meeting minimum water  requirements throughout the Gaza Strip, especially in the northern governorates.85 In the northern governorates, water supply remains limited and no access to clean water has been reported.86 According  to OCHA, as of 12 January 2024, the combination of water trucking, water from the functional desalination plant, and the  restoration of one of the three main water supply lines on 30 December 2023, has yielded only seven percent of water  production in Gaza, compared with the pre-October 2023 supply.87 In Rafah Governorate, according to the WASH cluster rapid assessment, the majority of the sites rely mainly on water  trucking and piped water in scattered sites, and collective centres rely more heavily on wells.88 More than half of the  sites provide water that is unsafe for drinking (67 percent in collective centres) and only 12 percent can provide water  treatment at source. According to the Euromed study, in Rafah Governorate out of the 15 litres minimum amount of  water a day required as per sphere standard, only 8 litres are available on average across sites (3 litres in collective centres),  with a median of 2 litres per person per day, indicating high level of disparities among sites. Hygiene.  According to the WASH cluster, in Rafah, 61 percent of the sites in collective centres and 71 percent in scattered  sites have no shower89 and the average number of showers per person is about 3,500 in collective centres and 1,050 in  scattered sites. Access and protection of most vulnerable population is also of high concern, with only 12 percent of the  showers being accessible for people living with disabilities and only 24 percent of the sites having separated showers for  women (14 percent in collective centres).  Figure 15. Quantity and type of water sources per site. Source: WASH cluster<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF22 An NRC assessment90 conducted in nine shelters in Rafah also stated that every assessed location had reported cases of  “hepatitis A, gastroenteritis, diarrhoea, smallpox, lice, [and] influenza.”  Solid Waste Management. In terms of waste management, most of the wastewater treatment systems have been  suspended and non-functioning since November 2023, due to damage, lack of fuel/power supply, and lack of  maintenance.91 Regarding solid-waste management, which was already a crucial issue before the escalation, the last  UNRWA update on 16 January states that solid waste management continues in Rafah and Khan Younis Governorates  and partially in Deir al-Balah Governorate, where approximately 45 truck loadings were transferred to temporary sites.92  However, according to the WASH cluster,93 93 percent of the sites (89 percent in collective centres and 100 percent in  scattered sites) have some type of visible waste, mainly solid waste or trash and 68 percent of all the sites present informal  or uncontrolled dumping areas. The accumulation of tens of thousands of tons of solid waste on the streets, around  hospitals, IDP shelters, and various random dump sites, represent high public health risks. The Gaza Municipality also  estimates that approximately 50,000 tons of solid waste remain unmanaged.94Figure 16. Quantity and type of water sources per site. Source: WASH cluster Figure 17. Waste management. Source: WASH Cluster<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF23 Sanitation. Sanitation situation continues to deteriorate and remains a major issue in all governorates. Despite significant  efforts by UNICEF and its partners to construct family latrines, sanitation coverage remains very low and efforts to increase  coverage are hindered by a lack of cement and other construction materials, including due to constraints on the entry of  items considered to be dual use into the Gaza Strip.95  With wastewater treatment plants non-functioning and many sewage facilities destroyed, especially in Gaza city, flooding  has been a major health hazard through the rainy period as floodwater mixes with untreated sewage in urban areas with  dense displaced populations.96 This is further compounded by the enduring fuel shortage, which impedes the operation  of remaining sewage stations and wastewater treatment plants. According to the WASH Cluster, there is also an increasing  concern about the potential for additional flooding of already contaminated rainwater harvesting lagoons, particularly if  rainfall intensifies. This situation poses a critical threat to both the environment and public health.97 In early 2023, UNICEF  reported that “insufficient safely managed water supply to households, poor sanitation, limited public WASH services, and  risk of flooding expose 1.36 million Palestinians to water-related diseases risks” .98 The situation is exacerbated by continuous restricted access to essential sanitation supplies and services in Gaza.99 The  inability to transport sufficient fuel into the Gaza Strip, and especially to the northern governorates, also significantly  compounds the challenges faced by the WASH response.100  A rapid assessment of displacement sites, including scattered sites and collective centres, in Rafah Governorate was  conducted by the WASH cluster in February 2024.101 63 percent of assessed sites reportedly had access to a sewer  connection (78 percent in collective centres and 36 percent in scattered sites). Few sites reported using buckets/plastic  bags, flush to open drain, septic tank, or flush to elsewhere as a sanitation facility. The median number of persons per  toilet across all sites was 341, though 994 in collective centres and 57 in scattered sites. 80 percent of the 41 sites had  non-functional latrines (74 percent in collective centers and 93 percent in scattered sites). Only 15 percent of sites had  handwashing facilities near latrines. 24 percent of assessed sites offered safe and private latrine access and 51 percent  had separate facilities for men and women. Sanitation facilities in collective centres and informal sites are overcrowded also due to the high number of displaced  populations. According to UNRWA, on average, there are 1,109 IDPs per toilet in shelters in Rafah Governorate, 619 IDPs  per toilet in shelters in Deir al-Balah Governorate, and 1,349 IDPs per toilet in Khan Younis Governorate.102 UNRWA also  reports that there are at least 486 people per toilet in UNRWA shelters in Rafah Governorate.103 Figure 18. Sanitation quantities. Source: WASH Cluster<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF24 Figure 19. Sanitation facilities. Source: WASH Cluster Summary of Acute Malnutrition Drivers  According to the Nutrition Vulnerability Study,104 conducted by the Global Nutrition Cluster, over 90 percent of children  aged 6-23 months and pregnant and breastfeeding women are eating two or fewer food groups each day, often those  of the lowest nutritional value. At least 90 percent of children under five have had at least one infectious disease, with 70  percent having had diarrhoea in the previous two weeks. Against a minimum standard of 15 litres per person, 81 percent  of households lack safe and clean water, with average daily household access to water reportedly less than one litre per  person per day. This extreme lack of safe water access is especially concerning for the greater number of infants now  reliant on infant formula than before the most recent escalation. Low clean water availability and access further exposes  young children to infection and subsequently malnutrition. Figure 20: Acute malnutrition drivers. Source: Global Nutrition Cluster<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF25 Nutrition Outcomes There is very limited data on acute malnutrition available in Gaza since the start of the conflict on 7 October 2023. The  only data that is available on acute malnutrition as of 9 Mar 2024 come from Mid-Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC)  screenings conducted in the three IPC AFI units of analysis, i.e. northern, middle and southern governorates. While some  screenings included children 6-59 months, others almost exclusively measured only children between 6 and 23 months  of age. Additionally, although some screenings contained individual MUAC and age data, others only had MUAC data at  aggregate level. Of the screening data made available for the analysis, one set only included 45 children and therefore  was not considered in the analysis. The remaining screening datasets were analysed as follows: Figure 21. Metadata, MUAC screening results. Source: Various - reanalysis conducted by the Global Smart Team For every screening that contained only aggregate MUAC data on children 6-59 months, first, unweighted prevalence  estimates were calculated for the following age groups: (i) 6-59 months, (ii) 6-23 months, and (iii) 24-59 months. Secondly,  weighted prevalence of MUAC among children between 6-59 months were calculated from the unweighted prevalence  estimates of children 6-23 months and 24-59 months by applying weights of 0.33 and 0.66,105 respectively. Finally, the  weighted prevalence estimates of 6-59 months were compared with the IPC Acute Malnutrition (IPC AMN) reference  table and the IPC AMN Phases were determined. For each screening that only contained aggregate MUAC data on children 6-23 months, the MUAC prevalence of children  between 23-59 months and weighted prevalence of MUAC among children 6-59 months were estimated using the  following procedure. First, using data from screenings that contained MUAC data on children 6-59 months, the ratio  between the MUAC prevalence of 6-23 months and 24-59 months was determined (this ranged from 3.07 to 9.68).  Secondly, using sensitivity analysis, expected ranges of MUAC prevalence among children between 24-59 months were  calculated using the lowest (3.07) and the highest (9.68) empirically observed ratios. Thirdly, a weighted analysis was  performed, and a range of weighted prevalence estimates of children 6-59 months were obtained. Finally, the weighted  prevalence estimates of 6-59 months were compared with the IPC Acute Malnutrition (IPC AMN) reference table and the  possible IPC AMN Phases were determined.<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF26 In conclusion:     •   In North Gaza Governorate , MUAC screenings are indicative of an IPC Acute Malnutrition Phase 2 - 3 (Alert  - Critical) in January, having rapidly deteriorated to an indicative IPC AMN Phase of 4 - 5 (Critical - Extremely  Critical) in February 2024.     •   In Khan Younis Governorate, MUAC screenings are indicative of an IPC Acute Malnutrition Phase 3 - 4 (Serious -  Critical) in February 2024.      •   In Deir al-Balah Governorate, MUAC screenings are indicative of an IPC Acute Malnutrition Phase 1 - 2 (Acceptable  - Alert) in February – early March 2024.      •   In Rafah Governorate, MUAC screenings are indicative of an IPC Acute Malnutrition Phase 1 - 2 (Acceptable - Alert)  in late January – early March.

Source: Various - reanalysis  conducted by the Global Smart Team<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF27 Mortality The analysis could not benefit from representative evidence of non-trauma mortality as intended by IPC Protocols (Crude  Death Rate and Under Five Death Rate). The data available consisted in death counts issued by the Gaza Ministry of Health  and reported by the Health Cluster, and interview data collected during CATI surveys conducted by WFP . Furthermore, a  study on mortality and public health106 was conducted to inform humanitarian and other decision-makers working on  the Gaza crisis by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and the Center for Humanitarian Health at Johns  Hopkins University (LSHTM).  The mortality data collected by the Ministry of Health are not disaggregated by area and appears to only be those  attributable to conflict related violence. The WFP CATI survey data results can be disaggregated by area but not by cause  of death. Therefore, no direct measurements of CDR or U5DR after trauma exclusion are currently available. Nonetheless, it worths noticing that the modelled projections published by LSHTM, while considered useful for  indicating the expected direction of travel and scale of the expected excess mortality, the IPC Famine Review Committee  (FRC) found some of the assumptions factored in the study published in early February might have evolved in different  directions, especially regarding food intake estimates and acute malnutrition.   The absence of usable mortality data in  both governorates leaves a high degree of uncertainty on the translation of these acute malnutrition rate into children  and adult mortality in the current period in North Gaza. It is likely that these extreme levels of malnutrition have not yet  translated into 2/10,000/day Crude Death Rate. The likelihood of having surpassed U5DR thresholds (4/10,000/day for  children) is higher but impossible to ascertain. <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF28 PROJECTED SITUATION MAP AND POPULATION TABLE                                                            (16 March - 15 July 2024 ) Note: A population in Phase 3+ does not necessarily reflect the full population in need of urgent action.

Famine is imminent and likely to occur within the next two months.  The Governorates of Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis, and the  Governorate of Rafah, are classified in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency).   During the projection period (16 March - 15 July), in the most likely  scenario and under the assumption of an escalation of the conflict  including a ground offensive in Rafah, half of the population of  the Gaza Strip (1,107,000 people) is expected to face IPC Phase 5  (Catastrophe), the most severe level in the IPC Acute Food Insecurity  scale. The rest of the population is likely to be either in Emergency (IPC  Phase 4) (854,000 people, 38 percent of the population) or in Crisis  (265,000 people, 12 percent of the population). During this period, the  whole population of the Gaza Strip (2,230,000 people) will face high  levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above). North Gaza and Gaza Governorates In the most likely scenario, the North Gaza and Gaza Governorates  are classified in IPC Phase 5 (Famine), with reasonable evidence.  Famine is imminent and likely to occur within the next two months.   In terms of magnitude, 70 percent of the population is likely to be in  IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe) and 30 percent in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency). Continued conflict and the near-complete lack of access to the  northern governorates for humanitarian organizations and commercial  trucks will likely compound heightened vulnerabilities and extremely  limited food availability, access, and utilization, as well as access to  healthcare, water, and sanitation services. People’s ability to exit the  northern governorates and move to locations with relatively greater  food availability and access is likely to be very limited. Within the north, displacements are likely to remain frequent and  localized; yet conditions in the shelters will continue to deteriorate,  including extreme deprivation of basic needs.  As food stocks or sources (wild foods, livestock, or other types of food  – from domestic stocks, shelters or agricultural assets) will continue to  reduce, food availability is expected to be limited. With the very few  humanitarian and commercial trucks entering these governorates,  it is unlikely that households will be able to restock or stabilize their  food consumption patterns. Due to scarce food availability, the vast  majority of markets are either not functioning or availing very few Assumptions for the most likely scenario  in North Gaza and Gaza Governorates Conflict:  In the most likely scenario, the pop - ulation will likely remain fully exposed and  highly susceptible to conflict. Conflict and  related casualties will likely continue at simi - lar levels to January-February 2024, including  the wider besiegement, neighbourhood-lev - el clearing operations, occasional armed  actor clashes, and a comparable rate of  bombardment (air, land, sea). Basic services  infrastructure will likely remain extremely de - graded, and the proportion of all buildings  damaged or destroyed will likely continue to  steadily approach 100%. Humanitarian access to provide food, water,  medicines, and provision of health and  WASH services:  The northern governorates  are likely to be mostly inaccessible and  intermittently hard-to-reach, given continued  ground operations, bombardment (air, land,  sea), civil unrest, bureaucratic impediments,  and physical obstruction. The humanitarian  space in the northern governorates will  continue to be extremely restricted, thereby  hampering the provision of the necessary  supplies and services to the most vulnerable  population. It will also hamper the capacity  of humanitarian actors to monitor closely  the situation on the ground and to intervene  promptly to provide relief.  Civil unrest: Civil unrest will likely continue  to worsen, including due to intense and  widespread conflict, largely insufficient  basic service provision and humanitarian  assistance delivery. This will increasingly  inhibit the transport, distribution, and  utilization of humanitarian assistance within  the Gaza Strip. Displacement: Displacement will likely  remain frequent and localized and conditions  in shelters will continue to deteriorate,  including extreme deprivation of basic needs. food commodities at excessively high prices. As a result, communities’ coping capacity and social cohesion will be further  strained. Social tensions are also likely to increase putting the most vulnerable at higher risk of exposure to violence and  lower access to food. Physical access to markets is also of concern, due to restrictions of civilian mobility and conflict  intensity. Utilization of food resources will also be heavily impacted as seasonal higher temperatures reduce food storage  options in a context of no or extremely limited access to electricity, fuel and/or gas to preserve, process or cook food.  The lack of access to sufficient and safe water, sanitation facilities and health services is likely to increase the risk of cholera  and the spread of infectious diseases impacting people’s nutrition and health status and increasing mortality from non- trauma related causes. The restoration of public services will be a major challenge given that the majority of WASH  facilities and infrastructure are damaged or destroyed. <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF30 FRC analysis of acute malnutrition trends A detailed analysis of the drivers (risk factors) for acute malnutrition and the available data on nutritional status was provided by  the Global Nutrition Cluster report on Nutrition Vulnerability in February 2024.7 Based on this report and their own analysis the  IPC Analysis Team concluded that the key driver of acute malnutrition in the North Gaza governorate was the highly inadequate  dietary diversity in Children 6–23m, with 79% consuming ≤2 food groups, 8 and also in Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women,  with 95% consuming ≤2 food groups. The main food groups mentioned were non-vitamin A rich vegetables (24 affirmations),  grains (20) and eggs (17). This situation highlights critically insufficient diet diversity and micronutrient intake before and during  pregnancy and breastfeeding, which can affect both the women and the development of their infants. Infant and Young Chil - dren Feeding practices are highly constrained by the lack of resources and health seeking behavior is also highly constrained.  Interviews conducted by the FRC with key informants and a review of available reports confirmed that the situation in the  northern governates during the current analysis period was similar to that reported by the Analysis Team. The health and WASH  situations are also considered separately belo w. Figure 23: Trends in GAM by MUAC Prevalence in North Gaza (children aged 6-59 mo.) Within the IPC unit of analysis, MUAC screening data9 was available from the North Governorate but not from Gaza City. The  available data was collected as part of a vaccination programme and measurements were only taken from children aged 6-23  months. The FRC explored different methods for using this data to estimate the prevalence of GAM by MUAC in children aged  6-59 months. This was a necessary step to allow the classification of malnutrition according to IPC Phases. To provide a starting point for the trend analysis the prevalence of GAM by MUAC in North Gaza in 2023, before October 7th,  was estimated at 1%. This is consistent with previous studies.11 Age-adjustment of the MUAC screening data resulted in a GAM  by MUAC prevalence in January 2024 of 6.8% to 9.1%. By February this had risen to give a range of 12.4% to 16.5%, indicating a  very steep increase in the incidence of acute malnutrition in children 6-59 mo. To estimate what the prevalence would be at the  time of the current analysis in March 2024, two nowcasting scenarios were examined.  Given the extremely poor situation regarding the drivers of malnutrition, the best-case scenario was that there had been a  continued linear increase in prevalence, while the more likely scenario was that the rate of increase would have followed the  observed trend and have increased further in the time since the February screening. These two scenarios were then applied to  the high and low estimates for age-adjusted GAM by MUAC prevalence, resulting in the four dotted lines shown in Figure 2. This  analysis indicates that in all scenarios the GAM by MUAC prevalence had passed the IPC Phase 4/5 threshold (Critical/Extremely  Critical) in the current analysis period. Given the current trajectory in MUAC prevalence data it is clear that the Famine threshold  for acute malnutrition prevalence, measured using weight-for-height Z-scores, may have already been crossed or will be crossed  imminently. These data were collected exclusively in North Gaza governorate.Healthcare availability and access will likely continue to decline, including due to lack of humanitarian access and  inadequate delivery of critical supplies, as well as a decline in the functionality of the few remaining health centres. The risk  of infectious diseases will likely continue to increase due to the extreme deterioration of the overall health environment.  In line with the Famine Review Committee findings, people’s livelihoods and food consumption are likely to continue  deteriorating, resulting in more than two thirds of the population (70 percent) in IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe). Acute Malnutrition will increase at a high pace as already observed in the past few weeks (current period) and  mortality levels will likely breach the Famine thresholds (extremely critical) - by the end of May 2024.<br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF31 Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis Governorates These Governorates are projected to remain in IPC Phase 4  (Emergency), though with half of the population (300,000  people) in IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe), up from 30 percent in the  current period; and the other half (300,000 people) in IPC Phase 4  (Emergency). While this unit of analysis includes both Governorates,  the conditions for the population in Khan Younis Governorate are  expected to be worse than those in Deir al-Balah.  The onset of a major ground operation in Rafah Governorate will  likely be a major driver of deterioration in Khan Younis and Deir  al-Balah Governorates, including through an influx of displaced  populations – many already displaced multiple times – into parts  of these Governorates and the impact of the ground operation  on humanitarian access. Ground operations are likely to continue  throughout Khan Younis Governorate and in eastern Deir al-Balah  Governorate.  Displacement will likely escalate with large populations moving into  the Al-Mawasi area of Khan Younis Governorate and into Deir al- Balah Governorate, especially in and around Deir al-Balah city and  camp. Further displacement will likely stress already highly limited  resources and basic services, exacerbating existing conditions. Shelter  conditions are likely to deteriorate with continued deprivation of  basic needs.  Food availability and access are expected to further decline as the  major ground operation in Rafah Governorate reduces humanitarian  and commercial traffic into and throughout the Gaza Strip. This will  be exacerbated by continued civil unrest outside the Kerem Shalom  crossing, which will likely further reduce humanitarian and commercial  truck entry. Fewer humanitarian convoys to these governorates are  expected, including those unsuccessfully attempting to reach the  northern governorates and offloading assistance in Deir al-Balah  instead.  The already limited agricultural production, mostly of vegetables,  observed in the current period will likely continue to decline as  ground operations are pursued within and near production areas of  both governorates, especially in all areas of Khan Younis Governorate;  and the harvest period for several vegetables comes to an end.  Market functionality is likely to continue falling as agricultural  production and humanitarian and commercial truck arrivals decline.  Civilian mobility is likely to be severely constrained, further reducing  access to food, including through coping strategies like gathering  wild foods or scavenging. The end of the typical rainy period may also  limit wild food availability. Compared to other governorates, Deir al-Balah Governorate had  higher food availability in the current period, including due to higher  deliveries of humanitarian food assistance (proportional to estimated Assumptions for the most likely  scenario in Deir al Balah and Khan  Younis Governorates Conflict:  Conflict and related casualties will  likely continue at similar levels to February  2024, including ground operations in mul - tiple but not all urban areas of Deir al-Balah  and throughout Khan Younis governorate,  frequent armed actor clashes especially in  Khan Younis governorate, and a compa - rable rate of bombardment (air, land, sea).  The wider besiegement of the Gaza Strip  will likely continue. Humanitarian access: Humanitarian  access to Khan Younis and Deir al Balah  governorate - including for the delivery  of life-saving multi-sector assistance to  the most vulnerable populations - is likely  to be intermittently reduced, especially  relative to the higher proportional  delivery of assistance made to Deir al- Balah Governorate compared to other  governorates in early 2024. This decrease  in access is likely due to the onset of major  ground operations in Rafah Governorate,  continued ground operations in Khan  Younis governorate, bombardment (air,  land, sea) in these governorates and within  Deir al-Balah Governorate, and worsening  civil unrest.  Civil unrest: Civil unrest will likely escalate,  driven by intense and widespread conflict  as well as largely insufficient basic service  provision and humanitarian assistance  delivery. This will likely increasingly inhibit  the transport, distribution, and utilization  of humanitarian assistance throughout the  Gaza Strip.  Displacement: Displacement will likely  escalate, with large populations moving  into the Al-Mawasi area of Khan Younis  governorate and into Deir al Balah  governorate, especially the area of Deir al  Balah city/camp. Shelter conditions will  likely continue to deteriorate, including  extreme deprivation of basic needs,  extreme overcrowding, and increased  sheltering in open spaces. population) in parts of January and February 2024. These deliveries appear to have partially resulted from the offloading  of humanitarian food assistance that could not be delivered to the northern governorates. Any accumulated stocks in  markets and households will provide at least a short-term buffer to some of the people in the early part of the projection  period. Khan Younis Governorate received lower levels of humanitarian food assistance during that period, resulting in  households likely to face larger food consumption gaps from the beginning of the projection period. With no major  improvements in the availability of electricity, fuel, cooking gas, and safe water, food utilization will likely be a major  limiting factor in Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah Governorates. This includes challenges to the safe storage and preparation <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF32 Assumptions for the most likely scenario  in Rafah Governorate Conflict:  Conflict will likely escalate, in - cluding the continuation of the wider  besiegement, the onset of a new, major  ground operation throughout Rafah gov - ernorate and concentrated on Rafah city,  with armed actor clashes, and an increase  in bombardment (air, land, sea). Humanitarian access: Humanitarian  access to Rafah Governorate, including  for the delivery of life-saving multi- sector assistance to the most vulnerable  populations and data collection, will  likely be intermittently reduced, though  without total access loss to the Rafah  Governorate portion of the Al-Mawasi  area, where an extreme concentration of  displaced people is likely. Loss of access  will be particularly high to populations  remaining within Rafah city during the  major ground operation likely to occur  there. This disruption will likely result from  the onset of major ground operations in  Rafah Governorate, continued ground  operations in Khan Younis Governorate,  intensified bombardment (air, land, sea),  and civil unrest.  Civil unrest: Civil unrest will likely continue,  including due to intense and widespread  conflict and severely insufficient basic  service provision and humanitarian  assistance delivery. This will continue to  inhibit the transport, distribution, and  utilization of humanitarian assistance  within the Gaza Strip. Displacement: Displacement will likely  increase substantially, with most of the  current population of Rafah city forced  into the Al-Mawasi area of Rafah and Khan  Younis Governorates and into Deir al-Balah  Governorate, especially the area of Deir al- Balah city/camp. Conditions in shelters will  likely continue to deteriorate, including  extreme deprivation of basic needs,  extreme overcrowding, and increased  sheltering in open spaces.of food, lack of safe access to water, and an increasing incidence of infectious diseases, including diarrhoea, among the  general population. Full resumption of cross border water pipeline activity is unlikely, and the functionality of remaining wells and water  distribution systems will likely decline. Wastewater treatment plants are likely to remain non-functioning. Solid waste  management will continue to be limited. Healthcare availability and access will likely continue to decline, including  due to lack of humanitarian access and inadequate delivery of critical supplies as well as a decline in the functionality of  remaining health centres. Infectious disease risk will continue to increase due to the extreme deterioration of the overall  health environment. Low and declining food availability, access, and utilization will likely  lead to extreme gaps in food consumption and a collapse of coping  capacities for the estimated 300,000 people (50 percent of the  population) experiencing IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe); while  large food  consumptions gaps are expected for the 300,00 people (50 percent of  the population) in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency).  With the drivers of acute  malnutrition expected to worsen (infectious diseases expected to  increase, dietary diversity still severely restricted), the nutritional status  of the people of Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis will likely continue  to deteriorate towards critical levels of acute malnutrition (IPC AMN  Phase 4) during this period.  Rafah Governorate The onset of a major ground operation in Rafah Governorate will  likely drive a significant increase in acute food insecurity alongside  other severe humanitarian consequences. The situation is projected  to remain in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency), though with nearly half (45  percent) of the population (around 600,000 people) in IPC Phase 5  (Catastrophe), up from 25 percent in the current period. The whole  population of Rafah will likely be in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis) or above,  including over one third (about 464,000 people) in IPC Phase 4  (Emergency) and 12 percent (about 265,000 people) in IPC Phase  3 (Crisis). Relative improvement in access into and within Rafah have been  observed compared to the previous analysis, with the opening of a  second border crossing in Kerem Shalom allowing more humanitarian  and commercial supply for aid and markets, However, for the projection  period, considering the most likely scenario of a major ground operation  in Rafah, the humanitarian access and space are likely to reduce due  to the escalating hostilities and populations will face continued and  repeated displacement in search of “safer” areas. As many IDPs already  face poor food security, nutrition, health and WASH outcomes, further  displacement will likely cause further deterioration. Existing mitigation  measures from humanitarian services or programmes are likely to be  disrupted by conflict or sizeable displacements and may cause further  family separation or marginalization of the most vulnerable. Local production will be minimal and difficult to access and agricultural  activities (crop production, livestock herding or fishing) will either not  be pursued or remain very limited due to lack of agricultural inputs,  access to assets or land and geographical concentration of displaced  populations. Further disruptions to market supplies and prices are likely  to continue and decrease access to food through markets. Markets or  traders may be displaced along with the population, impacting their  ability to restock or remain functional, especially as populations move  further away from border crossings and fewer trucks enter the Gaza <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF33 Strip. Market-based interventions will continue to be challenged by high levels of displacement, including of the staff of  financial service providers, and a wider loss of enabling condition, including an adequate electricity supply and functional  telecommunications services, physical cash availability and access, and functioning markets able to absorb any rapid  increases in demand. Physical access to humanitarian assistance and markets will be hindered. There will likely be a disruption in social support  systems (e.g. community kitchens) and increased tensions within the community. Rising temperatures and declining access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene will likely lead to challenges in safe food  storage and preparation, and a rise in waterborne diseases or food borne illnesses. Scarcity of firewood will force people  to resort to using unsafe materials, increasing health risks. Explosive remnants will raise concerns about personal, food  and water safety.  Health outcomes and morbidity are expected to deteriorate in this period and even more so with increased overcrowding,  further displacement and/or lower access to health services. A major decrease in food availability, access, and utilization will likely cause extreme gaps in food consumption and  the exhaustion of people’s coping strategies. Acute malnutrition is likely to increase towards IPC AMN Phase 3 (Serious)  as food insecurity, the health environment, and infant and young childcare and feeding practices deteriorate due  to conflict escalation, displacement, and reduced delivery of, and access to multi-sector humanitarian assistance.<br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF34 COMPARISON WITH THE PREVIOUS ANALYSIS In comparison to the previous analysis (projection period December 2023 – 7 February 2024), the total share of the  population in IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe) across the Gaza Strip continues to increase, from 26 percent to 30 percent in  the current period (mid-February to mid-March 2024) and 50% in the projection period (mid-March to mid-July). In the  northern governorates, the share of the population in IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe) increased from 30 percent to 55 percent  in the current period and 70% in the projected period, representing an increase of about 100,000 people and 530,000  people, respectively.

HHS trends in the Gaza Strip<br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF36 RISK OF FAMINE ANALYSIS As per the IPC tools and technical guidance, an IPC statement on the risk of Famine differs from a Famine classification.  While a projected Famine classification is based on the most likely scenario, the risk of Famine refers to the worst case  scenario that has a reasonable and realistic chance of happening. The risk of Famine is only a statement and not a  classification and was designed to complement the standard IPC projections of the most likely scenario by providing  insights of a potential Famine if prospects evolve in a manner worse than anticipated. The elements considered when developing the worst case scenario are described below.  Factor/element Risk of Famine Scenario - Deir al-Balah and  Khan Younis GovernoratesRisk of Famine Scenario – Rafah Governorate Primary Drivers ConflictConflict would escalate to levels seen in  December 2023-January 2024 when a major  ground operation was conducted in Bureij and  Maghazi camps of Deir al-Balah Governorate.  This would include expanding and intensified  ground operations across all central camps  alongside neighbourhood-level clearing  operations throughout Khan Younis Governorate,  frequent armed actor clashes, and increased  bombardment (air, land, sea).. Expanded ground  operations within Deir al-Balah Governorate  would not necessarily be concurrent with a  major ground operation on Rafah.

Humanitarian  AccessHumanitarian access, including for the delivery  of life-saving multi-sector assistance to the most  vulnerable populations and data collection,  to Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah Governorate  would severely reduce, including due to the  onset of major ground operations in Rafah  Governorate, continued ground operations in  Khan Younis Governorate, the later resumption  of major ground operations in Deir al-Balah  Governorate, intensified bombardment (air, land,  sea), the closure of the Rafah border crossing  and reduction in crossings at Kerem Shalom, and  public order collapse.Humanitarian access to Rafah Governorate,  including for the delivery of life-saving multi- sector assistance to the most vulnerable  populations and data collection, would severely  reduce. Access to populations remaining within  Rafah city during the major ground operation  would be completely lost, while access to the  extreme concentration of displaced people  in the Rafah portion of the Al-Mawasi area  would be intermittent. This disruption would  result from the onset of major, rapid ground  operations in Rafah Governorate, continued  ground operations in Khan Younis Governorate,  intensified bombardment (air, land, sea), the  closure of the Rafah border crossing and  reduction in crossings at Kerem Shalom, and  public order collapse. <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF37 Factor/element Risk of Famine Scenario - Deir al-Balah and  Khan Younis GovernoratesRisk of Famine Scenario – Rafah Governorate Secondary Drivers Civil unrestAlready strained, public order would collapse,  involving widespread and intense civil unrest,  including looting, riots, vigilantism, escalating  violence among various social groups, and a  wider breakdown of social cohesion.

Given the continued catastrophic food security situation across the entire Gaza Strip, a risk of Famine analysis was done for  Deir al Balah, Khan Younis, and Rafah Governorates. This analysis considered whether Famine will occur under a reasonable  worst-case scenario during the projection period through 15 July 2024. An analysis for the northern governorates was not  performed as the FRC is projecting Famine in those areas under the most likely scenario. The FRC considered the assumptions for the worst-case scenario made by the Analysis Team regarding the evolution of the  conflict and the expected impacts on food security and acute malnutrition to be plausible for all three governorates.  The intensity of the conflict and the extent of humanitarian space will determine the magnitude and directions of population  movement within the Gaza Strip. It is currently impossible to ascertain the destination(s) of these human-made displacements,  however any further concentration of population in any already highly populated area, for instance as a consequence of  an escalation in the Rafah Governorate driving hundreds of thousands towards Al-Mawasi and the surrounding areas, will  significantly increase the risk of Famine. The FRC considered the risk of Famine statement made by the Analysis Team about Deir al-Balah, Khan Younis and Rafah  Governorates to be plausible. Given the high degree of uncertainty and fluidity of the situation with displacements likely  forcing people to move to and from multiple localities, the FRC felt it was appropriate to group together all three of the  southern governates for a risk of Famine analysis rather than to separate the governates as different units of analysis.    Forced  displacement will increase the risk of Famine because of overcrowding, poor supply of food, water, and medicines, and limited  provision of health and wash services, which will expose the displaced population to epidemic outbreaks.  The FRC reached technical consensus that, under a reasonable worst-case scenario, there is a risk of Famine across the entire  middle and southern areas of the Gaza Strip during the projection period of mid-March to mid-July 2024. The cessation of  hostilities together with the restoration of humanitarian space to deliver multi-sectoral assistance and restore services are  essential steps in mitigating the risk of Famine.<br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF40 CONCLUSIONS OF THE FAMINE REVIEW COMMITTEE (FRC)  This report is the second time that the Famine Review Committee has reviewed analysis conducted by a multi-agency,  multi-sectoral Analysis Team to determine the current and projected food security situation in the Gaza Strip. The first  analysis, conducted in December 2023, determined that there was a risk of Famine within the projection period of  December 2023 to May 2024, and that the risk would increase for each day that the intense conflict and restricted  humanitarian access persisted or worsened.  The findings of the FRC’s latest review confirm that Famine is now projected and imminent in the North Gaza and Gaza  Governorates  and is expected to become manifest between mid-March 2024 and May 2024. The Famine threshold for  acute food insecurity has already been far exceeded and the steeply increasing trend in malnutrition data indicates that  it is highly likely that the Famine threshold for acute malnutrition has also been exceeded. The FRC expects the upward  trend in non-trauma mortality to accelerate and for all Famine thresholds to be passed imminently.  It is vital to note that the projected Famine can be prevented or alleviated. All evidence points towards a major  acceleration of deaths and malnutrition. Waiting for a retrospective Famine classification before acting is indefensible.  The FRC concludes that Famine is imminent unless there is an immediate cessation of hostilities and full access is granted  to provide food, water, medicines, and protection of civilians as well as to restore and provide health, water, and sanitation  services, and energy (electricity, diesel, and other fuel) to the population in the northern governorates.  In the current period  (leading up to mid-March), the FRC finds the conclusions of the IPC Analysis Team for the northern  governorates to be plausible (IPC Phase 4 Emergency). However, the FRC highlighted that: (i) Famine thresholds for acute  food insecurity have already been surpassed; (ii) Famine thresholds for acute malnutrition (Extremely Critical) have likely  already been surpassed; (iii) It is likely that these extreme levels of malnutrition have not yet translated into a Crude  Death Rate above 2/10,000/day. The likelihood of having surpassed Under-Five Death Rate thresholds (4/10,000/day for  children) is higher but impossible to ascertain.  For the Governorates of Deir al-Balah, Khan Younis, and Rafah , the FRC considers the findings of the Analysis Team  for the current period (IPC Phase 4 – Emergency) to be plausible. The projection period identified by the Analysis Team  is mid-March 2024 to mid-July 2024. The FRC considers the most likely scenarios and conclusions of the Analysis Team  for the projected period (IPC Phase 4 – Emergency) to be plausible. However, given the high uncertainty over how the  situation will evolve and a high degree of fluidity given the intensity of the conflict, forced displacements, and constricted  humanitarian access in the next 4 months, the FRC recommends grouping all southern governates together for a risk of  Famine analysis . Thus, for the combined southern and middle governates, the FRC concludes that there is a risk of  Famine during the projection period of mid-March to mid-July  in a worst-case scenario with a reasonable chance of  occurring.  The primary drivers of the food security, nutrition, and mortality situation in Gaza Strip are the conflict intensity and highly  constrained/restricted access, defined as the ability of humanitarian and private actors to deliver the necessary supplies  and services to the most vulnerable population. Only an immediate and sustainable cessation of hostility, accompanied  by a sustained supply of food, water, medicines, protection services, and provision of health and sanitation services  to the population can reduce acute malnutrition and excess mortality. Provision of electricity/fuel supplies for water  trucking, pumps, health services, restoration of agricultural production, and other essential needs are also critical, along  with support for unrestricted civilian communications within and outside of the Gaza Strip. The actions needed to prevent Famine require an immediate political decision for a ceasefire together with a significant  and immediate increase in humanitarian and commercial access to the entire population of Gaza. If this does not happen  fully and immediately, even if Famine is avoided in the near term, the impact on mortality and the lives of Palestinians  now, and in future generations, will increase markedly with every day.<br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF41 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ACTION Famine can be halted. The rapidly escalating hunger crisis in the Gaza Strip must immediately be curbed. This requires  putting an end to the hostilities, mobilizing necessary resources and ensuring the safe delivery of humanitarian assistance  to the people of Gaza.  Response Priorities  Overall recommendations • Restore humanitarian access to the entire Gaza Strip. • Stop the fast-paced deterioration of the food security, health and nutrition situation leading to excess mortality  through:  (i) the restoration of health, nutrition, and WASH services and the protection of civilians; and (ii) the provision of safe, nutritious, and sufficient food to all the population in need.  • The sustained supply of sufficient aid commodities, including but not limited to food, medicines, specialist nutrition  products, fuel, and other necessities should be allowed to enter and move throughout the entire Gaza Strip by road.  Traffic of commercial goods should also be fully resumed to meet the volume of commodities required.  Programmatic recommendations • Deliver acute malnutrition treatment services, specifically CMAM and IYCF-E services throughout the Gaza Strip, with  a particular emphasis on opening stabilization centres in the north. • Supply ready-to-use formula for non-breastfed infants and ensure sufficient access to safe drinking water if preparation  is required.  • Provide complimentary foods and micronutrient supplements for young children, as well as pregnant and lactating  women, the chronically ill, and the elderly. • Restore the functioning of market infrastructures and bakeries combined with cash-based interventions where  feasible. • Rehabilitate food production systems as soon as possible, including horticulture, livestock, and fishing. Situation Monitoring and Update  Considering the volatility of the context and the changing environment, the following risk factor elements should be  monitored continuously: • Intensity and extension of hostilities • Humanitarian access to supply food, water medicines, non-food items • Functionality and access to the health system and WASH supplies and services  • Entry of commodities though the Gaza Strip whether through commercial trucks or food assistance by truck or  airdrops • Population displacements and conditions in collective centres and scattered sites • Morbidity and disease outbreaks  • Acute malnutrition and mortality, with a distinction of the trauma and non-trauma causes <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF42 PROCESS AND METHODOLOGY Similar to the previous analysis conducted in December 2023, the IPC Global Partnership completed an IPC analysis for  the Gaza Strip to inform critical humanitarian information needs. Country led IPC analyses are the cornerstone of the  IPC process and will continue to be so. In the case of the Gaza Strip, with the onset of the conflict and the subsequent  humanitarian catastrophe, there was a critical need for an IPC analysis. Without an active country Technical Working  Group, the IPC Global Partnership made use of its non-TWG led analysis process to inform decision-making around the  crisis in the Gaza Strip.  The analysis was conducted remotely from 26 February to 1 March by over 40 experts from 18 agencies, applying standard  IPC protocols, and made use of publicly available data from a wide range of courses on the conditions in the Gaza Strip  (see below). Based on IPC protocols, the level of evidence of this analysis was assessed as “Medium” (level 2) for each of  the three units of analysis. At the analysis completion, the Famine Review Committee was activated to review the Analysis  Team’s findings. Their conclusions were adopted by the Analysis Team.

The IPC is a set of tools and procedures to  classify the severity and characteristics of  acute food and nutrition crises as well as  chronic food insecurity based on interna - tional standards. The IPC consists of four mu - tually reinforcing functions, each with a set  of specific protocols (tools and procedures).  The core IPC parameters include consen - sus building, convergence of evidence,  accountability, transparency and compa - rability. The IPC analysis aims at informing  emergency response as well as medium  and long-term food security policy and pro - gramming. For the IPC, acute food insecurity is defined  as any manifestation of food insecurity  found in a specified area at a specific point  in time of a severity that threatens lives or  livelihoods, or both, regardless of the causes,  context or duration. It is highly susceptible  to change and can occur and manifest in a  population within a short amount of time,  as a result of sudden changes or shocks that  negatively impact on the determinants of  food insecurity. Contact for further Information IPC Global Support Unit   www.ipcinfo.org IPC Special Briefs are produced by the IPC  global initiative and do not necessarily  reflect the views of stakeholders in the  Gaza Strip. Classification of food insecurity and  malnutrition was conducted using the  IPC protocols, which are developed and  implemented worldwide by the IPC Global  Partnership - Action Contre la Faim, CARE,  CILSS, EC-JRC, FAO, FEWS NET, Global Food  Security Cluster, Global Nutrition Cluster,  IFPRI, IGAD, Oxfam, SICA, SADC, Save the  Children, UNDP , UNICEF, WFP , WHO and the  World Bank. Phase 1 None/Minimal Households are able  to meet essential  food and non-food  needs without  engaging in atypical  and unsustainable  strategies to access  food and income.Phase 2 Stressed Households have  minimally adequate  food consumption  but are unable  to afford some  essential non-food  expenditures without  engaging in stress- coping strategies.Phase 3 Crisis Households either: • have food  consumption gaps  that are reflected by  high or above-usual  acute malnutrition; or • are marginally able  to meet minimum  food needs but  only by depleting  essential livelihood  assets or through  crisis-coping  strategies.Phase 4 Emergency Households either: • have large food  consumption gaps  that are reflected  in very high acute  malnutrition and  excess mortality; or • are able to  mitigate large  food consumption  gaps but only  by employing  emergency  livelihood strategies  and asset liquidationPhase 5 Catastrophe/  Famine Households  experience an  extreme lack of  food and/or cannot  meet other basic  needs even after  full employment of  coping strategies.  Starvation, death,  destitution and  extremely critical  acute malnutrition  levels are evident.  For Famine Classi  cation, area needs  to have extremely  critical levels of acute  malnutrition and  mortality.Acute Food Insecurity Phase name and descriptionLimitations of the Analysis  Given the major access constraints, data on food security outcomes  was collected using Computer Assisted Telephone Interviews (CATI).  Quality concerns regarding the use of this methodology including the  representativeness, and potential biases associated with mobile network  coverage and ownership were discussed at length during the previous round  of IPC analysis (for data collected in November 2023). The Analysis Team  concluded that the data meets the requirements set by the IPC and were  the same for this analysis, especially considering the number of observations.  Through the efforts of partners, gaps in nutrition information were filled  through screening information. The high degree of volatility around the  conflict limits the ability to consider longer analysis periods. Scenarios on the  evolution of the conflict were developed in conjunction with conflict experts  to the best of their knowledge and expertise. <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF44 ENDNOTES 1 PCBS Labour Force Survey, 2022 -

  Partizan.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   Our people,
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  As a result of our general policy regarding the electoral process, our evaluations of the developments and the negotiations, we have concluded: we declare to our people that we will protest the election on the grounds that sufficient conditions are not met in Dersim, where we have the condition to participate in the election in favor of the DEM Party [The Peoples’ Equality and Democracy Party], and that approaches that are incompatible with the interests and expectations of the people are dominant here. We do not support any candidate. We see that the reaction that our people have been showing openly for a while, sometimes expressed through action, is appropriate, and that an organization based on this reaction is a basic necessity. We consider it our duty to do justice to this reaction in our work.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   THERE IS NO GROUND FOR COMMON AGREEMENT!
  </strong>
</p>
<p p="">
<p>
   We acted with this understanding during the election process in Dersim. First of all, we want this to be known. We were open to negotiations until the last moment, expecting joint work, and we even had to make a request in this direction. The findings and opinions we will present here are shared as a result of the somehow forced meetings we had with our friends.
  </p>
<p p="">
<p>
    Our evaluation of the developments and discussions in this process will explain the reason for the stance we have taken.
   </p>
<p>
<strong>
     LET FRIENDS SEE IN ALLIANCE
    </strong>
</p>
<p p="">
<p p="">
<p>
      This issue is important because it shows that the basis of the alliances in question is far from revolutionary, democratic principles and understanding, and these alliances are insincere. The coming together of these understandings does not concern the development of the struggle and obtaining permanent results. It is disconnected from the real agenda and problems of the people. Therefore, it is far from developing a solution. It searches for solutions to problems within the system without touching the system. It should be known that the source of the problem is the system itself. A radical solution to the problems is impossible without drying up this resource. That is why, to date, these institutions have not been able to develop a consistent democratic policy in municipal elections and even in “municipalism”.
     </p>
<p>
      The same result exists today. These understandings, which generally hold the people responsible for every failed practice, have always lagged behind the people, and of course still do today. Our people analyze events and facts more clearly and draw conclusions. The alliance components are tied to each other with a thread. There is an alliance shaped by coercion and “necessity to win”. “Friends should see it while shopping”, our people see the content of this alliance and clearly show their reaction. Of course, it is debatable to what extent it will affect the election results. In conclusion, this reaction is appropriate and justified.
     </p>
<p>
      Alliance talks are always drowning in candidacy debates and turning into a fight over just this issue. Of course, every political movement can nominate candidates and present them to the alliance. If they are going to enter the elections with an alliance, this issue, namely the candidate issue, cannot be left out of discussion. However, candidates should be the last topic to be discussed in discussions; firstly, it should be understood about the reasons for coming together and what will be done for what purpose. However, this is not what we see in the alliance established in Dersim, it was acted through a bargaining method in which narrow group interests were decisive. It is clear that the revolutionary struggle will not develop and the masses will not be able to organize with these understandings. On the contrary, this situation leads to degeneration in ideology. It deepens the separation from the public.
     </p>
<p>
      In order to understand what we have stated above, let’s take a look at the events that took place between the institutions as far as we know about the situation that has developed so far during the local elections process.
     </p>
<p p="">
<p p="">
<p p="">
<p>
         The name “Partizan” represents a certain line and historical accumulation. The group included in the alliance has broken away from it. We reiterate that addressing this group under the name “Partizan” is unprincipled and incompatible with friendship. We will continue to criticize and reject this wrong attitude in every environment and platform we are in.
        </p>
<p>
<strong>
          We
         </strong>
<strong>
          call,
         </strong>
</p>
<p>
         It is clear that this alliance of forces that have lost the trust of the people, formed without self-criticism to the people of Dersim and without being held accountable for these negativities, has no future. We did not have an understanding of being a part of alliances based solely on the possibility of winning elections. We share with the public that we have drawn a clear line between ourselves and this alliance, which neglects to take a sincere and honest stance even though a strong and necessary self-criticism is required and it is faced with an intense reaction from the people of Dersim in particular. We call on all our people to take a stand against these wrongs, apart from their election choices, and to be a part of our insistence on a revolutionary attitude and line.

Since then, the conditions necessary to prevent famine have not been met and  the latest evidence confirms that Famine is imminent in the northern governorates and projected to occur anytime  between mid-March and May 2024.

This analysis  factors in all data and information available up to 10 March 2024 and does not take into account the latest developments on the ground. Key Drivers Restricted humanitarian access Extremely limited humanitarian access to and within the  Gaza Strip continues to impede the safe and equitable  delivery of life-saving multi-sector humanitarian assistance  critical for Famine prevention and response. This includes  severe limitations to the supply of goods as well as basic  services.Hostilities Hostilities continue to involve the besiegement of the  entire population and widespread, intense and sustained  ground and air operations and clashes. This has caused  over 31,000 deaths and injured 73,000 people, displaced  about 1.9 million people, damaged or destroyed over half  of the buildings, and devastated assets and infrastructure  indispensable to survival, including across the food, health  and water systems.Current Acute Food Insecurity | 15 February - 15 March  Projected Acute Food Insecurity | 16 March - 15 July<br/><br/> According to the most likely scenario, both North Gaza and Gaza Governorates are classified in IPC Phase 5 (Famine)  with reasonable evidence, with 70% (around 210,000 people) of the population in IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe).   Continued conflict and the near-complete lack of access to the northern governorates for humanitarian organizations  and commercial trucks will likely compound heightened vulnerabilities and extremely limited food availability, access,  and utilization, as well as access to healthcare, water, and sanitation. The famine threshold for household acute food  insecurity has already been far exceeded and, given the latest data showing a steeply increasing trend in cases of acute  malnutrition, it is highly likely that the famine threshold for acute malnutrition has also been exceeded.   In North Gaza,  acute malnutrition (by Mid-Upper Arm Circumference - MUAC) moved from a pre-escalation estimated of 1 percent to 6.8  – 9.1 percent in January and 12.4 to 16.5 percent in February (weighted for children 6-59). Acute malnutrition (by MUAC)  among children 6-23 months old increased in the same period from 16.2 percent to 29.2 percent. The upward trend in  non-trauma mortality is also expected to accelerate, resulting in all famine thresholds likely to be passed imminently.   The southern governorates of Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis, and the Governorate of Rafah, are classified in IPC  Phase 4 (Emergency). However, in a worst-case scenario, these governorates face a risk of Famine through July 2024.  The entire population in the Gaza Strip (2.23 million) is facing high levels of acute food insecurity. From mid-March to  mid-July, in the most likely scenario and under the assumption of an escalation of the conflict including a ground offensive  in Rafah, half of the population of the Gaza Strip (1.11 million people) is expected to face catastrophic conditions (IPC  Phase 5), the most severe level in the IPC Acute Food Insecurity scale. This represents an increase of 530,000 people (92  percent) compared to the previous analysis. Between the current and the projection period, around 400,000 more people  are expected to slide into IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe). The rest of the population faces Emergency (IPC Phase 4) (854,000  people, 38 percent of the population) or Crisis (IPC Phase 3) (265,000 people, 12 percent of the population).  The escalation of the hostilities has caused widespread damage to assets and infrastructure indispensable to survival.  About 50 percent of buildings - and more than 70 percent in the northern governorates - have been damaged or  destroyed. This has included dwellings, shops and infrastructure, such as hospitals, schools, as well as water, sanitation  and other facilities. Assets and infrastructure necessary for food production and distribution have also been destroyed or  severely damaged, extremely limiting the functionality of the food system.  From a pre-escalation average of 500 trucks a day of which 150 carrying food, in the period between 7 October 2023 to  24 February 2024, only 90 trucks per day, of which only 60 carrying food, entered the Gaza Strip. Consequently, virtually  all households are skipping meals every day and adults are reducing their meals so that children can eat. In the northern  governorates, in nearly two thirds of the households, people went entire days and nights without eating at least 10 times  in the last 30 days. In the southern governorates, this applies to one third of the households. <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF3 CURRENT SITUATION MAP AND POPULATION TABLE                                                            (15 February - 15 March 2024 ) Population table for the current situation: 15 February - 15 March 2024 Note: A population in Phase 3+ does not necessarily reflect the full population in need of urgent action.

At 5,900 residents per square kilometre, one of the  most densely populated areas in the world even before the concentration of most of the population in only one of five  governorates, the Gaza Strip population is extremely reliant on the cross-border movement of goods and utilities like  electricity and water.  In 2022, the Gaza Strip faced an unemployment rate of nearly  45 percent 1 and, by September 2023, the poverty rate was at 60  percent 2, among a population that included nearly 70 percent of  refugees. 3 Due to severely constrained livelihood opportunities,  in 2022, over half of the population was relying on humanitarian  assistance as their main income source and about one-third on  casual labour, 4 with 70 percent of the population food insecure. 5  Conflict . As of 14 March 2024, the ongoing hostilities have  reportedly caused nearly 105,000 casualties within the Gaza Strip  – nearly 5% of the total population. 6 This includes over 73,000  people injured, about half of them women and children, and  over 31,000 deaths. The escalation of hostilities within the Gaza Strip began with  heavy bombardment on 7 October 2023. 7 On 27 October, major  ground operations and clashes reportedly began within the Gaza  Strip. 8 These started in the northern governorates and continued  through 23 November, with a humanitarian pause from 24  November through 30 November. 9 Hostilities subsequently  resumed at high intensity, with major ground operations and  bombardment by air, land, and sea. This included the continued  expansion of a ground operation in Khan Younis Governorate,  centred on Khan Younis city. 10 Another large ground operation began in Deir al-Balah  Governorate on 24 December 2023, 11 expanding across multiple  though not all refugee camps and urban areas in the governorate.  These operations were accompanied by continued clashes  among armed actors. Clashes in the northern governorates, especially some neighbourhoods of Gaza city like Zeitoun,  re-escalated in late February 2024. 12 Bombardment by air, land, and sea of all areas of the Gaza Strip has continued  throughout this period, intensifying particularly before and during major ground operations. Humanitarian access.  Conflict continues to place severe limitations on the ability of humanitarian organizations to deliver  life-saving food, nutrition, health, water, hygiene, sanitation and other life-saving assistance to the besieged population.  Commercial traffic is similarly impeded. Humanitarian access, and the ability of the most vulnerable populations to access  and participate in humanitarian activities safely is highly limited and uneven across the Gaza Strip. Once humanitarian  assistance and commercial goods enter the Gaza Strip, onward access to the northern governorates is extremely limited  and unavailable for extended periods, while access is relatively higher for the southern governorates, particularly Rafah  Governorate. While there has been improvement in access to the Gaza Strip relative to early October 2023, including  the opening of the Kerem Shalom crossing in Mid-December 2023, access to the Gaza Strip continues to fluctuate and  remains insufficient for meeting the basic needs of the overall population.  Severe limitations and attacks on humanitarian staff and assets forced major providers of humanitarian food and other  assistance to the northern governorates to suspend convoys to these areas, including the World Food Programme, on  20 February. 13 Since the previous IPC analysis on the Gaza Strip in December 2023, access denial increased significantly,  especially in the northern governorates. In January 2024, only nine humanitarian missions to the northern governorates  were facilitated, dropping to six missions in February. 14 Figure 1. Casualties in the Gaza Strip reported by the  Palestinian Ministry of Health as of 14 March 2024.  Source: Health Cluster<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF5 According to OCHA, constraints on humanitarian action throughout the Gaza Strip include direct strikes with explosive  weapons on humanitarian convoys, detention of humanitarian staff, road closures, checkpoints, and related blockages  or delays on main transportation corridors. Swarming of humanitarian convoys subsequently increased, including at  several hotspots throughout the Gaza Strip, such as immediately  after crossing Wadi Gaza into the northern governorates.  Physical access constraints further limit the movement of  humanitarian and commercial traffic, including road damage  from bombardment and traffic of heavy military vehicles as well  as the accumulation of an estimated 12,000 metric tons of debris  that may take up to four years to fully clear. 15  Displacement and Movement Restrictions. Displacement  continues to be driven by conflict. An evacuation order was  issued to the entire population residing north of Wadi Gaza  (1.1 million people) on 13 October, 16 followed by orders and  accompanying maps indicating to move as far south as Khan  Younis Governorate. 17 After the humanitarian pause on 24- 30 November 2023, new evacuation orders covering at least   30 percent of the entire Gaza Strip were issued. 18 The unilaterally  declared Al-Mawasi “Humanitarian Zone” was first announced  on 18 October 2023, however, humanitarian agencies did not  agree to the establishment of such zones. 19 The proposed area  has limited pre-existing services, with OCHA reporting there is  “almost no sheltering capacity” . 20  In addition to the closure of some of the main transportation corridors within the Gaza Strip, other movement restrictions  have also been announced, including a ban on movement from southern to northern governorates. 21 Additional  restrictions imposed on populations affect livelihoods and food access, such as a de facto prohibition on fishing and  movement within one kilometre of the border fence, which covers a significant proportion of farmland. 22 The movement  of livestock together with displaced populations has not generally been reported and livestock abandonment is likely  high.Map 1.

Source: Shelter Cluster<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF6 As new evacuation orders are issued alongside with continuation of bombardments  and ground operations, Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) are constantly moving  in search of safety. Most of them have moved south, largely to Rafah Governorate. 23  The population in Rafah has increased about five-fold as a result, rapidly rising from  276,000 pre-escalation to over 1.3 million as of February 2024. A large proportion of  the displaced population is from Gaza and North Gaza Governorates, which have  seen their population decrease by 84 percent and 75 percent respectively. 24 Rafah Governorate, which spans over 65 km 2, now hosts around 1.3 million people. 25  In Rafah, there are 35 UNRWA shelters hosting 882,800 people and another 30  informal shelters hosting 506,300 people, 26 corresponding to over 30 percent of  the population staying in shelters. The formal shelters managed by UNRWA are  overcrowded with severely limited access to safe Water, Sanitation and Hygiene  (WASH) and other services. People in informal shelters face even more difficulties  accessing health, food and non-food services. The lack of Non-food Items (NFIs)  provision in informal settlements has led people to set up makeshift shelters and  tents, which are subject to flooding on rainy days, further exacerbating the suffering  of displaced people. 27  Damages . Destruction and damage of buildings, particularly from bombardment  by air, land, and sea, is evident in all governorates of the Gaza Strip. According to  the recent satellite assessments, by late February 2024, at least 54 percent of all  buildings in the Gaza Strip were likely damaged or destroyed. The largest scale  destruction is in Gaza Governorate where more than 73 percent of buildings are  estimated to be destroyed, followed by North Gaza (70 percent), Deir al-Balah (44  percent), Khan Younis (52 percent) and Rafah (28 percent). 28 This has included  dwellings, shops and various types of infrastructure, such as hospitals, schools, and  other public buildings, as well as WASH infrastructure and storage facilities, among  others.  Food Availability Production . The escalation of hostilities and mass  displacements have caused food shortages and  unavailability throughout the Gaza Strip as the food system  and agriculture value chains have collapsed or are marginally  surviving through the informal market. A significant portion  of agriculture land, encompassing orchards, greenhouses,  and farmlands has suffered extensive destruction. According  to the UNOSAT, the percent of damaged agriculture land  has increased from 25 percent to 60 percent, between  November 2023 and January 2024.29  Extensive damage has been inflicted on the local food  system, including agricultural infrastructure. More than 300  home barns, 100 agricultural warehouses, 46 farm storages,  119 animal shelters, 200 farms, as well over 600 wells used for  irrigation have been destroyed, amongst other agriculture  facilities.30 According to the FAO damage assessment of  February 2024, damage to wells was found to be most  concentrated in the North Gaza and Gaza Governorates; and  in some areas, all the wells were damaged. Additionally, over  26 percent (336) of all greenhouses have been damaged  across all governorates. The governorates with the highest Map 3. Gaza Damage Mapping  26.02.2024.

Source: UNOSAT, 2023-2024<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF7 damage are Gaza (55 percent), North Gaza (48 percent), Khan Younis (35 percent), Deir al-Balah (20 percent) and Rafah  (16 percent). The Governorate of Khan Younis had the largest area of damaged greenhouses (149 hectares), followed by  Rafah (89 hectares). More than 40 percent (6,694 ha) of all croplands has been damaged since 7 October, with the highest reported damages  in Gaza (55 percent, 1,941 ha), Deir al-Balah (51 percent, 1,408 ha), North Gaza (45 percent, 1,402 ha), Khan Younis (33  percent, 1,492 ha) and Rafah (25 percent, 451 ha) Governorates. In terms of cropland type, 41 percent of irrigated land, 43 percent of orchards and 42 percent of rainfed land have been  damaged.31 The hostilities have not only led to the destruction of agricultural assets and infrastructure, they also resulted  in the displacement of populations away from agricultural land and constrained access for agricultural activities. Other assets and infrastructure necessary for food production and distribution have also been destroyed or severely  damaged, extremely limited the functionality of the food system. Although some local production, primarily of vegetables, is still ongoing, it is very  limited. Lack of access to land and destruction of crops are compounded by a lack of  access to essential agriculture inputs (fuel, seeds, fertilizers, pesticides).  Most livestock were abandoned during the large-scale displacement in October 2023.  Remaining livestock are being slaughtered or sold due to the lack of fodder and water  or due to the need for cash or other resources. Similarly, poultry lack animal feed, and  the availability of poultry meat and eggs is reduced throughout the Gaza Strip.  The comparison among the preliminary reports from the FAO Loss and Damage  assessment and the baseline figure from the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics  (PCBS), shows about 70 percent of livestock and other animals have been lost since 7  October 2024. Fishing production is largely halted due to the damage of boats, lack  of fuel and security/safe access. Some fishing is still happening, but it is only available  to those who still possess equipment and have access to fuel.  Food security assessments indicate32 that, due to the lack of food availability, some  households are resorting to eating wild foods. These range from mallow ( khebbayze  in Arabic) to unconventional food sources such as animal fodder and other unsafe  foods. Figure 2. Overview of the damage to agricultural land and infrastructure due to the conflict in the Gaza Strip as of 15 February  2024. Source: FAO<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF8 Imports . Between January and September 2023, a daily average of 150 food trucks entered the Gaza Strip. Between  8 October 2023 and 9 March 2024, this number decreased to an average of 65 trucks per day33 and the availability of  food commodities has dramatically declined. Since the escalation of the hostilities, the number of trucks allowed into  the Gaza Strip has been severely restricted, reducing the inflow of humanitarian assistance and preventing the entry of  commercial goods completely until 8 December 2023. Since then, there was an initial increase in the flow of food and  non-food commodities, facilitated through the opening of a second border crossing (Kerem Shalom).  However, in February, the flow of commodities decreased again and has been intermittent from late January through  February. The month of February in particular saw major variations highlighted in figure 3. The entry of humanitarian and commercial trucks into Gaza is significantly limited to the southern governorates, mainly  Rafah. Conversely, there are very few items reaching the northern governorates and other areas in the rest of the south of  Gaza Strip.34 OCHA estimates that less than 5 percent  of all the food trucks have reached North Gaza and  Gaza Governorates in the past four weeks, while 45  percent remained in Rafah and about 50 percent  reached Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis. An in-depth  analysis of the border crossing manifest allowed to  generate approximate kilocalories values per truck  and per unit of analysis then distributed per area,  using information provided by OCHA and the Food  Security Sector. This reveals that in most days, the  quantity of food translated in kilocalories entering  in Gaza has been extremely below the requirements  in North Gaza Governorates, and mostly half the  requirements in Rafah. The only areas appearing to  have benefited from an almost sufficient amount  of kilocalories (although irregular) are in Khan  Younis and Deir al-Balah Governorates (with higher  quantities in the later). This may suggest that most Figure 3. Reanalysis of food-only trucks entering Gaza through Kerem Shalom and Rafah border crossing. Source: UNRWA Figure 4. Reanalysis of the Kcal availability per unit of analysis.  Source: UNRWA, Gaza Supply and Dispatch  <br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF9 requirements in Rafah. Based on truck entries into the Gaza Strip from 21 October 2023 to 3 March 2024, the proportion of  average kilocalories per day (using a 7-day rolling average) has been consistently below the daily kilocalorie requirements  (calculated using demographic data considering variations by age and gender), with the exception of a short period of  time around mid-January.  A survey conducted by the World Food Programme (WFP)35 highlights that interviewed shop owners are faced with a  significant shortage of basic food items, with 81 percent indicating depletion. Furthermore, 19 percent highlighted that  the available food items are in short supply, and not expected to last more than a week. The formal market has been  heavily impacted with a non-functioning supply chain, and severely damaged shops. Consequently, the informal market  has surged. Informal markets, provide 1 or 2 types of foods (canned foods mainly), and are supplied by the beneficiaries  of assistance (selling or bartering). The WFP market monitoring indicates that most respondents have stocks inferior to 1  week or inexistent for the vast majority of the food commodities, with the exception of vegetables. All respondents have  exhausted dairy products.36 Despite the presence of at least a hundred bakeries in northern Gaza, few are able to operate due to significant challenges.  The main obstacle is the persistent shortage of flour, other bakery inputs, and fuel. In early January, WFP began supporting  12 bakeries in Rafah and Deir al-Balah.37 Access Market functionality. Informal markets now dominate both food and non-food item transactions across the Gaza Strip as  formal markets have collapsed following the depletion of stocks and damage to primary places of business. Selling and  buying is mostly taking place in the street along with potential barter activities. People, and more particularly vulnerable  groups, are increasingly facing protection risks to access markets with the lack of social order and high levels of food  insecurity. There is a risk associated to transporting and carrying food in the street, especially in Northern Gaza and  Gaza Governorates where people have resorted to going out in groups to buy food and/or carrying knives to protect  themselves. The scarcity of items is driving food prices up and reducing household purchasing power. The overall Consumer Price  index (CPI) was approximately 49 percent higher in December 2023 compared to the onset of the conflict; the CPI for  food and soft drinks was 76 percent higher.38  Food aid.  The flow of humanitarian assistance into and across the Gaza Strip continues to be severely disrupted. Between  1 January and 12 February 2024, 51 percent of aid missions planned for the north of Wadi Gaza and 25 percent of  those planned for the areas requiring coordination south of Wadi Gaza were denied access..39 In February, the UN and its  humanitarian partners planned only 24 missions to areas north of Gaza, of which six (25 percent) were facilitated. This  stands in stark contrast to January, when 61 missions were planned to the north, with nine (15 percent) facilitated.40Figure 5. Stocks availability at shops as of 21 January (% of respondents). Source: WFP<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF10 Based on data from UNRWA,41 the maximum number of trucks entering daily from both the Kerem Shalom and the Rafah  crossings was 300 (compared to an average of 500 daily pre-escalation), approximately 70 percent of these trucks carried  food or a mixture of food and non-food items. On 20 February 2024, WFP decided to suspend its food aid deliveries to  northern Gaza as a result of chaos and violence.42 On 5 March, a 14-truck food convoy, the first by WFP to the north since  it paused deliveries on 20 February, was denied access after a three-hour wait at the Wadi Gaza checkpoint and then  looted on its way back.43  On 7 March, 11 food trucks from private sector were allowed to enter. In total, from 5 February to 5 March, 10-15 food  trucks were allowed into the Gaza Governorate to feed about 300,000 people (less than 1 Kg per person for a full month).  Given the spread of the conflict, restrictions on movement and the displacement of the population, the humanitarian  space is constantly decreasing, and humanitarian food assistance is being distributed unequally among areas.  Airdrop operations of food aid along the Gaza Strip coastline began on 26 February 2024. Airdrops mainly consist of  ready-made meals that do not require cooking methods and are of high nutritional value. However, they are erratic,  small-scale, cover a limited geographic area, and are primarily accessible to populations located near the coast, including  those physically able to recover food pallets and packages from the sea in a context of heightened civil unrest. Airdrops  without ground coordination are also dangerous and falling assistance may strike civilians, as occurred on 8 March when Figure 6. Food CPI in Gaza Strip (December 2022 - December 2023). Source: WFP/ PCBS Figure 7. Inflation rate (September 2023 vs. December 2023). Source: WFP/ PCBS<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF11 OCHA reported that five civilians died.44 In  light of this, airdrops account for a negligible  share of the humanitarian food security  assistance in the Gaza Strip compared to  what is trucked in overland. Cash Assistance.  The functionality of cash  assistance in the Gaza Strip is limited. As of  15 February 2024, cash actors had delivered  emergency multi-purpose cash assistance  to over 125,000 households (over 828,000  people) since the onset of the conflict.45  According to the most recent Cash Post  Distribution Monitoring,46 about 71 percent  of the respondents reported that the cash  assistance received helped them to either  access urgent/basic items and services  needed. Most expenditures were on food (89 percent), followed by medicines, debt repayment, water and hygiene  products, and transportation. In Rafah, cash liquidity is a significant challenge47 because of the high number of displaced  individuals and the logistical difficulties banks face in transferring cash. Poor electricity supply and connectivity are also  affecting the ability of financial service providers to make cash accessible.   Figure 8. Planned aid missions by month. Source: OCHA  Figure 9a.

Source: UNRWAUtilization  Before the escalation of hostilities, electricity was unreliable and only available for a few hours each day. The lack of  electricity negatively affected all aspects of life, including food safety, and made it almost impossible to operate food  processing units effectively.48 The main water and electricity networks, fuel and food supplies are now almost completely  suspended.49 Frequent communication blackouts make it extremely challenging to coordinate the distribution of aid,  and let people know how to access it, and when.  The complete electricity blackout that began on 11 October 2023 continues, with only limited electricity generated  inside the Gaza Strip from generators and solar panels. Hostilities in the Gaza Strip continue to prevent the delivery of fuel  to the Gaza power plant, which remains non-functioning, and block cross-border electricity distribution.50 This severely  impacts all aspects of daily life, including the processing and storage of food, pumping and distribution of drinking water,  treatment of wastewater, and the functionality of telecommunications and financial systems. <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF13 The lack of electricity and damage to telecommunication systems has also limited the ability of populations to  communicate and access information like evacuation orders or humanitarian assistance delivery. There have been rolling  telecommunication blackouts since 7 October, with several lasting around one week.51 Fuel was not permitted to enter the Gaza Strip from 7 October until 15 November 2023. UNRWA reported that for only  the bare minimum of critical services in which it is involved, 160,000 litres per day of diesel fuel are needed. This minimum  requirement, which is still insufficient for a full restoration of humanitarian operations and other basic services, has been  met only about 10 percent of days from 7 October through 9 March. No fuel was permitted to enter the Gaza Strip from  20 December 2023 through 7 January 2024, a period of new or expanding major ground operations, including in Deir  al-Balah and Khan Younis Governorates. From 24 January through 6 March, fuel was permitted to enter the Gaza Strip  only on alternative days.52 Even once inside the Gaza Strip, the onward movement of diesel fuel faces the same extreme  challenges as other humanitarian and commercial goods, with little fuel reaching the northern governorates. Regarding fuel to North Wadi Gaza, two (10 percent) of 21 planned missions were facilitated. Both deliveries were  facilitated to a single hospital, leaving other hospitals and WASH facilities without fuel. For fuel to areas South of Wadi  Gaza, 15 (71 percent) of 21 planned missions to areas requiring coordination were facilitated. A total of 300,600 litres were  delivered. However, convoys to Nasser hospital were denied access five times in a row. Fuel shortages in hospitals force  them to cease most operations and may lead to preventable deaths.53 About 250 tons of cooking gas entered the Gaza Strip per day on average from January to August 2023.54 Daily entry into  the Gaza Strip from 24 November 2023 through 10 March 2024 has consistently been roughly 30-40 percent of that pre- escalation amount.55 This has further challenged the ability of the Gaza Strip population to cook food that they are able  to access, presenting challenges to physical and biological utilization. As of January-February 2024, nearly 80 percent of  the population in all governorates reported using firewood as their primary cooking fuel, covering any form of wood  available. Around 10-15 percent of the population across governorates reported burning waste as their main cooking  fuel, while almost no respondents reported using cooking gas. Between 7 and 10 percent of respondents reported  that there was no cooking fuel available.56 This is a particular concern as these populations face major challenges with  consuming food that they may still have access to, in particular flour.  Stability Continued conflict and worsening acute food insecurity and nutritional status also contribute to civil unrest, which  further lowers the stability of all food security dimensions. Civil unrest is a major challenge to the delivery of humanitarian  assistance and to humanitarian staff, and hampers their ability to reach the people in need as well as for the most  vulnerable to access and make full use of assistance.  Recent deaths related to the airdrops and swarming of the trucks entering the Gaza Strip are key evidence of the level  of desperation and acute hunger among the people of Gaza. These also show that even a minimal degree of order to  facilitate access to food and other essential supplies, such as medicines, cannot be guaranteed, given the absence of  civil authorities or organized police. Social cohesion in Gaza is strained, exposing the most vulnerable, such as children  - particularly those who are unaccompanied, women, the elderly, the chronically ill and people living with disabilities to  extreme levels of food and water deprivation.   Food Security Outcomes The most recent WFP survey relied on data collected through Computer Assisted Telephone Interviews (CATI) between  6 December 2023 and 19 February 2024. The number of observations were: For North Gaza and Gaza Governorates: 104  observations; for Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah Governorates: 369 observations; for Rafah Governorate: 892 observations.  Households were randomly selected from a master list of 320,000 WFP pre-conflict beneficiary households representing  80 percent of the total pre-conflict population in the Gaza Strip. Overall, 10,320 households were selected and called.  Of them, 1,365 respondents completed the questionnaires (success rate of 13.3 percent - in line with the 10 percent  to 20 percent typical of CATI analyses in the region), while 19 (0.2 percent) answered the call but hung-up and did not  complete it. The rest did not answer.57<br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF14 Food Consumption Score (FCS). According to the survey, most households across the Gaza Strip have inadequate food  consumption with almost 88 percent of households in the North reporting Poor Food consumption (indicative of IPC  Phase 4 and 5, Emergency and Catastrophe) and 9 percent reporting Borderline food consumption (indicative of IPC  Phase 3, Crisis). An additional disaggregation of the FCS ‘poor’ category (&lt;14) shows that in the North Gaza Governorates,  36 percent of the respondents are not even able to eat cereals daily. In Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah around 53 percent of  households reported poor consumption and 31 percent reported borderline consumption, among them 11 percent had  a value below 14. In Rafah, around 48 percent of households reported poor food consumption and 31 percent reported  borderline consumption of which 5 percent had a value below 14.58 Across all governorates, the food consumption  gaps are clear as most households are unable to consume cereals daily. In the north, the mean number of days of cereal  consumption is 4.4 per week, in Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah Governorates and Rafah Governorate the mean number  of days is 5.14 and 5.15, respectively. Consumption of protein rich food is extremely low in Northern Gaza at 0.33 days a  week and a little over one day a week in the rest of the Gaza Strip.  Reduced Coping Strategy Index (rCSI). Results from reduced coping strategies index indicates that nearly 100 percent of  respondents in the Gaza Strip are engaging in extreme coping strategies. The indicator assesses the frequency with which  households resorted to coping strategies that altered their consumption patterns such as reducing meals, restricting  consumption by adults for children to eat, and borrowing food, in the previous week to cover gaps in their consumption.  Household Hunger Scale (HHS). An increase in the proportion of households facing extreme food consumptions gaps is  observed across all analysed governorates when compared with November 2023 data. About 84 percent of households  in Northern Gaza (Gaza and North Gaza) experienced ‘very severe hunger’ , indicative of IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe), while  8 percent of households reported ‘severe hunger’ , indicative of IPC Phase 4 (Emergency). Compared with the previous  survey round, the deterioration has been significant. In November the proportion of households with ‘very severe hunger’  was estimated at 40 percent showing a doubling of households facing extreme food consumption gaps indicative of IPC  Phase 5 (Catastrophe). In Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis Governorates, 57 percent of households reported experiencing  ‘very severe hunger’ , while 24 percent reported to experience ‘severe hunger’ , compared with November 2023 when only  22 percent of households faced ‘very severe hunger’ . In Rafah, the proportion households reportedly experiencing ‘very  severe hunger’ was 56 percent and 21 percent reporting ‘severe hunger’ .59 Livelihood coping. Some indirect evidence on livelihood coping mechanisms was collected focusing on emergency  strategies contextualised for the very specific conditions of Gaza. The data indicates the highest use of extreme coping  strategies in the North with 18 percent of households reporting that they bartered/exchanged clothing for food, while  12 percent reported begging for food. As estimated 3 percent reported scavenging due to lack of food, and 18 percent  reported gathering wild foods. Around 23 percent reported looting food from debris, and 74 percent indicated that  they sought food outside their shelter, facing potential security risks. In Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis, the reported  proportions were similar: 24 percent of households reported that they bartered/exchanged clothing for food, and in  Rafah the proportion was 27 percent. Around 7 percent in Khan Younis, Deir al-Balah and Rafah Governorates reported  begging for food. An estimated 1.8 percent reported scavenging due to lack of food and 15 percent gathering wild foods.  Around 5 percent in Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah Governorates, and 6 percent in Rafah Governorate reported looting  food from debris. Finally, 65 percent of the households in Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis Governorates, and 59 percent in  Rafah Governorate reported that they sought food outside their shelter facing potential security risks. The survey detected  a high level of non-applicable strategies, which might indicate the pure exhaustion of these coping mechanisms.  Household Economy Approach (HEA) Outcome Analysis (OA): Preliminary HEA Outcome Analysis was made available  by FEWS NET for this IPC analysis. For the northern governorates (North Gaza and Gaza urban area), for the period of  February – August 2024, all the wealth groups categories living in these governorates are expected to face high level of  Survival Deficits (SD), indicative of an IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe). The SD is calculated compared to a survival threshold  defined as the amount of food and cash income needed by the households to meet the 2,100 Kcal per day per person. This  also include the cost of preparing and consuming food plus any cash expenditure on water for human consumption.60  The only exception in these results appear for the Better Off (BO) wealth group living in the Semi Agriculture Gaza (SAG)  livelihood zone with livelihoods more related to crops sales, livestock sales or self-employment, that will experience SD  Indicative of an IPC Phase 4 (Emergency), at the limit of an IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe). For Southern Gaza, the level of  deficit for the projected period of April – August 2024 for the households living in urban areas (URB livelihood zone), will  be indicative of an IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe). For the households living in this governorate with livelihoods more related  to agricultural labour, crop and livestock sales or self-employment, (SAG livelihood zone) – that represent a small portion  of the population living in this governorate -, the Very Poor and the Poor wealth groups will face SD indicative of an IPC <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF15 Figure 11.

This last  deficit is calculated compared to a Livelihood Protection basket that include all the sources of food and income needed  for the households to maintain their local livelihoods.  Gender lens.  Food insecurity has a multidimensional impact on women, as it not only relates to unequal access to,  distribution of, consumption of, and control over food, but it also has long-term health and safety risks.  UN Women data  shows that the escalation in food insecurity has also increased the vulnerability of women to food insecurity. More than  4 out of 5 women (84 percent) interviewed by UN Women report that their family eats half or less of the food they used  to before the conflict  began, with mothers and adult women being those tasked with sourcing food, yet eating last,  less, and least than everyone else. Moreover, 4 in 5 women (84 percent) in Gaza indicate that at least one of their family  members had to skip meals during the past week. In 95 percent of those cases, mothers are the ones going without food,  skipping at least one meal to feed their children. Nearly 9 in 10 women (87 percent) report finding it harder to access food  than men.

Among the main food groups reported, breastmilk was  mentioned for 39 children (83 percent), and eggs for 17 (36 percent). The consumption of all the other food groups,  such as legumes, vitamin A rich fruits and vegetables, other vegetables, grains, meat and dairy products, had almost  completely disappeared from their daily diet, indicating an extremely worrying situation in terms of diet quality. 95  percent of the pregnant and breastfeeding women had consumed two or fewer food groups the previous day. The  main food groups mentioned were non-vitamin A rich vegetables, grains and eggs. This situation highlights critically  insufficient micronutrient intake before and during pregnancy and breastfeeding, which can affect both women and the  development of their infants.  In Khan Younis, 90 percent of young children and pregnant and breastfeeding women consumed two food groups or  fewer in the last 24 hours. For young children, the food groups most frequently mentioned were breastmilk and eggs,  while grains, pulses and eggs were the food groups most frequently mentioned for pregnant and breastfeeding women.  In Deir al-Balah, 86 percent of young children had eaten two or fewer food groups during the day before the survey, while  only 3 percent had consumed five food groups. The food groups most consumed were breastmilk, followed by eggs and  grains. Among pregnant and breastfeeding women, 67 percent consumed only one food group the day preceding the  survey, while 26 percent consumed two food groups. Pulses, grains and other vegetables were the food groups most  frequently mentioned by respondents.  In Rafah, 88 percent (UNICEF) – 89 percent (CATI) of young children had consumed two or fewer food groups within the  past 24 hours, breastmilk, eggs and grains were the main food groups consumed by young children. Only 3 percent had  eaten more than two food groups in the last 24 hours.  Infant and young child feeding practices Neonates face deteriorating nutritional status if mothers are unable to breastfeed due to stress, poor mental health and/ or inadequate breastfeeding privacy, and lack of counselling and support by healthcare providers.62 Further, the high pre- conflict prevalence of formula use among Gazans (58 percent among under six-month-old infants) raises concerns with  regards to potential supply disruptions. Under poor WASH conditions, keeping formula water, teats, and bottles sterile  is very challenging. These disruptions can result in increased incidence of diarrhoea and other infectious diseases, both  of which further exacerbate malnutrition. The prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding is projected to average between 25  percent to 35 percent under a ceasefire scenario (lower than the pre-conflict baseline of 42 percent, reflecting ongoing  disruptions including overcrowding and worsened mental health), falling to 20 percent to 30 percent under a status quo  scenario and 5 percent to 15 percent under the escalation scenario. These disruptions have enduring consequences on  infant and child health. Based on interviews that WFP conducted with eight key informants (four interviews were held  on 11 January, and the remaining interviews were conducted on 22-23 January), widespread weight loss, diseases, and  malnutrition prevail due to insufficient food supplies, intensifying the health crisis in the Gaza Strip.63  Health There are now only four hospitals and two clinics remaining in Gaza Governorate and two hospitals and two clinics in  North Gaza. All of them operate at a very low level and information on the health status of children under five is close to  absent. The survey conducted did not reach a minimum sample allowing exploitation of the information.  In Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah Governorates, according to the Nutrition Vulnerability and Situation Analysis, more  than 97 percent of children under five reported having had one or more diseases in the past two weeks. 56 percent  of the children under five had experienced Acute Respiratory Infections within the past two weeks, 70.5 percent had  experienced diarrhoea, and 82.3 percent had had a fever. This shows the extremely critical health conditions children  face, exposing them to high-risk nutritional deterioration. Trends from WHO corroborate these findings, showing a 55  percent increase in diarrhoea cases in children under five between November-December 2023. While the three hospitals  in the Governorate of Deir al-Balah were still operational in late November, nine of the 16 Primary Health Care Centres  (PHCCs) were no longer functioning, seriously impeding access to health services. On average, 0.49 litres of drinking water <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF18 was available per person per day in the households surveyed, which is far from the minimum humanitarian standard (2L/ person/day).35 The scale of needs is staggering with 100 percent of the 49 households in need of food and hygiene items,  78 percent in need of water, 69 percent shelter, and 65 percent health assistance.  In Rafah, the Nutrition Vulnerability and Situation Analysis also shows extreme health conditions with almost 93 percent  of children under five having one or more disease within the past two weeks, 79 percent had had a fever and 56 percent  had experienced vomiting. The level of diarrhoea is extremely critical with 70 percent of children under five having had  one episode in the past two weeks, and almost 60 percent having ARI (Acute Respiratory Infection).64  Since mid-October, 388,200 cases of acute respiratory infections have been recorded, along with 246,000 cases of diarrhea  and 3,300 cases of bloody diarrhea, 84,000 cases of skin rashes, 12,000 cases of Acute Jaundice (including confirmed  Hepatitis A).65 As per OCHA, 1.9 million IDPs face at high risk of communicable disease due overcrowding of IDP sites and  lack of access to proper water sanitation and hygiene facilities.66 In Gaza, cases of Hepatitis A have been confirmed in  January 2024 and WHO warned that inhumane living conditions will enable Hepatitis A to continue to spread.67  Health system functionality.  In February 2024, attacks against healthcare facilities, infrastructure and services continued  resulting in 58 percent of the hospitals are not functioning in the Gaza Strip, especially in the northern governorates  (75 percent of the hospitals not functioning). According to the Health Cluster, as of 5 March 2024, only 2 hospitals and  no Primary Health Care Centres were fully functioning; 14 hospitals and 20 Primary Health Care Centres were partially  functioning; while 23 hospitals and 62 Primary Health Centres were not functioning. Only 141 medical points in shelters  were available, while 264 informal, public and UNRWA shelters did not have a medical centre available.68 In the northern governorates, hospitals have been offering limited maternity, trauma, surgery and emergency care services.  They also face challenges such as a shortage of medical staff, including specialized surgeons, neurosurgeons, and intensive  care staff, as well as a lack of medical supplies, and have an urgent need for fuel, food, and drinking water.69 In Deir al-Balah  and Khan Younis, according to OCHA, since January 2024, three hospitals – Al Aqsa, Nasser, and Gaza European – were at  risk of closure due to the issuance of evacuation orders in adjacent areas and the ongoing conduct of hostilities nearby. In  Rafah, 5 hospitals are still functioning. The influx of IDPs migrating to Rafah has overwhelmed the bed availability in hospitals,  leading to insufficient capacity to meet the healthcare needs of the population. There is also high need for primary health  services in informal shelters hosting IDPs. The continued besiegement around some hospitals is significantly affecting their  case management capacity. Referring patients outside of Gaza remains a challenge, as the waiting list continues to grow.70 In addition, people are unable to effectively access healthcare due to the lack of laboratory equipment and reagents  needed for accurate diagnosis and testing.71 The risk to public health is intensified due to an acute scarcity of hygiene  materials and adequate sanitation infrastructure. Persistent anecdotal reports of Hepatitis A cases in Gaza, as recorded  by UNRWA and the Health Cluster, highlight ongoing concerns. Limited access to proper WASH facilities is hindering  prevention of diseases. The high number of surgeries and procedures has led to increased demand for anaesthetic and  analgesic medications which are in short supply. Blood and blood products in hospitals are needed for emergencies and  medical procedures to ensure that patients receive timely transfusions.72  Figure 1. Gaza disease surveillance Source: WHO, Health Cluster<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF19 UNRWA stocks of medicines continue to decrease, with around 15 days’ supply remaining overall and one week’s supply  of insulin; some items may run out sooner based on needs at shelters. Therefore, there is an urgent need to restock  medical supplies given the depletion of stocks in the local market. Stocks of fuel and medicines continue to be at risk  of depletion halting UNRWA operations at the health centres. Essential medicines and other critical medical supplies  remain difficult to bring into the Gaza Strip due to strict control of allegedly dual-use items at border crossings and wider  challenges with importing controlled drugs. As basic and specialty healthcare services in Gaza continue to deteriorate,  an increase in excess deaths due to traumatic injuries that would otherwise be survivable with timely and appropriate  care is expected.   In December 2023, UNICEF delivered 962,550 doses of essential vaccines, including for measles, pneumonia, and polio.  Opening of stabilization centres for acute malnutrition cases with medical complications are also planned notably in Tal  as Sultan (Rafah) and another in one of the field hospitals.73 Heightened insecurity and limited access to health facilities  continue to present major challenges for partners to respond and partner operations continue to be negatively affected  by the displacement of staff, social stresses and telecommunication challenges.74   Water, sanitation, and hygiene  Prior to the escalation of hostilities, the majority of the water supply in the Gaza Strip came from groundwater sources  and the rest (around 20 percent) from desalination plants and cross border pipelines. The over pumping of groundwater  in Palestine led to severe water pollution and salinization, especially in the Gaza Strip. More than 97 percent of the water  pumped from the coastal aquifer in the Gaza Strip did not meet the water quality standards set by WHO (PCBS and PWA,  2021).75 Figure 13.

Source: WASH Cluster<br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF20 Nitrate levels already exceeded 150 mg/litre  in most areas of the Gaza Strip, which made  the water undrinkable, given the World Health  Organization (WHO) acceptable limit of 50  mg/litre.  In 2019, the daily allocation of water  per capita for domestic purposes was 77 litres/  capita in the Gaza Strip.77 Taking the high  percentage of water pollution in the Gaza Strip  and calculating the quantity of water suitable  for human use, the per capita share of fresh  water was 22.4 litres per day.78 Damage to WASH facilities.  Based on satellite  damage assessments on WASH infrastructure  dated 21 February,79 13 percent of all sewage  and water facilities have been destroyed (7  percent and 14 percent respectively), while  in total over 56 percent have been either  destroyed or damaged (13 percent and 34  percent respectively). Another 11 percent are  assessed to have possible damage. Overall, this  assessment identifies 77 facilities destroyed  and 254 facilities damaged, with another 67  facilities with possible damage. Northern  Gaza and Gaza Governorates have the highest  concentration of reported damaged or  destroyed infrastructure.  The functionality of, or access to, the 194  facilities (38 and 156 respectively) that were  found with no visible damage is conditional  to access to fuel and spare parts, which are  in very limited supply, as well as availability  of technicians and access to areas with  these assets. The combined damaged and  conditional access to the remaining WASH  infrastructure is expected to have a profound  impact on the availability of water, water  quality and presence of unsafe water or contaminants for populations in these areas. Water availability and drinking water. Water availability continues to be a major concern across the Gaza Strip. In  February 2024, the water produced from all the water sources in Gaza accounted for only 5.7 percent of the pre-escalation  production levels.80 According to OCHA, only 17 percent of the 284 groundwater wells are operating with limited hours  and 39 wells have been reported as destroyed and 93 as moderately to severely damaged.81 Still according to OCHA,  only one of the three cross border water pipelines is operating, functioning at 47 percent of its capacity. Plans to repair  the non-functioning pipelines face challenges in terms of access, communication, or repair coordination considering the  current context. The United Arab Emirate’s small desalination plant located on the Egyptian side of Rafah, operates at full  capacity, providing 2,400 cubic metres per day, following the construction of a 3-kilometre transmission line. In addition,  only two out of the three main water desalination plants are partially functional, mainly in the southern governorates.82   Water quality appears low due to lack of processing facilities or other way of contamination.  According to another study (sample size of 1,200 people)83 conducted in the Gaza Strip in February 2024, access to water  for drinking, bathing and cleaning, is estimated at 1.5 litre per person per day compared to the 15 litres minimum amount  of water required for survival as per as the international SPHERE standards. Similar results from the WASH cluster rapid  assessment conducted in 41 sites indicate a median value of 2 litres per person per day.84 Water production and distribution is a fuel intensive process and the overall WASH fuel allocation is currently 30,000 litres  per day. From 24 January through 4 March, the WASH sector in the Gaza Strip accounted for 30 percent to 60 percent Map 5. WASH facilities damaged, February 2024. Source: WASH Cluster<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF21 of all fuel entering the Gaza Strip, with limitations on diesel fuel entry a major impediment to meeting minimum water  requirements throughout the Gaza Strip, especially in the northern governorates.85 In the northern governorates, water supply remains limited and no access to clean water has been reported.86 According  to OCHA, as of 12 January 2024, the combination of water trucking, water from the functional desalination plant, and the  restoration of one of the three main water supply lines on 30 December 2023, has yielded only seven percent of water  production in Gaza, compared with the pre-October 2023 supply.87 In Rafah Governorate, according to the WASH cluster rapid assessment, the majority of the sites rely mainly on water  trucking and piped water in scattered sites, and collective centres rely more heavily on wells.88 More than half of the  sites provide water that is unsafe for drinking (67 percent in collective centres) and only 12 percent can provide water  treatment at source. According to the Euromed study, in Rafah Governorate out of the 15 litres minimum amount of  water a day required as per sphere standard, only 8 litres are available on average across sites (3 litres in collective centres),  with a median of 2 litres per person per day, indicating high level of disparities among sites. Hygiene.  According to the WASH cluster, in Rafah, 61 percent of the sites in collective centres and 71 percent in scattered  sites have no shower89 and the average number of showers per person is about 3,500 in collective centres and 1,050 in  scattered sites. Access and protection of most vulnerable population is also of high concern, with only 12 percent of the  showers being accessible for people living with disabilities and only 24 percent of the sites having separated showers for  women (14 percent in collective centres).  Figure 15. Quantity and type of water sources per site. Source: WASH cluster<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF22 An NRC assessment90 conducted in nine shelters in Rafah also stated that every assessed location had reported cases of  “hepatitis A, gastroenteritis, diarrhoea, smallpox, lice, [and] influenza.”  Solid Waste Management. In terms of waste management, most of the wastewater treatment systems have been  suspended and non-functioning since November 2023, due to damage, lack of fuel/power supply, and lack of  maintenance.91 Regarding solid-waste management, which was already a crucial issue before the escalation, the last  UNRWA update on 16 January states that solid waste management continues in Rafah and Khan Younis Governorates  and partially in Deir al-Balah Governorate, where approximately 45 truck loadings were transferred to temporary sites.92  However, according to the WASH cluster,93 93 percent of the sites (89 percent in collective centres and 100 percent in  scattered sites) have some type of visible waste, mainly solid waste or trash and 68 percent of all the sites present informal  or uncontrolled dumping areas. The accumulation of tens of thousands of tons of solid waste on the streets, around  hospitals, IDP shelters, and various random dump sites, represent high public health risks. The Gaza Municipality also  estimates that approximately 50,000 tons of solid waste remain unmanaged.94Figure 16. Quantity and type of water sources per site. Source: WASH cluster Figure 17. Waste management. Source: WASH Cluster<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF23 Sanitation. Sanitation situation continues to deteriorate and remains a major issue in all governorates. Despite significant  efforts by UNICEF and its partners to construct family latrines, sanitation coverage remains very low and efforts to increase  coverage are hindered by a lack of cement and other construction materials, including due to constraints on the entry of  items considered to be dual use into the Gaza Strip.95  With wastewater treatment plants non-functioning and many sewage facilities destroyed, especially in Gaza city, flooding  has been a major health hazard through the rainy period as floodwater mixes with untreated sewage in urban areas with  dense displaced populations.96 This is further compounded by the enduring fuel shortage, which impedes the operation  of remaining sewage stations and wastewater treatment plants. According to the WASH Cluster, there is also an increasing  concern about the potential for additional flooding of already contaminated rainwater harvesting lagoons, particularly if  rainfall intensifies. This situation poses a critical threat to both the environment and public health.97 In early 2023, UNICEF  reported that “insufficient safely managed water supply to households, poor sanitation, limited public WASH services, and  risk of flooding expose 1.36 million Palestinians to water-related diseases risks” .98 The situation is exacerbated by continuous restricted access to essential sanitation supplies and services in Gaza.99 The  inability to transport sufficient fuel into the Gaza Strip, and especially to the northern governorates, also significantly  compounds the challenges faced by the WASH response.100  A rapid assessment of displacement sites, including scattered sites and collective centres, in Rafah Governorate was  conducted by the WASH cluster in February 2024.101 63 percent of assessed sites reportedly had access to a sewer  connection (78 percent in collective centres and 36 percent in scattered sites). Few sites reported using buckets/plastic  bags, flush to open drain, septic tank, or flush to elsewhere as a sanitation facility. The median number of persons per  toilet across all sites was 341, though 994 in collective centres and 57 in scattered sites. 80 percent of the 41 sites had  non-functional latrines (74 percent in collective centers and 93 percent in scattered sites). Only 15 percent of sites had  handwashing facilities near latrines. 24 percent of assessed sites offered safe and private latrine access and 51 percent  had separate facilities for men and women. Sanitation facilities in collective centres and informal sites are overcrowded also due to the high number of displaced  populations. According to UNRWA, on average, there are 1,109 IDPs per toilet in shelters in Rafah Governorate, 619 IDPs  per toilet in shelters in Deir al-Balah Governorate, and 1,349 IDPs per toilet in Khan Younis Governorate.102 UNRWA also  reports that there are at least 486 people per toilet in UNRWA shelters in Rafah Governorate.103 Figure 18. Sanitation quantities. Source: WASH Cluster<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF24 Figure 19. Sanitation facilities. Source: WASH Cluster Summary of Acute Malnutrition Drivers  According to the Nutrition Vulnerability Study,104 conducted by the Global Nutrition Cluster, over 90 percent of children  aged 6-23 months and pregnant and breastfeeding women are eating two or fewer food groups each day, often those  of the lowest nutritional value. At least 90 percent of children under five have had at least one infectious disease, with 70  percent having had diarrhoea in the previous two weeks. Against a minimum standard of 15 litres per person, 81 percent  of households lack safe and clean water, with average daily household access to water reportedly less than one litre per  person per day. This extreme lack of safe water access is especially concerning for the greater number of infants now  reliant on infant formula than before the most recent escalation. Low clean water availability and access further exposes  young children to infection and subsequently malnutrition. Figure 20: Acute malnutrition drivers. Source: Global Nutrition Cluster<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF25 Nutrition Outcomes There is very limited data on acute malnutrition available in Gaza since the start of the conflict on 7 October 2023. The  only data that is available on acute malnutrition as of 9 Mar 2024 come from Mid-Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC)  screenings conducted in the three IPC AFI units of analysis, i.e. northern, middle and southern governorates. While some  screenings included children 6-59 months, others almost exclusively measured only children between 6 and 23 months  of age. Additionally, although some screenings contained individual MUAC and age data, others only had MUAC data at  aggregate level. Of the screening data made available for the analysis, one set only included 45 children and therefore  was not considered in the analysis. The remaining screening datasets were analysed as follows: Figure 21. Metadata, MUAC screening results. Source: Various - reanalysis conducted by the Global Smart Team For every screening that contained only aggregate MUAC data on children 6-59 months, first, unweighted prevalence  estimates were calculated for the following age groups: (i) 6-59 months, (ii) 6-23 months, and (iii) 24-59 months. Secondly,  weighted prevalence of MUAC among children between 6-59 months were calculated from the unweighted prevalence  estimates of children 6-23 months and 24-59 months by applying weights of 0.33 and 0.66,105 respectively. Finally, the  weighted prevalence estimates of 6-59 months were compared with the IPC Acute Malnutrition (IPC AMN) reference  table and the IPC AMN Phases were determined. For each screening that only contained aggregate MUAC data on children 6-23 months, the MUAC prevalence of children  between 23-59 months and weighted prevalence of MUAC among children 6-59 months were estimated using the  following procedure. First, using data from screenings that contained MUAC data on children 6-59 months, the ratio  between the MUAC prevalence of 6-23 months and 24-59 months was determined (this ranged from 3.07 to 9.68).  Secondly, using sensitivity analysis, expected ranges of MUAC prevalence among children between 24-59 months were  calculated using the lowest (3.07) and the highest (9.68) empirically observed ratios. Thirdly, a weighted analysis was  performed, and a range of weighted prevalence estimates of children 6-59 months were obtained. Finally, the weighted  prevalence estimates of 6-59 months were compared with the IPC Acute Malnutrition (IPC AMN) reference table and the  possible IPC AMN Phases were determined.<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF26 In conclusion:     •   In North Gaza Governorate , MUAC screenings are indicative of an IPC Acute Malnutrition Phase 2 - 3 (Alert  - Critical) in January, having rapidly deteriorated to an indicative IPC AMN Phase of 4 - 5 (Critical - Extremely  Critical) in February 2024.     •   In Khan Younis Governorate, MUAC screenings are indicative of an IPC Acute Malnutrition Phase 3 - 4 (Serious -  Critical) in February 2024.      •   In Deir al-Balah Governorate, MUAC screenings are indicative of an IPC Acute Malnutrition Phase 1 - 2 (Acceptable  - Alert) in February – early March 2024.      •   In Rafah Governorate, MUAC screenings are indicative of an IPC Acute Malnutrition Phase 1 - 2 (Acceptable - Alert)  in late January – early March.

Source: Various - reanalysis  conducted by the Global Smart Team<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF27 Mortality The analysis could not benefit from representative evidence of non-trauma mortality as intended by IPC Protocols (Crude  Death Rate and Under Five Death Rate). The data available consisted in death counts issued by the Gaza Ministry of Health  and reported by the Health Cluster, and interview data collected during CATI surveys conducted by WFP . Furthermore, a  study on mortality and public health106 was conducted to inform humanitarian and other decision-makers working on  the Gaza crisis by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and the Center for Humanitarian Health at Johns  Hopkins University (LSHTM).  The mortality data collected by the Ministry of Health are not disaggregated by area and appears to only be those  attributable to conflict related violence. The WFP CATI survey data results can be disaggregated by area but not by cause  of death. Therefore, no direct measurements of CDR or U5DR after trauma exclusion are currently available. Nonetheless, it worths noticing that the modelled projections published by LSHTM, while considered useful for  indicating the expected direction of travel and scale of the expected excess mortality, the IPC Famine Review Committee  (FRC) found some of the assumptions factored in the study published in early February might have evolved in different  directions, especially regarding food intake estimates and acute malnutrition.   The absence of usable mortality data in  both governorates leaves a high degree of uncertainty on the translation of these acute malnutrition rate into children  and adult mortality in the current period in North Gaza. It is likely that these extreme levels of malnutrition have not yet  translated into 2/10,000/day Crude Death Rate. The likelihood of having surpassed U5DR thresholds (4/10,000/day for  children) is higher but impossible to ascertain. <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF28 PROJECTED SITUATION MAP AND POPULATION TABLE                                                            (16 March - 15 July 2024 ) Note: A population in Phase 3+ does not necessarily reflect the full population in need of urgent action.

Famine is imminent and likely to occur within the next two months.  The Governorates of Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis, and the  Governorate of Rafah, are classified in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency).   During the projection period (16 March - 15 July), in the most likely  scenario and under the assumption of an escalation of the conflict  including a ground offensive in Rafah, half of the population of  the Gaza Strip (1,107,000 people) is expected to face IPC Phase 5  (Catastrophe), the most severe level in the IPC Acute Food Insecurity  scale. The rest of the population is likely to be either in Emergency (IPC  Phase 4) (854,000 people, 38 percent of the population) or in Crisis  (265,000 people, 12 percent of the population). During this period, the  whole population of the Gaza Strip (2,230,000 people) will face high  levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above). North Gaza and Gaza Governorates In the most likely scenario, the North Gaza and Gaza Governorates  are classified in IPC Phase 5 (Famine), with reasonable evidence.  Famine is imminent and likely to occur within the next two months.   In terms of magnitude, 70 percent of the population is likely to be in  IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe) and 30 percent in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency). Continued conflict and the near-complete lack of access to the  northern governorates for humanitarian organizations and commercial  trucks will likely compound heightened vulnerabilities and extremely  limited food availability, access, and utilization, as well as access to  healthcare, water, and sanitation services. People’s ability to exit the  northern governorates and move to locations with relatively greater  food availability and access is likely to be very limited. Within the north, displacements are likely to remain frequent and  localized; yet conditions in the shelters will continue to deteriorate,  including extreme deprivation of basic needs.  As food stocks or sources (wild foods, livestock, or other types of food  – from domestic stocks, shelters or agricultural assets) will continue to  reduce, food availability is expected to be limited. With the very few  humanitarian and commercial trucks entering these governorates,  it is unlikely that households will be able to restock or stabilize their  food consumption patterns. Due to scarce food availability, the vast  majority of markets are either not functioning or availing very few Assumptions for the most likely scenario  in North Gaza and Gaza Governorates Conflict:  In the most likely scenario, the pop - ulation will likely remain fully exposed and  highly susceptible to conflict. Conflict and  related casualties will likely continue at simi - lar levels to January-February 2024, including  the wider besiegement, neighbourhood-lev - el clearing operations, occasional armed  actor clashes, and a comparable rate of  bombardment (air, land, sea). Basic services  infrastructure will likely remain extremely de - graded, and the proportion of all buildings  damaged or destroyed will likely continue to  steadily approach 100%. Humanitarian access to provide food, water,  medicines, and provision of health and  WASH services:  The northern governorates  are likely to be mostly inaccessible and  intermittently hard-to-reach, given continued  ground operations, bombardment (air, land,  sea), civil unrest, bureaucratic impediments,  and physical obstruction. The humanitarian  space in the northern governorates will  continue to be extremely restricted, thereby  hampering the provision of the necessary  supplies and services to the most vulnerable  population. It will also hamper the capacity  of humanitarian actors to monitor closely  the situation on the ground and to intervene  promptly to provide relief.  Civil unrest: Civil unrest will likely continue  to worsen, including due to intense and  widespread conflict, largely insufficient  basic service provision and humanitarian  assistance delivery. This will increasingly  inhibit the transport, distribution, and  utilization of humanitarian assistance within  the Gaza Strip. Displacement: Displacement will likely  remain frequent and localized and conditions  in shelters will continue to deteriorate,  including extreme deprivation of basic needs. food commodities at excessively high prices. As a result, communities’ coping capacity and social cohesion will be further  strained. Social tensions are also likely to increase putting the most vulnerable at higher risk of exposure to violence and  lower access to food. Physical access to markets is also of concern, due to restrictions of civilian mobility and conflict  intensity. Utilization of food resources will also be heavily impacted as seasonal higher temperatures reduce food storage  options in a context of no or extremely limited access to electricity, fuel and/or gas to preserve, process or cook food.  The lack of access to sufficient and safe water, sanitation facilities and health services is likely to increase the risk of cholera  and the spread of infectious diseases impacting people’s nutrition and health status and increasing mortality from non- trauma related causes. The restoration of public services will be a major challenge given that the majority of WASH  facilities and infrastructure are damaged or destroyed. <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF30 FRC analysis of acute malnutrition trends A detailed analysis of the drivers (risk factors) for acute malnutrition and the available data on nutritional status was provided by  the Global Nutrition Cluster report on Nutrition Vulnerability in February 2024.7 Based on this report and their own analysis the  IPC Analysis Team concluded that the key driver of acute malnutrition in the North Gaza governorate was the highly inadequate  dietary diversity in Children 6–23m, with 79% consuming ≤2 food groups, 8 and also in Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women,  with 95% consuming ≤2 food groups. The main food groups mentioned were non-vitamin A rich vegetables (24 affirmations),  grains (20) and eggs (17). This situation highlights critically insufficient diet diversity and micronutrient intake before and during  pregnancy and breastfeeding, which can affect both the women and the development of their infants. Infant and Young Chil - dren Feeding practices are highly constrained by the lack of resources and health seeking behavior is also highly constrained.  Interviews conducted by the FRC with key informants and a review of available reports confirmed that the situation in the  northern governates during the current analysis period was similar to that reported by the Analysis Team. The health and WASH  situations are also considered separately belo w. Figure 23: Trends in GAM by MUAC Prevalence in North Gaza (children aged 6-59 mo.) Within the IPC unit of analysis, MUAC screening data9 was available from the North Governorate but not from Gaza City. The  available data was collected as part of a vaccination programme and measurements were only taken from children aged 6-23  months. The FRC explored different methods for using this data to estimate the prevalence of GAM by MUAC in children aged  6-59 months. This was a necessary step to allow the classification of malnutrition according to IPC Phases. To provide a starting point for the trend analysis the prevalence of GAM by MUAC in North Gaza in 2023, before October 7th,  was estimated at 1%. This is consistent with previous studies.11 Age-adjustment of the MUAC screening data resulted in a GAM  by MUAC prevalence in January 2024 of 6.8% to 9.1%. By February this had risen to give a range of 12.4% to 16.5%, indicating a  very steep increase in the incidence of acute malnutrition in children 6-59 mo. To estimate what the prevalence would be at the  time of the current analysis in March 2024, two nowcasting scenarios were examined.  Given the extremely poor situation regarding the drivers of malnutrition, the best-case scenario was that there had been a  continued linear increase in prevalence, while the more likely scenario was that the rate of increase would have followed the  observed trend and have increased further in the time since the February screening. These two scenarios were then applied to  the high and low estimates for age-adjusted GAM by MUAC prevalence, resulting in the four dotted lines shown in Figure 2. This  analysis indicates that in all scenarios the GAM by MUAC prevalence had passed the IPC Phase 4/5 threshold (Critical/Extremely  Critical) in the current analysis period. Given the current trajectory in MUAC prevalence data it is clear that the Famine threshold  for acute malnutrition prevalence, measured using weight-for-height Z-scores, may have already been crossed or will be crossed  imminently. These data were collected exclusively in North Gaza governorate.Healthcare availability and access will likely continue to decline, including due to lack of humanitarian access and  inadequate delivery of critical supplies, as well as a decline in the functionality of the few remaining health centres. The risk  of infectious diseases will likely continue to increase due to the extreme deterioration of the overall health environment.  In line with the Famine Review Committee findings, people’s livelihoods and food consumption are likely to continue  deteriorating, resulting in more than two thirds of the population (70 percent) in IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe). Acute Malnutrition will increase at a high pace as already observed in the past few weeks (current period) and  mortality levels will likely breach the Famine thresholds (extremely critical) - by the end of May 2024.<br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF31 Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis Governorates These Governorates are projected to remain in IPC Phase 4  (Emergency), though with half of the population (300,000  people) in IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe), up from 30 percent in the  current period; and the other half (300,000 people) in IPC Phase 4  (Emergency). While this unit of analysis includes both Governorates,  the conditions for the population in Khan Younis Governorate are  expected to be worse than those in Deir al-Balah.  The onset of a major ground operation in Rafah Governorate will  likely be a major driver of deterioration in Khan Younis and Deir  al-Balah Governorates, including through an influx of displaced  populations – many already displaced multiple times – into parts  of these Governorates and the impact of the ground operation  on humanitarian access. Ground operations are likely to continue  throughout Khan Younis Governorate and in eastern Deir al-Balah  Governorate.  Displacement will likely escalate with large populations moving into  the Al-Mawasi area of Khan Younis Governorate and into Deir al- Balah Governorate, especially in and around Deir al-Balah city and  camp. Further displacement will likely stress already highly limited  resources and basic services, exacerbating existing conditions. Shelter  conditions are likely to deteriorate with continued deprivation of  basic needs.  Food availability and access are expected to further decline as the  major ground operation in Rafah Governorate reduces humanitarian  and commercial traffic into and throughout the Gaza Strip. This will  be exacerbated by continued civil unrest outside the Kerem Shalom  crossing, which will likely further reduce humanitarian and commercial  truck entry. Fewer humanitarian convoys to these governorates are  expected, including those unsuccessfully attempting to reach the  northern governorates and offloading assistance in Deir al-Balah  instead.  The already limited agricultural production, mostly of vegetables,  observed in the current period will likely continue to decline as  ground operations are pursued within and near production areas of  both governorates, especially in all areas of Khan Younis Governorate;  and the harvest period for several vegetables comes to an end.  Market functionality is likely to continue falling as agricultural  production and humanitarian and commercial truck arrivals decline.  Civilian mobility is likely to be severely constrained, further reducing  access to food, including through coping strategies like gathering  wild foods or scavenging. The end of the typical rainy period may also  limit wild food availability. Compared to other governorates, Deir al-Balah Governorate had  higher food availability in the current period, including due to higher  deliveries of humanitarian food assistance (proportional to estimated Assumptions for the most likely  scenario in Deir al Balah and Khan  Younis Governorates Conflict:  Conflict and related casualties will  likely continue at similar levels to February  2024, including ground operations in mul - tiple but not all urban areas of Deir al-Balah  and throughout Khan Younis governorate,  frequent armed actor clashes especially in  Khan Younis governorate, and a compa - rable rate of bombardment (air, land, sea).  The wider besiegement of the Gaza Strip  will likely continue. Humanitarian access: Humanitarian  access to Khan Younis and Deir al Balah  governorate - including for the delivery  of life-saving multi-sector assistance to  the most vulnerable populations - is likely  to be intermittently reduced, especially  relative to the higher proportional  delivery of assistance made to Deir al- Balah Governorate compared to other  governorates in early 2024. This decrease  in access is likely due to the onset of major  ground operations in Rafah Governorate,  continued ground operations in Khan  Younis governorate, bombardment (air,  land, sea) in these governorates and within  Deir al-Balah Governorate, and worsening  civil unrest.  Civil unrest: Civil unrest will likely escalate,  driven by intense and widespread conflict  as well as largely insufficient basic service  provision and humanitarian assistance  delivery. This will likely increasingly inhibit  the transport, distribution, and utilization  of humanitarian assistance throughout the  Gaza Strip.  Displacement: Displacement will likely  escalate, with large populations moving  into the Al-Mawasi area of Khan Younis  governorate and into Deir al Balah  governorate, especially the area of Deir al  Balah city/camp. Shelter conditions will  likely continue to deteriorate, including  extreme deprivation of basic needs,  extreme overcrowding, and increased  sheltering in open spaces. population) in parts of January and February 2024. These deliveries appear to have partially resulted from the offloading  of humanitarian food assistance that could not be delivered to the northern governorates. Any accumulated stocks in  markets and households will provide at least a short-term buffer to some of the people in the early part of the projection  period. Khan Younis Governorate received lower levels of humanitarian food assistance during that period, resulting in  households likely to face larger food consumption gaps from the beginning of the projection period. With no major  improvements in the availability of electricity, fuel, cooking gas, and safe water, food utilization will likely be a major  limiting factor in Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah Governorates. This includes challenges to the safe storage and preparation <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF32 Assumptions for the most likely scenario  in Rafah Governorate Conflict:  Conflict will likely escalate, in - cluding the continuation of the wider  besiegement, the onset of a new, major  ground operation throughout Rafah gov - ernorate and concentrated on Rafah city,  with armed actor clashes, and an increase  in bombardment (air, land, sea). Humanitarian access: Humanitarian  access to Rafah Governorate, including  for the delivery of life-saving multi- sector assistance to the most vulnerable  populations and data collection, will  likely be intermittently reduced, though  without total access loss to the Rafah  Governorate portion of the Al-Mawasi  area, where an extreme concentration of  displaced people is likely. Loss of access  will be particularly high to populations  remaining within Rafah city during the  major ground operation likely to occur  there. This disruption will likely result from  the onset of major ground operations in  Rafah Governorate, continued ground  operations in Khan Younis Governorate,  intensified bombardment (air, land, sea),  and civil unrest.  Civil unrest: Civil unrest will likely continue,  including due to intense and widespread  conflict and severely insufficient basic  service provision and humanitarian  assistance delivery. This will continue to  inhibit the transport, distribution, and  utilization of humanitarian assistance  within the Gaza Strip. Displacement: Displacement will likely  increase substantially, with most of the  current population of Rafah city forced  into the Al-Mawasi area of Rafah and Khan  Younis Governorates and into Deir al-Balah  Governorate, especially the area of Deir al- Balah city/camp. Conditions in shelters will  likely continue to deteriorate, including  extreme deprivation of basic needs,  extreme overcrowding, and increased  sheltering in open spaces.of food, lack of safe access to water, and an increasing incidence of infectious diseases, including diarrhoea, among the  general population. Full resumption of cross border water pipeline activity is unlikely, and the functionality of remaining wells and water  distribution systems will likely decline. Wastewater treatment plants are likely to remain non-functioning. Solid waste  management will continue to be limited. Healthcare availability and access will likely continue to decline, including  due to lack of humanitarian access and inadequate delivery of critical supplies as well as a decline in the functionality of  remaining health centres. Infectious disease risk will continue to increase due to the extreme deterioration of the overall  health environment. Low and declining food availability, access, and utilization will likely  lead to extreme gaps in food consumption and a collapse of coping  capacities for the estimated 300,000 people (50 percent of the  population) experiencing IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe); while  large food  consumptions gaps are expected for the 300,00 people (50 percent of  the population) in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency).  With the drivers of acute  malnutrition expected to worsen (infectious diseases expected to  increase, dietary diversity still severely restricted), the nutritional status  of the people of Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis will likely continue  to deteriorate towards critical levels of acute malnutrition (IPC AMN  Phase 4) during this period.  Rafah Governorate The onset of a major ground operation in Rafah Governorate will  likely drive a significant increase in acute food insecurity alongside  other severe humanitarian consequences. The situation is projected  to remain in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency), though with nearly half (45  percent) of the population (around 600,000 people) in IPC Phase 5  (Catastrophe), up from 25 percent in the current period. The whole  population of Rafah will likely be in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis) or above,  including over one third (about 464,000 people) in IPC Phase 4  (Emergency) and 12 percent (about 265,000 people) in IPC Phase  3 (Crisis). Relative improvement in access into and within Rafah have been  observed compared to the previous analysis, with the opening of a  second border crossing in Kerem Shalom allowing more humanitarian  and commercial supply for aid and markets, However, for the projection  period, considering the most likely scenario of a major ground operation  in Rafah, the humanitarian access and space are likely to reduce due  to the escalating hostilities and populations will face continued and  repeated displacement in search of “safer” areas. As many IDPs already  face poor food security, nutrition, health and WASH outcomes, further  displacement will likely cause further deterioration. Existing mitigation  measures from humanitarian services or programmes are likely to be  disrupted by conflict or sizeable displacements and may cause further  family separation or marginalization of the most vulnerable. Local production will be minimal and difficult to access and agricultural  activities (crop production, livestock herding or fishing) will either not  be pursued or remain very limited due to lack of agricultural inputs,  access to assets or land and geographical concentration of displaced  populations. Further disruptions to market supplies and prices are likely  to continue and decrease access to food through markets. Markets or  traders may be displaced along with the population, impacting their  ability to restock or remain functional, especially as populations move  further away from border crossings and fewer trucks enter the Gaza <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF33 Strip. Market-based interventions will continue to be challenged by high levels of displacement, including of the staff of  financial service providers, and a wider loss of enabling condition, including an adequate electricity supply and functional  telecommunications services, physical cash availability and access, and functioning markets able to absorb any rapid  increases in demand. Physical access to humanitarian assistance and markets will be hindered. There will likely be a disruption in social support  systems (e.g. community kitchens) and increased tensions within the community. Rising temperatures and declining access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene will likely lead to challenges in safe food  storage and preparation, and a rise in waterborne diseases or food borne illnesses. Scarcity of firewood will force people  to resort to using unsafe materials, increasing health risks. Explosive remnants will raise concerns about personal, food  and water safety.  Health outcomes and morbidity are expected to deteriorate in this period and even more so with increased overcrowding,  further displacement and/or lower access to health services. A major decrease in food availability, access, and utilization will likely cause extreme gaps in food consumption and  the exhaustion of people’s coping strategies. Acute malnutrition is likely to increase towards IPC AMN Phase 3 (Serious)  as food insecurity, the health environment, and infant and young childcare and feeding practices deteriorate due  to conflict escalation, displacement, and reduced delivery of, and access to multi-sector humanitarian assistance.<br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF34 COMPARISON WITH THE PREVIOUS ANALYSIS In comparison to the previous analysis (projection period December 2023 – 7 February 2024), the total share of the  population in IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe) across the Gaza Strip continues to increase, from 26 percent to 30 percent in  the current period (mid-February to mid-March 2024) and 50% in the projection period (mid-March to mid-July). In the  northern governorates, the share of the population in IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe) increased from 30 percent to 55 percent  in the current period and 70% in the projected period, representing an increase of about 100,000 people and 530,000  people, respectively.

HHS trends in the Gaza Strip<br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF36 RISK OF FAMINE ANALYSIS As per the IPC tools and technical guidance, an IPC statement on the risk of Famine differs from a Famine classification.  While a projected Famine classification is based on the most likely scenario, the risk of Famine refers to the worst case  scenario that has a reasonable and realistic chance of happening. The risk of Famine is only a statement and not a  classification and was designed to complement the standard IPC projections of the most likely scenario by providing  insights of a potential Famine if prospects evolve in a manner worse than anticipated. The elements considered when developing the worst case scenario are described below.  Factor/element Risk of Famine Scenario - Deir al-Balah and  Khan Younis GovernoratesRisk of Famine Scenario – Rafah Governorate Primary Drivers ConflictConflict would escalate to levels seen in  December 2023-January 2024 when a major  ground operation was conducted in Bureij and  Maghazi camps of Deir al-Balah Governorate.  This would include expanding and intensified  ground operations across all central camps  alongside neighbourhood-level clearing  operations throughout Khan Younis Governorate,  frequent armed actor clashes, and increased  bombardment (air, land, sea).. Expanded ground  operations within Deir al-Balah Governorate  would not necessarily be concurrent with a  major ground operation on Rafah.

Humanitarian  AccessHumanitarian access, including for the delivery  of life-saving multi-sector assistance to the most  vulnerable populations and data collection,  to Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah Governorate  would severely reduce, including due to the  onset of major ground operations in Rafah  Governorate, continued ground operations in  Khan Younis Governorate, the later resumption  of major ground operations in Deir al-Balah  Governorate, intensified bombardment (air, land,  sea), the closure of the Rafah border crossing  and reduction in crossings at Kerem Shalom, and  public order collapse.Humanitarian access to Rafah Governorate,  including for the delivery of life-saving multi- sector assistance to the most vulnerable  populations and data collection, would severely  reduce. Access to populations remaining within  Rafah city during the major ground operation  would be completely lost, while access to the  extreme concentration of displaced people  in the Rafah portion of the Al-Mawasi area  would be intermittent. This disruption would  result from the onset of major, rapid ground  operations in Rafah Governorate, continued  ground operations in Khan Younis Governorate,  intensified bombardment (air, land, sea), the  closure of the Rafah border crossing and  reduction in crossings at Kerem Shalom, and  public order collapse. <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF37 Factor/element Risk of Famine Scenario - Deir al-Balah and  Khan Younis GovernoratesRisk of Famine Scenario – Rafah Governorate Secondary Drivers Civil unrestAlready strained, public order would collapse,  involving widespread and intense civil unrest,  including looting, riots, vigilantism, escalating  violence among various social groups, and a  wider breakdown of social cohesion.

Given the continued catastrophic food security situation across the entire Gaza Strip, a risk of Famine analysis was done for  Deir al Balah, Khan Younis, and Rafah Governorates. This analysis considered whether Famine will occur under a reasonable  worst-case scenario during the projection period through 15 July 2024. An analysis for the northern governorates was not  performed as the FRC is projecting Famine in those areas under the most likely scenario. The FRC considered the assumptions for the worst-case scenario made by the Analysis Team regarding the evolution of the  conflict and the expected impacts on food security and acute malnutrition to be plausible for all three governorates.  The intensity of the conflict and the extent of humanitarian space will determine the magnitude and directions of population  movement within the Gaza Strip. It is currently impossible to ascertain the destination(s) of these human-made displacements,  however any further concentration of population in any already highly populated area, for instance as a consequence of  an escalation in the Rafah Governorate driving hundreds of thousands towards Al-Mawasi and the surrounding areas, will  significantly increase the risk of Famine. The FRC considered the risk of Famine statement made by the Analysis Team about Deir al-Balah, Khan Younis and Rafah  Governorates to be plausible. Given the high degree of uncertainty and fluidity of the situation with displacements likely  forcing people to move to and from multiple localities, the FRC felt it was appropriate to group together all three of the  southern governates for a risk of Famine analysis rather than to separate the governates as different units of analysis.    Forced  displacement will increase the risk of Famine because of overcrowding, poor supply of food, water, and medicines, and limited  provision of health and wash services, which will expose the displaced population to epidemic outbreaks.  The FRC reached technical consensus that, under a reasonable worst-case scenario, there is a risk of Famine across the entire  middle and southern areas of the Gaza Strip during the projection period of mid-March to mid-July 2024. The cessation of  hostilities together with the restoration of humanitarian space to deliver multi-sectoral assistance and restore services are  essential steps in mitigating the risk of Famine.<br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF40 CONCLUSIONS OF THE FAMINE REVIEW COMMITTEE (FRC)  This report is the second time that the Famine Review Committee has reviewed analysis conducted by a multi-agency,  multi-sectoral Analysis Team to determine the current and projected food security situation in the Gaza Strip. The first  analysis, conducted in December 2023, determined that there was a risk of Famine within the projection period of  December 2023 to May 2024, and that the risk would increase for each day that the intense conflict and restricted  humanitarian access persisted or worsened.  The findings of the FRC’s latest review confirm that Famine is now projected and imminent in the North Gaza and Gaza  Governorates  and is expected to become manifest between mid-March 2024 and May 2024. The Famine threshold for  acute food insecurity has already been far exceeded and the steeply increasing trend in malnutrition data indicates that  it is highly likely that the Famine threshold for acute malnutrition has also been exceeded. The FRC expects the upward  trend in non-trauma mortality to accelerate and for all Famine thresholds to be passed imminently.  It is vital to note that the projected Famine can be prevented or alleviated. All evidence points towards a major  acceleration of deaths and malnutrition. Waiting for a retrospective Famine classification before acting is indefensible.  The FRC concludes that Famine is imminent unless there is an immediate cessation of hostilities and full access is granted  to provide food, water, medicines, and protection of civilians as well as to restore and provide health, water, and sanitation  services, and energy (electricity, diesel, and other fuel) to the population in the northern governorates.  In the current period  (leading up to mid-March), the FRC finds the conclusions of the IPC Analysis Team for the northern  governorates to be plausible (IPC Phase 4 Emergency). However, the FRC highlighted that: (i) Famine thresholds for acute  food insecurity have already been surpassed; (ii) Famine thresholds for acute malnutrition (Extremely Critical) have likely  already been surpassed; (iii) It is likely that these extreme levels of malnutrition have not yet translated into a Crude  Death Rate above 2/10,000/day. The likelihood of having surpassed Under-Five Death Rate thresholds (4/10,000/day for  children) is higher but impossible to ascertain.  For the Governorates of Deir al-Balah, Khan Younis, and Rafah , the FRC considers the findings of the Analysis Team  for the current period (IPC Phase 4 – Emergency) to be plausible. The projection period identified by the Analysis Team  is mid-March 2024 to mid-July 2024. The FRC considers the most likely scenarios and conclusions of the Analysis Team  for the projected period (IPC Phase 4 – Emergency) to be plausible. However, given the high uncertainty over how the  situation will evolve and a high degree of fluidity given the intensity of the conflict, forced displacements, and constricted  humanitarian access in the next 4 months, the FRC recommends grouping all southern governates together for a risk of  Famine analysis . Thus, for the combined southern and middle governates, the FRC concludes that there is a risk of  Famine during the projection period of mid-March to mid-July  in a worst-case scenario with a reasonable chance of  occurring.  The primary drivers of the food security, nutrition, and mortality situation in Gaza Strip are the conflict intensity and highly  constrained/restricted access, defined as the ability of humanitarian and private actors to deliver the necessary supplies  and services to the most vulnerable population. Only an immediate and sustainable cessation of hostility, accompanied  by a sustained supply of food, water, medicines, protection services, and provision of health and sanitation services  to the population can reduce acute malnutrition and excess mortality. Provision of electricity/fuel supplies for water  trucking, pumps, health services, restoration of agricultural production, and other essential needs are also critical, along  with support for unrestricted civilian communications within and outside of the Gaza Strip. The actions needed to prevent Famine require an immediate political decision for a ceasefire together with a significant  and immediate increase in humanitarian and commercial access to the entire population of Gaza. If this does not happen  fully and immediately, even if Famine is avoided in the near term, the impact on mortality and the lives of Palestinians  now, and in future generations, will increase markedly with every day.<br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF41 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ACTION Famine can be halted. The rapidly escalating hunger crisis in the Gaza Strip must immediately be curbed. This requires  putting an end to the hostilities, mobilizing necessary resources and ensuring the safe delivery of humanitarian assistance  to the people of Gaza.  Response Priorities  Overall recommendations • Restore humanitarian access to the entire Gaza Strip. • Stop the fast-paced deterioration of the food security, health and nutrition situation leading to excess mortality  through:  (i) the restoration of health, nutrition, and WASH services and the protection of civilians; and (ii) the provision of safe, nutritious, and sufficient food to all the population in need.  • The sustained supply of sufficient aid commodities, including but not limited to food, medicines, specialist nutrition  products, fuel, and other necessities should be allowed to enter and move throughout the entire Gaza Strip by road.  Traffic of commercial goods should also be fully resumed to meet the volume of commodities required.  Programmatic recommendations • Deliver acute malnutrition treatment services, specifically CMAM and IYCF-E services throughout the Gaza Strip, with  a particular emphasis on opening stabilization centres in the north. • Supply ready-to-use formula for non-breastfed infants and ensure sufficient access to safe drinking water if preparation  is required.  • Provide complimentary foods and micronutrient supplements for young children, as well as pregnant and lactating  women, the chronically ill, and the elderly. • Restore the functioning of market infrastructures and bakeries combined with cash-based interventions where  feasible. • Rehabilitate food production systems as soon as possible, including horticulture, livestock, and fishing. Situation Monitoring and Update  Considering the volatility of the context and the changing environment, the following risk factor elements should be  monitored continuously: • Intensity and extension of hostilities • Humanitarian access to supply food, water medicines, non-food items • Functionality and access to the health system and WASH supplies and services  • Entry of commodities though the Gaza Strip whether through commercial trucks or food assistance by truck or  airdrops • Population displacements and conditions in collective centres and scattered sites • Morbidity and disease outbreaks  • Acute malnutrition and mortality, with a distinction of the trauma and non-trauma causes <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF42 PROCESS AND METHODOLOGY Similar to the previous analysis conducted in December 2023, the IPC Global Partnership completed an IPC analysis for  the Gaza Strip to inform critical humanitarian information needs. Country led IPC analyses are the cornerstone of the  IPC process and will continue to be so. In the case of the Gaza Strip, with the onset of the conflict and the subsequent  humanitarian catastrophe, there was a critical need for an IPC analysis. Without an active country Technical Working  Group, the IPC Global Partnership made use of its non-TWG led analysis process to inform decision-making around the  crisis in the Gaza Strip.  The analysis was conducted remotely from 26 February to 1 March by over 40 experts from 18 agencies, applying standard  IPC protocols, and made use of publicly available data from a wide range of courses on the conditions in the Gaza Strip  (see below). Based on IPC protocols, the level of evidence of this analysis was assessed as “Medium” (level 2) for each of  the three units of analysis. At the analysis completion, the Famine Review Committee was activated to review the Analysis  Team’s findings. Their conclusions were adopted by the Analysis Team.

The IPC is a set of tools and procedures to  classify the severity and characteristics of  acute food and nutrition crises as well as  chronic food insecurity based on interna - tional standards. The IPC consists of four mu - tually reinforcing functions, each with a set  of specific protocols (tools and procedures).  The core IPC parameters include consen - sus building, convergence of evidence,  accountability, transparency and compa - rability. The IPC analysis aims at informing  emergency response as well as medium  and long-term food security policy and pro - gramming. For the IPC, acute food insecurity is defined  as any manifestation of food insecurity  found in a specified area at a specific point  in time of a severity that threatens lives or  livelihoods, or both, regardless of the causes,  context or duration. It is highly susceptible  to change and can occur and manifest in a  population within a short amount of time,  as a result of sudden changes or shocks that  negatively impact on the determinants of  food insecurity. Contact for further Information IPC Global Support Unit   www.ipcinfo.org IPC Special Briefs are produced by the IPC  global initiative and do not necessarily  reflect the views of stakeholders in the  Gaza Strip. Classification of food insecurity and  malnutrition was conducted using the  IPC protocols, which are developed and  implemented worldwide by the IPC Global  Partnership - Action Contre la Faim, CARE,  CILSS, EC-JRC, FAO, FEWS NET, Global Food  Security Cluster, Global Nutrition Cluster,  IFPRI, IGAD, Oxfam, SICA, SADC, Save the  Children, UNDP , UNICEF, WFP , WHO and the  World Bank. Phase 1 None/Minimal Households are able  to meet essential  food and non-food  needs without  engaging in atypical  and unsustainable  strategies to access  food and income.Phase 2 Stressed Households have  minimally adequate  food consumption  but are unable  to afford some  essential non-food  expenditures without  engaging in stress- coping strategies.Phase 3 Crisis Households either: • have food  consumption gaps  that are reflected by  high or above-usual  acute malnutrition; or • are marginally able  to meet minimum  food needs but  only by depleting  essential livelihood  assets or through  crisis-coping  strategies.Phase 4 Emergency Households either: • have large food  consumption gaps  that are reflected  in very high acute  malnutrition and  excess mortality; or • are able to  mitigate large  food consumption  gaps but only  by employing  emergency  livelihood strategies  and asset liquidationPhase 5 Catastrophe/  Famine Households  experience an  extreme lack of  food and/or cannot  meet other basic  needs even after  full employment of  coping strategies.  Starvation, death,  destitution and  extremely critical  acute malnutrition  levels are evident.  For Famine Classi  cation, area needs  to have extremely  critical levels of acute  malnutrition and  mortality.Acute Food Insecurity Phase name and descriptionLimitations of the Analysis  Given the major access constraints, data on food security outcomes  was collected using Computer Assisted Telephone Interviews (CATI).  Quality concerns regarding the use of this methodology including the  representativeness, and potential biases associated with mobile network  coverage and ownership were discussed at length during the previous round  of IPC analysis (for data collected in November 2023). The Analysis Team  concluded that the data meets the requirements set by the IPC and were  the same for this analysis, especially considering the number of observations.  Through the efforts of partners, gaps in nutrition information were filled  through screening information. The high degree of volatility around the  conflict limits the ability to consider longer analysis periods. Scenarios on the  evolution of the conflict were developed in conjunction with conflict experts  to the best of their knowledge and expertise. <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF44 ENDNOTES 1 PCBS Labour Force Survey, 2022 -

  As part of the genocide being developed in Gaza by the State of Israel the people are suffering from rapidly increasing starvation. According to a recent
  <a href="https://www.ipcinfo.org/fileadmin/user_upload/ipcinfo/docs/IPC_Gaza_Strip_Acute_Food_Insecurity_Feb_July2024_Special_Brief.pdf">
   report
  </a>
  1.1 million people, half of the population of Gaza, are experiencing “catastrophic food insecurity”, the 5th and last phase of the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC). The whole population in Gaza, 2.23 million people are facing high acute food insecurity. The rest of the population is mostly in phase 4 “emergency” while some are in phase 3 “crisis”.

  In northern Gaza, the acute lack of food is far exceeding the threshold of famine, acute malnutrition has likely exceeded the threshold, and deaths from starvation are likely soon reaching the threshold of famine. According to a UN official the situation is headed toward more than

  Since the 7
  <sup>
   th
  </sup>
  of October 2023,
  <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/longform/2023/10/9/israel-hamas-war-in-maps-and-charts-live-tracker">
   every hour
  </a>
  in Gaza 15 people are killed, six of them children, 35 people are injured and 12 buildings are destroyed. In total at least 31,726 people have been killed by the State of Israel since the beginning of the current genocidal campaign. More than 73,792 people have been injured, more than 8,000 are missing, and half of Gaza’s homes have been destroyed or damaged.
 </p>
<p>
  While the imperialists are acting as if what is going on in Gaza is some kind of natural disaster, where the only thing they can do is try to give a little aid, what is happening is no mystery. Even officials of the Yankee-dominated UN
  <a href="https://twitter.com/UNHumanRights/status/1770068341551452168">
   imply
  </a>
  that the State of Israel is using starvation as a weapon of war.
 </p>
<p>
  The laws of war, which the imperialist regularly negate it unless it fits their interests, are clearly defined and well known to any soldier in any army. Grave breaches of these laws are considered war crimes.
  <a href="https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/en/ihl-treaties/gciv-1949/article-55">
   Article 55
  </a>
  of the Fourth Geneva Convention states clearly that the State of Israel is responsible for the needs of the people under its occupation:
 </p>
<p>
  “
  <em>
   To the fullest extent of the means available to it, the Occupying Power has the duty of ensuring the food and medical supplies of the population; it should, in particular, bring in the necessary foodstuffs, medical stores and other articles if the resources of the occupied territory are inadequate.
  </em>
  ”
 </p>
<p>
  The facts about the situation in Gaza stated above shows clearly that the State of Israel is committing a war crime by breaking this law.
 </p>
<p>
  On the 26
  <sup>
   th
  </sup>
  of January the International Court of Justice (ICJ) made a
  <a href="https://icj-cij.org/sites/default/files/case-related/192/192-20240126-ord-01-00-en.pdf">
   preliminary ruling
  </a>
  , which stated the following:
  <em>
   “The State of Israel shall, in accordance with its obligations under the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, in relation to Palestinians in Gaza, take all measures within its power to prevent the commission of all acts within the scope of Article II of this Convention.”
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  The British NGO Oxfam has
  <a href="https://www.oxfam.org/en/press-releases/israel-government-continues-block-aid-response-despite-icj-genocide-court-ruling">
   denounced
  </a>
  that despite the ICJ ruling the State of Israel is still deliberately blocking aid to Gaza. Among the ways the State of Israel is: blocking aid is creating choke points by only allowing aid via two crossings; imposing a bureaucratic inspection system which delays trucks for 20 days on average; and rejecting necessary supplies such as fuel, generators, protective gear and communication equipment, claiming that they can be used for military purposes.
 </p>
<p>
  By not only neglecting to provide the occupied population with nessesary supplies, but also blocking other parties from doing so, the State of Israel is also committing a war crime by breaking Article 23 of the Fourth Geneva Convention. This article requires States to “
  <em>
   allow the free passage of all consignments of medical and hospital stores
  </em>
  ” intended only for civilians and “
  <em>
   the free passage of all consignments of essential foodstuffs, clothing and tonics intended for children under fifteen, expectant mothers and maternity cases
  </em>
  ”. Paragraph 2 of
  <a href="https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/en/ihl-treaties/api-1977/article-70">
   Article 70
  </a>
  of the Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions broadens this obligation: “
  <em>
   The Parties to the conflict and each High Contracting Party shall allow and facilitate rapid and unimpeded passage of all relief consignments, equipment and personnel provided in accordance with this Section, even if such assistance is destined for the civilian population of the adverse Party.
  </em>
  ”
 </p>
<p>
  Paragraph 1 of
  <a href="https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/en/ihl-treaties/api-1977/article-54">
   Article 54
  </a>
  the Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions defines using starvation as a weapon of war as a war crime: “
  <em>
   Starvation of civilians as a method of warfare is prohibited.
  </em>
  ”
 </p>
<p>
  Furthermore Paragraph 2 of the Article states that: “
  <em>
   It is prohibited to attack, destroy, remove or render useless objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population, such as foodstuffs, agricultural areas for the production of foodstuffs, crops, livestock, drinking water installations and supplies and irrigation works, for the specific purpose of denying them for their sustenance value to the civilian population or to the adverse Party, whatever the motive, whether in order to starve out civilians, to cause them to move away, or for any other motive.
  </em>
  ” In Gaza 83% of groundwater wells are
  <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/longform/2023/10/9/israel-hamas-war-in-maps-and-charts-live-tracker">
   reported
  </a>
  to not be operational.
 </p>
<p>
  While ignoring the obvious war crimes committed by the State of Israel, the imperialists, acting like this is a natural disaster, tries to give the impression that they want to help the people of Gaza with insufficient measures such as their air drops. When these do not
  <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2024/2/28/palestinians-rush-into-the-sea-as-aircraft-drop-aid-into-gaza">
   fall in the sea

  </a>
  after failing to deploy parachutes, they are still a drop in the ocean for the starving Palestinians. German imperialism has
  <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/world/german-air-force-makes-first-aid-drops-over-gaza/ar-BB1k06rq">
   deployed two transport aircraft
  </a>
  for dropping aid in Gaza, however the aircraft can only carry 18 tons each. This is less than the capacity of a truck which carries around 20 tons. While the population of Gaza needs around
  <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/02/21/1232605200/humanitarian-aid-gaza-israel">
   500 trucks
  </a>
  of aid each day, only 2,874 trucks entered Gaza in February, less than 100 per day. The current trend is that the amount of aid is decreasing.

Since then, the conditions necessary to prevent famine have not been met and  the latest evidence confirms that Famine is imminent in the northern governorates and projected to occur anytime  between mid-March and May 2024. CURRENT:  15 FEBRUARY - 15 MARCH 2024             2.13M 95% of the population   analysed People facing high   acute food insecurity   (IPC Phase 3 or above) IN NEED OF URGENT  ACTIONPhase 5 677,000 People in Catastrophe Phase 4 876,000 People in Emergency Phase 3 578,000 People in Crisis Phase 2 96,000 People Stressed Phase 1 0 People in food  security PROJECTED:  16 MARCH - 15 JULY 2024             2.23M 100% of the population   analysed People facing high   acute food insecurity   (IPC Phase 3 or above) IN NEED OF URGENT  ACTIONPhase 5 1,107,000 People in Catastrophe Phase 4 854,000 People in Emergency Phase 3 265,000 People in Crisis Phase 2 0 People Stressed Phase 1 0 People in food  security    IPC ACUTE FOOD INSECURITY ANALYSIS   15 FEBRUARY - 15 JULY 2024   Published on 18 March 2024IPC Global Initiative - Special Brief IPC Special Briefs are produced by the IPC global initiative and do not necessarily reflect the views of stakeholders in Palestine. This analysis  factors in all data and information available up to 10 March 2024 and does not take into account the latest developments on the ground. Key Drivers Restricted humanitarian access Extremely limited humanitarian access to and within the  Gaza Strip continues to impede the safe and equitable  delivery of life-saving multi-sector humanitarian assistance  critical for Famine prevention and response. This includes  severe limitations to the supply of goods as well as basic  services.Hostilities Hostilities continue to involve the besiegement of the  entire population and widespread, intense and sustained  ground and air operations and clashes. This has caused  over 31,000 deaths and injured 73,000 people, displaced  about 1.9 million people, damaged or destroyed over half  of the buildings, and devastated assets and infrastructure  indispensable to survival, including across the food, health  and water systems.Current Acute Food Insecurity | 15 February - 15 March  Projected Acute Food Insecurity | 16 March - 15 July<br/><br/> According to the most likely scenario, both North Gaza and Gaza Governorates are classified in IPC Phase 5 (Famine)  with reasonable evidence, with 70% (around 210,000 people) of the population in IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe).   Continued conflict and the near-complete lack of access to the northern governorates for humanitarian organizations  and commercial trucks will likely compound heightened vulnerabilities and extremely limited food availability, access,  and utilization, as well as access to healthcare, water, and sanitation. The famine threshold for household acute food  insecurity has already been far exceeded and, given the latest data showing a steeply increasing trend in cases of acute  malnutrition, it is highly likely that the famine threshold for acute malnutrition has also been exceeded.   In North Gaza,  acute malnutrition (by Mid-Upper Arm Circumference - MUAC) moved from a pre-escalation estimated of 1 percent to 6.8  – 9.1 percent in January and 12.4 to 16.5 percent in February (weighted for children 6-59). Acute malnutrition (by MUAC)  among children 6-23 months old increased in the same period from 16.2 percent to 29.2 percent. The upward trend in  non-trauma mortality is also expected to accelerate, resulting in all famine thresholds likely to be passed imminently.   The southern governorates of Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis, and the Governorate of Rafah, are classified in IPC  Phase 4 (Emergency). However, in a worst-case scenario, these governorates face a risk of Famine through July 2024.  The entire population in the Gaza Strip (2.23 million) is facing high levels of acute food insecurity. From mid-March to  mid-July, in the most likely scenario and under the assumption of an escalation of the conflict including a ground offensive  in Rafah, half of the population of the Gaza Strip (1.11 million people) is expected to face catastrophic conditions (IPC  Phase 5), the most severe level in the IPC Acute Food Insecurity scale. This represents an increase of 530,000 people (92  percent) compared to the previous analysis. Between the current and the projection period, around 400,000 more people  are expected to slide into IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe). The rest of the population faces Emergency (IPC Phase 4) (854,000  people, 38 percent of the population) or Crisis (IPC Phase 3) (265,000 people, 12 percent of the population).  The escalation of the hostilities has caused widespread damage to assets and infrastructure indispensable to survival.  About 50 percent of buildings - and more than 70 percent in the northern governorates - have been damaged or  destroyed. This has included dwellings, shops and infrastructure, such as hospitals, schools, as well as water, sanitation  and other facilities. Assets and infrastructure necessary for food production and distribution have also been destroyed or  severely damaged, extremely limiting the functionality of the food system.  From a pre-escalation average of 500 trucks a day of which 150 carrying food, in the period between 7 October 2023 to  24 February 2024, only 90 trucks per day, of which only 60 carrying food, entered the Gaza Strip. Consequently, virtually  all households are skipping meals every day and adults are reducing their meals so that children can eat. In the northern  governorates, in nearly two thirds of the households, people went entire days and nights without eating at least 10 times  in the last 30 days. In the southern governorates, this applies to one third of the households. <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF3 CURRENT SITUATION MAP AND POPULATION TABLE                                                            (15 February - 15 March 2024 ) Population table for the current situation: 15 February - 15 March 2024 Note: A population in Phase 3+ does not necessarily reflect the full population in need of urgent action.

At 5,900 residents per square kilometre, one of the  most densely populated areas in the world even before the concentration of most of the population in only one of five  governorates, the Gaza Strip population is extremely reliant on the cross-border movement of goods and utilities like  electricity and water.  In 2022, the Gaza Strip faced an unemployment rate of nearly  45 percent 1 and, by September 2023, the poverty rate was at 60  percent 2, among a population that included nearly 70 percent of  refugees. 3 Due to severely constrained livelihood opportunities,  in 2022, over half of the population was relying on humanitarian  assistance as their main income source and about one-third on  casual labour, 4 with 70 percent of the population food insecure. 5  Conflict . As of 14 March 2024, the ongoing hostilities have  reportedly caused nearly 105,000 casualties within the Gaza Strip  – nearly 5% of the total population. 6 This includes over 73,000  people injured, about half of them women and children, and  over 31,000 deaths. The escalation of hostilities within the Gaza Strip began with  heavy bombardment on 7 October 2023. 7 On 27 October, major  ground operations and clashes reportedly began within the Gaza  Strip. 8 These started in the northern governorates and continued  through 23 November, with a humanitarian pause from 24  November through 30 November. 9 Hostilities subsequently  resumed at high intensity, with major ground operations and  bombardment by air, land, and sea. This included the continued  expansion of a ground operation in Khan Younis Governorate,  centred on Khan Younis city. 10 Another large ground operation began in Deir al-Balah  Governorate on 24 December 2023, 11 expanding across multiple  though not all refugee camps and urban areas in the governorate.  These operations were accompanied by continued clashes  among armed actors. Clashes in the northern governorates, especially some neighbourhoods of Gaza city like Zeitoun,  re-escalated in late February 2024. 12 Bombardment by air, land, and sea of all areas of the Gaza Strip has continued  throughout this period, intensifying particularly before and during major ground operations. Humanitarian access.  Conflict continues to place severe limitations on the ability of humanitarian organizations to deliver  life-saving food, nutrition, health, water, hygiene, sanitation and other life-saving assistance to the besieged population.  Commercial traffic is similarly impeded. Humanitarian access, and the ability of the most vulnerable populations to access  and participate in humanitarian activities safely is highly limited and uneven across the Gaza Strip. Once humanitarian  assistance and commercial goods enter the Gaza Strip, onward access to the northern governorates is extremely limited  and unavailable for extended periods, while access is relatively higher for the southern governorates, particularly Rafah  Governorate. While there has been improvement in access to the Gaza Strip relative to early October 2023, including  the opening of the Kerem Shalom crossing in Mid-December 2023, access to the Gaza Strip continues to fluctuate and  remains insufficient for meeting the basic needs of the overall population.  Severe limitations and attacks on humanitarian staff and assets forced major providers of humanitarian food and other  assistance to the northern governorates to suspend convoys to these areas, including the World Food Programme, on  20 February. 13 Since the previous IPC analysis on the Gaza Strip in December 2023, access denial increased significantly,  especially in the northern governorates. In January 2024, only nine humanitarian missions to the northern governorates  were facilitated, dropping to six missions in February. 14 Figure 1. Casualties in the Gaza Strip reported by the  Palestinian Ministry of Health as of 14 March 2024.  Source: Health Cluster<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF5 According to OCHA, constraints on humanitarian action throughout the Gaza Strip include direct strikes with explosive  weapons on humanitarian convoys, detention of humanitarian staff, road closures, checkpoints, and related blockages  or delays on main transportation corridors. Swarming of humanitarian convoys subsequently increased, including at  several hotspots throughout the Gaza Strip, such as immediately  after crossing Wadi Gaza into the northern governorates.  Physical access constraints further limit the movement of  humanitarian and commercial traffic, including road damage  from bombardment and traffic of heavy military vehicles as well  as the accumulation of an estimated 12,000 metric tons of debris  that may take up to four years to fully clear. 15  Displacement and Movement Restrictions. Displacement  continues to be driven by conflict. An evacuation order was  issued to the entire population residing north of Wadi Gaza  (1.1 million people) on 13 October, 16 followed by orders and  accompanying maps indicating to move as far south as Khan  Younis Governorate. 17 After the humanitarian pause on 24- 30 November 2023, new evacuation orders covering at least   30 percent of the entire Gaza Strip were issued. 18 The unilaterally  declared Al-Mawasi “Humanitarian Zone” was first announced  on 18 October 2023, however, humanitarian agencies did not  agree to the establishment of such zones. 19 The proposed area  has limited pre-existing services, with OCHA reporting there is  “almost no sheltering capacity” . 20  In addition to the closure of some of the main transportation corridors within the Gaza Strip, other movement restrictions  have also been announced, including a ban on movement from southern to northern governorates. 21 Additional  restrictions imposed on populations affect livelihoods and food access, such as a de facto prohibition on fishing and  movement within one kilometre of the border fence, which covers a significant proportion of farmland. 22 The movement  of livestock together with displaced populations has not generally been reported and livestock abandonment is likely  high.Map 1. Missions planned, facilitated and denied, October 2023 to Mid-February 2024. Source: OCHA Map 2. Distribution of IDPs staying in Collective  Centres. Source: Shelter Cluster<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF6 As new evacuation orders are issued alongside with continuation of bombardments  and ground operations, Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) are constantly moving  in search of safety. Most of them have moved south, largely to Rafah Governorate. 23  The population in Rafah has increased about five-fold as a result, rapidly rising from  276,000 pre-escalation to over 1.3 million as of February 2024. A large proportion of  the displaced population is from Gaza and North Gaza Governorates, which have  seen their population decrease by 84 percent and 75 percent respectively. 24 Rafah Governorate, which spans over 65 km 2, now hosts around 1.3 million people. 25  In Rafah, there are 35 UNRWA shelters hosting 882,800 people and another 30  informal shelters hosting 506,300 people, 26 corresponding to over 30 percent of  the population staying in shelters. The formal shelters managed by UNRWA are  overcrowded with severely limited access to safe Water, Sanitation and Hygiene  (WASH) and other services. People in informal shelters face even more difficulties  accessing health, food and non-food services. The lack of Non-food Items (NFIs)  provision in informal settlements has led people to set up makeshift shelters and  tents, which are subject to flooding on rainy days, further exacerbating the suffering  of displaced people. 27  Damages . Destruction and damage of buildings, particularly from bombardment  by air, land, and sea, is evident in all governorates of the Gaza Strip. According to  the recent satellite assessments, by late February 2024, at least 54 percent of all  buildings in the Gaza Strip were likely damaged or destroyed. The largest scale  destruction is in Gaza Governorate where more than 73 percent of buildings are  estimated to be destroyed, followed by North Gaza (70 percent), Deir al-Balah (44  percent), Khan Younis (52 percent) and Rafah (28 percent). 28 This has included  dwellings, shops and various types of infrastructure, such as hospitals, schools, and  other public buildings, as well as WASH infrastructure and storage facilities, among  others.  Food Availability Production . The escalation of hostilities and mass  displacements have caused food shortages and  unavailability throughout the Gaza Strip as the food system  and agriculture value chains have collapsed or are marginally  surviving through the informal market. A significant portion  of agriculture land, encompassing orchards, greenhouses,  and farmlands has suffered extensive destruction. According  to the UNOSAT, the percent of damaged agriculture land  has increased from 25 percent to 60 percent, between  November 2023 and January 2024.29  Extensive damage has been inflicted on the local food  system, including agricultural infrastructure. More than 300  home barns, 100 agricultural warehouses, 46 farm storages,  119 animal shelters, 200 farms, as well over 600 wells used for  irrigation have been destroyed, amongst other agriculture  facilities.30 According to the FAO damage assessment of  February 2024, damage to wells was found to be most  concentrated in the North Gaza and Gaza Governorates; and  in some areas, all the wells were damaged. Additionally, over  26 percent (336) of all greenhouses have been damaged  across all governorates. The governorates with the highest Map 3. Gaza Damage Mapping  26.02.2024.

Source: UNOSAT, 2023-2024<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF7 damage are Gaza (55 percent), North Gaza (48 percent), Khan Younis (35 percent), Deir al-Balah (20 percent) and Rafah  (16 percent). The Governorate of Khan Younis had the largest area of damaged greenhouses (149 hectares), followed by  Rafah (89 hectares). More than 40 percent (6,694 ha) of all croplands has been damaged since 7 October, with the highest reported damages  in Gaza (55 percent, 1,941 ha), Deir al-Balah (51 percent, 1,408 ha), North Gaza (45 percent, 1,402 ha), Khan Younis (33  percent, 1,492 ha) and Rafah (25 percent, 451 ha) Governorates. In terms of cropland type, 41 percent of irrigated land, 43 percent of orchards and 42 percent of rainfed land have been  damaged.31 The hostilities have not only led to the destruction of agricultural assets and infrastructure, they also resulted  in the displacement of populations away from agricultural land and constrained access for agricultural activities. Other assets and infrastructure necessary for food production and distribution have also been destroyed or severely  damaged, extremely limited the functionality of the food system. Although some local production, primarily of vegetables, is still ongoing, it is very  limited. Lack of access to land and destruction of crops are compounded by a lack of  access to essential agriculture inputs (fuel, seeds, fertilizers, pesticides).  Most livestock were abandoned during the large-scale displacement in October 2023.  Remaining livestock are being slaughtered or sold due to the lack of fodder and water  or due to the need for cash or other resources. Similarly, poultry lack animal feed, and  the availability of poultry meat and eggs is reduced throughout the Gaza Strip.  The comparison among the preliminary reports from the FAO Loss and Damage  assessment and the baseline figure from the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics  (PCBS), shows about 70 percent of livestock and other animals have been lost since 7  October 2024. Fishing production is largely halted due to the damage of boats, lack  of fuel and security/safe access. Some fishing is still happening, but it is only available  to those who still possess equipment and have access to fuel.  Food security assessments indicate32 that, due to the lack of food availability, some  households are resorting to eating wild foods. These range from mallow ( khebbayze  in Arabic) to unconventional food sources such as animal fodder and other unsafe  foods. Figure 2. Overview of the damage to agricultural land and infrastructure due to the conflict in the Gaza Strip as of 15 February  2024. Source: FAO<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF8 Imports . Between January and September 2023, a daily average of 150 food trucks entered the Gaza Strip. Between  8 October 2023 and 9 March 2024, this number decreased to an average of 65 trucks per day33 and the availability of  food commodities has dramatically declined. Since the escalation of the hostilities, the number of trucks allowed into  the Gaza Strip has been severely restricted, reducing the inflow of humanitarian assistance and preventing the entry of  commercial goods completely until 8 December 2023. Since then, there was an initial increase in the flow of food and  non-food commodities, facilitated through the opening of a second border crossing (Kerem Shalom).  However, in February, the flow of commodities decreased again and has been intermittent from late January through  February. The month of February in particular saw major variations highlighted in figure 3. The entry of humanitarian and commercial trucks into Gaza is significantly limited to the southern governorates, mainly  Rafah. Conversely, there are very few items reaching the northern governorates and other areas in the rest of the south of  Gaza Strip.34 OCHA estimates that less than 5 percent  of all the food trucks have reached North Gaza and  Gaza Governorates in the past four weeks, while 45  percent remained in Rafah and about 50 percent  reached Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis. An in-depth  analysis of the border crossing manifest allowed to  generate approximate kilocalories values per truck  and per unit of analysis then distributed per area,  using information provided by OCHA and the Food  Security Sector. This reveals that in most days, the  quantity of food translated in kilocalories entering  in Gaza has been extremely below the requirements  in North Gaza Governorates, and mostly half the  requirements in Rafah. The only areas appearing to  have benefited from an almost sufficient amount  of kilocalories (although irregular) are in Khan  Younis and Deir al-Balah Governorates (with higher  quantities in the later). This may suggest that most Figure 3. Reanalysis of food-only trucks entering Gaza through Kerem Shalom and Rafah border crossing. Source: UNRWA Figure 4. Reanalysis of the Kcal availability per unit of analysis.  Source: UNRWA, Gaza Supply and Dispatch  <br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF9 requirements in Rafah. Based on truck entries into the Gaza Strip from 21 October 2023 to 3 March 2024, the proportion of  average kilocalories per day (using a 7-day rolling average) has been consistently below the daily kilocalorie requirements  (calculated using demographic data considering variations by age and gender), with the exception of a short period of  time around mid-January.  A survey conducted by the World Food Programme (WFP)35 highlights that interviewed shop owners are faced with a  significant shortage of basic food items, with 81 percent indicating depletion. Furthermore, 19 percent highlighted that  the available food items are in short supply, and not expected to last more than a week. The formal market has been  heavily impacted with a non-functioning supply chain, and severely damaged shops. Consequently, the informal market  has surged. Informal markets, provide 1 or 2 types of foods (canned foods mainly), and are supplied by the beneficiaries  of assistance (selling or bartering). The WFP market monitoring indicates that most respondents have stocks inferior to 1  week or inexistent for the vast majority of the food commodities, with the exception of vegetables. All respondents have  exhausted dairy products.36 Despite the presence of at least a hundred bakeries in northern Gaza, few are able to operate due to significant challenges.  The main obstacle is the persistent shortage of flour, other bakery inputs, and fuel. In early January, WFP began supporting  12 bakeries in Rafah and Deir al-Balah.37 Access Market functionality. Informal markets now dominate both food and non-food item transactions across the Gaza Strip as  formal markets have collapsed following the depletion of stocks and damage to primary places of business. Selling and  buying is mostly taking place in the street along with potential barter activities. People, and more particularly vulnerable  groups, are increasingly facing protection risks to access markets with the lack of social order and high levels of food  insecurity. There is a risk associated to transporting and carrying food in the street, especially in Northern Gaza and  Gaza Governorates where people have resorted to going out in groups to buy food and/or carrying knives to protect  themselves. The scarcity of items is driving food prices up and reducing household purchasing power. The overall Consumer Price  index (CPI) was approximately 49 percent higher in December 2023 compared to the onset of the conflict; the CPI for  food and soft drinks was 76 percent higher.38  Food aid.  The flow of humanitarian assistance into and across the Gaza Strip continues to be severely disrupted. Between  1 January and 12 February 2024, 51 percent of aid missions planned for the north of Wadi Gaza and 25 percent of  those planned for the areas requiring coordination south of Wadi Gaza were denied access..39 In February, the UN and its  humanitarian partners planned only 24 missions to areas north of Gaza, of which six (25 percent) were facilitated. This  stands in stark contrast to January, when 61 missions were planned to the north, with nine (15 percent) facilitated.40Figure 5. Stocks availability at shops as of 21 January (% of respondents). Source: WFP<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF10 Based on data from UNRWA,41 the maximum number of trucks entering daily from both the Kerem Shalom and the Rafah  crossings was 300 (compared to an average of 500 daily pre-escalation), approximately 70 percent of these trucks carried  food or a mixture of food and non-food items. On 20 February 2024, WFP decided to suspend its food aid deliveries to  northern Gaza as a result of chaos and violence.42 On 5 March, a 14-truck food convoy, the first by WFP to the north since  it paused deliveries on 20 February, was denied access after a three-hour wait at the Wadi Gaza checkpoint and then  looted on its way back.43  On 7 March, 11 food trucks from private sector were allowed to enter. In total, from 5 February to 5 March, 10-15 food  trucks were allowed into the Gaza Governorate to feed about 300,000 people (less than 1 Kg per person for a full month).  Given the spread of the conflict, restrictions on movement and the displacement of the population, the humanitarian  space is constantly decreasing, and humanitarian food assistance is being distributed unequally among areas.  Airdrop operations of food aid along the Gaza Strip coastline began on 26 February 2024. Airdrops mainly consist of  ready-made meals that do not require cooking methods and are of high nutritional value. However, they are erratic,  small-scale, cover a limited geographic area, and are primarily accessible to populations located near the coast, including  those physically able to recover food pallets and packages from the sea in a context of heightened civil unrest. Airdrops  without ground coordination are also dangerous and falling assistance may strike civilians, as occurred on 8 March when Figure 6. Food CPI in Gaza Strip (December 2022 - December 2023). Source: WFP/ PCBS Figure 7. Inflation rate (September 2023 vs. December 2023). Source: WFP/ PCBS<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF11 OCHA reported that five civilians died.44 In  light of this, airdrops account for a negligible  share of the humanitarian food security  assistance in the Gaza Strip compared to  what is trucked in overland. Cash Assistance.  The functionality of cash  assistance in the Gaza Strip is limited. As of  15 February 2024, cash actors had delivered  emergency multi-purpose cash assistance  to over 125,000 households (over 828,000  people) since the onset of the conflict.45  According to the most recent Cash Post  Distribution Monitoring,46 about 71 percent  of the respondents reported that the cash  assistance received helped them to either  access urgent/basic items and services  needed. Most expenditures were on food (89 percent), followed by medicines, debt repayment, water and hygiene  products, and transportation. In Rafah, cash liquidity is a significant challenge47 because of the high number of displaced  individuals and the logistical difficulties banks face in transferring cash. Poor electricity supply and connectivity are also  affecting the ability of financial service providers to make cash accessible.   Figure 8. Planned aid missions by month. Source: OCHA  Figure 9a.

Challenges in use of cash, since 7 October 2023 and January 2024. Source: Cash Working Group Figure 10. Quantity of Diesel and Domestic Gas imported per day. Source: UNRWAUtilization  Before the escalation of hostilities, electricity was unreliable and only available for a few hours each day. The lack of  electricity negatively affected all aspects of life, including food safety, and made it almost impossible to operate food  processing units effectively.48 The main water and electricity networks, fuel and food supplies are now almost completely  suspended.49 Frequent communication blackouts make it extremely challenging to coordinate the distribution of aid,  and let people know how to access it, and when.  The complete electricity blackout that began on 11 October 2023 continues, with only limited electricity generated  inside the Gaza Strip from generators and solar panels. Hostilities in the Gaza Strip continue to prevent the delivery of fuel  to the Gaza power plant, which remains non-functioning, and block cross-border electricity distribution.50 This severely  impacts all aspects of daily life, including the processing and storage of food, pumping and distribution of drinking water,  treatment of wastewater, and the functionality of telecommunications and financial systems. <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF13 The lack of electricity and damage to telecommunication systems has also limited the ability of populations to  communicate and access information like evacuation orders or humanitarian assistance delivery. There have been rolling  telecommunication blackouts since 7 October, with several lasting around one week.51 Fuel was not permitted to enter the Gaza Strip from 7 October until 15 November 2023. UNRWA reported that for only  the bare minimum of critical services in which it is involved, 160,000 litres per day of diesel fuel are needed. This minimum  requirement, which is still insufficient for a full restoration of humanitarian operations and other basic services, has been  met only about 10 percent of days from 7 October through 9 March. No fuel was permitted to enter the Gaza Strip from  20 December 2023 through 7 January 2024, a period of new or expanding major ground operations, including in Deir  al-Balah and Khan Younis Governorates. From 24 January through 6 March, fuel was permitted to enter the Gaza Strip  only on alternative days.52 Even once inside the Gaza Strip, the onward movement of diesel fuel faces the same extreme  challenges as other humanitarian and commercial goods, with little fuel reaching the northern governorates. Regarding fuel to North Wadi Gaza, two (10 percent) of 21 planned missions were facilitated. Both deliveries were  facilitated to a single hospital, leaving other hospitals and WASH facilities without fuel. For fuel to areas South of Wadi  Gaza, 15 (71 percent) of 21 planned missions to areas requiring coordination were facilitated. A total of 300,600 litres were  delivered. However, convoys to Nasser hospital were denied access five times in a row. Fuel shortages in hospitals force  them to cease most operations and may lead to preventable deaths.53 About 250 tons of cooking gas entered the Gaza Strip per day on average from January to August 2023.54 Daily entry into  the Gaza Strip from 24 November 2023 through 10 March 2024 has consistently been roughly 30-40 percent of that pre- escalation amount.55 This has further challenged the ability of the Gaza Strip population to cook food that they are able  to access, presenting challenges to physical and biological utilization. As of January-February 2024, nearly 80 percent of  the population in all governorates reported using firewood as their primary cooking fuel, covering any form of wood  available. Around 10-15 percent of the population across governorates reported burning waste as their main cooking  fuel, while almost no respondents reported using cooking gas. Between 7 and 10 percent of respondents reported  that there was no cooking fuel available.56 This is a particular concern as these populations face major challenges with  consuming food that they may still have access to, in particular flour.  Stability Continued conflict and worsening acute food insecurity and nutritional status also contribute to civil unrest, which  further lowers the stability of all food security dimensions. Civil unrest is a major challenge to the delivery of humanitarian  assistance and to humanitarian staff, and hampers their ability to reach the people in need as well as for the most  vulnerable to access and make full use of assistance.  Recent deaths related to the airdrops and swarming of the trucks entering the Gaza Strip are key evidence of the level  of desperation and acute hunger among the people of Gaza. These also show that even a minimal degree of order to  facilitate access to food and other essential supplies, such as medicines, cannot be guaranteed, given the absence of  civil authorities or organized police. Social cohesion in Gaza is strained, exposing the most vulnerable, such as children  - particularly those who are unaccompanied, women, the elderly, the chronically ill and people living with disabilities to  extreme levels of food and water deprivation.   Food Security Outcomes The most recent WFP survey relied on data collected through Computer Assisted Telephone Interviews (CATI) between  6 December 2023 and 19 February 2024. The number of observations were: For North Gaza and Gaza Governorates: 104  observations; for Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah Governorates: 369 observations; for Rafah Governorate: 892 observations.  Households were randomly selected from a master list of 320,000 WFP pre-conflict beneficiary households representing  80 percent of the total pre-conflict population in the Gaza Strip. Overall, 10,320 households were selected and called.  Of them, 1,365 respondents completed the questionnaires (success rate of 13.3 percent - in line with the 10 percent  to 20 percent typical of CATI analyses in the region), while 19 (0.2 percent) answered the call but hung-up and did not  complete it. The rest did not answer.57<br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF14 Food Consumption Score (FCS). According to the survey, most households across the Gaza Strip have inadequate food  consumption with almost 88 percent of households in the North reporting Poor Food consumption (indicative of IPC  Phase 4 and 5, Emergency and Catastrophe) and 9 percent reporting Borderline food consumption (indicative of IPC  Phase 3, Crisis). An additional disaggregation of the FCS ‘poor’ category (&lt;14) shows that in the North Gaza Governorates,  36 percent of the respondents are not even able to eat cereals daily. In Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah around 53 percent of  households reported poor consumption and 31 percent reported borderline consumption, among them 11 percent had  a value below 14. In Rafah, around 48 percent of households reported poor food consumption and 31 percent reported  borderline consumption of which 5 percent had a value below 14.58 Across all governorates, the food consumption  gaps are clear as most households are unable to consume cereals daily. In the north, the mean number of days of cereal  consumption is 4.4 per week, in Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah Governorates and Rafah Governorate the mean number  of days is 5.14 and 5.15, respectively. Consumption of protein rich food is extremely low in Northern Gaza at 0.33 days a  week and a little over one day a week in the rest of the Gaza Strip.  Reduced Coping Strategy Index (rCSI). Results from reduced coping strategies index indicates that nearly 100 percent of  respondents in the Gaza Strip are engaging in extreme coping strategies. The indicator assesses the frequency with which  households resorted to coping strategies that altered their consumption patterns such as reducing meals, restricting  consumption by adults for children to eat, and borrowing food, in the previous week to cover gaps in their consumption.  Household Hunger Scale (HHS). An increase in the proportion of households facing extreme food consumptions gaps is  observed across all analysed governorates when compared with November 2023 data. About 84 percent of households  in Northern Gaza (Gaza and North Gaza) experienced ‘very severe hunger’ , indicative of IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe), while  8 percent of households reported ‘severe hunger’ , indicative of IPC Phase 4 (Emergency). Compared with the previous  survey round, the deterioration has been significant. In November the proportion of households with ‘very severe hunger’  was estimated at 40 percent showing a doubling of households facing extreme food consumption gaps indicative of IPC  Phase 5 (Catastrophe). In Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis Governorates, 57 percent of households reported experiencing  ‘very severe hunger’ , while 24 percent reported to experience ‘severe hunger’ , compared with November 2023 when only  22 percent of households faced ‘very severe hunger’ . In Rafah, the proportion households reportedly experiencing ‘very  severe hunger’ was 56 percent and 21 percent reporting ‘severe hunger’ .59 Livelihood coping. Some indirect evidence on livelihood coping mechanisms was collected focusing on emergency  strategies contextualised for the very specific conditions of Gaza. The data indicates the highest use of extreme coping  strategies in the North with 18 percent of households reporting that they bartered/exchanged clothing for food, while  12 percent reported begging for food. As estimated 3 percent reported scavenging due to lack of food, and 18 percent  reported gathering wild foods. Around 23 percent reported looting food from debris, and 74 percent indicated that  they sought food outside their shelter, facing potential security risks. In Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis, the reported  proportions were similar: 24 percent of households reported that they bartered/exchanged clothing for food, and in  Rafah the proportion was 27 percent. Around 7 percent in Khan Younis, Deir al-Balah and Rafah Governorates reported  begging for food. An estimated 1.8 percent reported scavenging due to lack of food and 15 percent gathering wild foods.  Around 5 percent in Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah Governorates, and 6 percent in Rafah Governorate reported looting  food from debris. Finally, 65 percent of the households in Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis Governorates, and 59 percent in  Rafah Governorate reported that they sought food outside their shelter facing potential security risks. The survey detected  a high level of non-applicable strategies, which might indicate the pure exhaustion of these coping mechanisms.  Household Economy Approach (HEA) Outcome Analysis (OA): Preliminary HEA Outcome Analysis was made available  by FEWS NET for this IPC analysis. For the northern governorates (North Gaza and Gaza urban area), for the period of  February – August 2024, all the wealth groups categories living in these governorates are expected to face high level of  Survival Deficits (SD), indicative of an IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe). The SD is calculated compared to a survival threshold  defined as the amount of food and cash income needed by the households to meet the 2,100 Kcal per day per person. This  also include the cost of preparing and consuming food plus any cash expenditure on water for human consumption.60  The only exception in these results appear for the Better Off (BO) wealth group living in the Semi Agriculture Gaza (SAG)  livelihood zone with livelihoods more related to crops sales, livestock sales or self-employment, that will experience SD  Indicative of an IPC Phase 4 (Emergency), at the limit of an IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe). For Southern Gaza, the level of  deficit for the projected period of April – August 2024 for the households living in urban areas (URB livelihood zone), will  be indicative of an IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe). For the households living in this governorate with livelihoods more related  to agricultural labour, crop and livestock sales or self-employment, (SAG livelihood zone) – that represent a small portion  of the population living in this governorate -, the Very Poor and the Poor wealth groups will face SD indicative of an IPC <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF15 Figure 11.

This last  deficit is calculated compared to a Livelihood Protection basket that include all the sources of food and income needed  for the households to maintain their local livelihoods.  Gender lens.  Food insecurity has a multidimensional impact on women, as it not only relates to unequal access to,  distribution of, consumption of, and control over food, but it also has long-term health and safety risks.  UN Women data  shows that the escalation in food insecurity has also increased the vulnerability of women to food insecurity. More than  4 out of 5 women (84 percent) interviewed by UN Women report that their family eats half or less of the food they used  to before the conflict  began, with mothers and adult women being those tasked with sourcing food, yet eating last,  less, and least than everyone else. Moreover, 4 in 5 women (84 percent) in Gaza indicate that at least one of their family  members had to skip meals during the past week. In 95 percent of those cases, mothers are the ones going without food,  skipping at least one meal to feed their children. Nearly 9 in 10 women (87 percent) report finding it harder to access food  than men. Some women are now resorting to extreme coping mechanisms, such as scavenging for food under rubble  or in dumpsters.<br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF16Area Governorate % of total Gaza populationURB LZ SAG LZ % of governorate HHs with kcal gaps indicative  of IPC 5 % of area (northern/southern) with kcal gaps  indicative of IPC 5Estimated % of population in the LZ  (URB) Very Poor (24% of the LZ population)  Survival Deficit (SD), Indicative IPC Phase Poor (33%) SD, Indicative IPC Phase Middle (41%) SD, Indicative IPC Phase Better Off (4%) SD, Indicative IPC Phase Estimated % of population in the LZ  (SAG) Very Poor (32%) SD, Indicative IPC Phase Poor (37%) SD, Indicative IPC Phase Middle (25%) SD, Indicative IPC Phase Better Off (7%) SD, Indicative IPC Phase SCENARIO 1 (FEBRUARY - AUGUST 2024) SCENARIO 1 (FEBRUARY - AUGUST 2024)Northern Gaza North Gaza5% 100%85%,  Phase 585%,  Phase 587%,  Phase 555%,  Phase 50% N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A 100,0%Gaza5% 94%85%,  Phase 585%,  Phase 587%,  Phase 555%,  Phase 56%86%,  Phase 587%,  Phase 584%,  Phase 549%,  Phase 4100%Southern Gaza Deir al Balah (or  middle Gaza)10% 99% N/A N/A N/A N/A 1% N/A N/A N/A N/ATo be  inferred To be inferred based on Khan Younis and Deir al Balah assumptions  and convergence of other data higlighting where and to what  extent conditions resemble Rafah vs. Northern GazaKhan  Younis21% 99% N/A N/A N/A N/A 1% N/A N/A N/A N/ATo be  inferredRafah59% 97%33%  survival  deficit,  Phase 432%  survival  deficit,  Phase 445%  survival  deficit,  Phase 427%  survival  deficit,  Phase 43%13%  survival  deficit,  100%  liveli - hoods  pro- tection  deficit,  Phase 30%  survival  deficit,  89%  liveli - hoods  pro- tection  deficit,  Phase 30%  survival/ liveli - hoods  pro- tection  deficit,  Phase 10% survival/ liveli - hoods  pro- tection  deficit,  Phase 10,0% SCENARIO 2 (APRIL - AUGUST 2024) SCENARIO 2 (APRIL - AUGUST 2024)simulation -  Rafah invasion 59% 97%67% 64% 63% 54% 3%42% 31% 0% 0%  Phase 5 Phase  5 Phase 5 Phase  5Phase 4 Phase 4 Phase 1 Phase 1<br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF17 NUTRITION SITUATION Inadequate dietary intake According to the Nutrition Vulnerability and Situation Analysis conducted by the Global Nutrition Cluster in December  2023-January 2024,61 in North Gaza, 98 percent of the children (47 observations) included in the analysis had consumed  two or fewer food groups in the 24 hours preceding the survey. Among the main food groups reported, breastmilk was  mentioned for 39 children (83 percent), and eggs for 17 (36 percent). The consumption of all the other food groups,  such as legumes, vitamin A rich fruits and vegetables, other vegetables, grains, meat and dairy products, had almost  completely disappeared from their daily diet, indicating an extremely worrying situation in terms of diet quality. 95  percent of the pregnant and breastfeeding women had consumed two or fewer food groups the previous day. The  main food groups mentioned were non-vitamin A rich vegetables, grains and eggs. This situation highlights critically  insufficient micronutrient intake before and during pregnancy and breastfeeding, which can affect both women and the  development of their infants.  In Khan Younis, 90 percent of young children and pregnant and breastfeeding women consumed two food groups or  fewer in the last 24 hours. For young children, the food groups most frequently mentioned were breastmilk and eggs,  while grains, pulses and eggs were the food groups most frequently mentioned for pregnant and breastfeeding women.  In Deir al-Balah, 86 percent of young children had eaten two or fewer food groups during the day before the survey, while  only 3 percent had consumed five food groups. The food groups most consumed were breastmilk, followed by eggs and  grains. Among pregnant and breastfeeding women, 67 percent consumed only one food group the day preceding the  survey, while 26 percent consumed two food groups. Pulses, grains and other vegetables were the food groups most  frequently mentioned by respondents.  In Rafah, 88 percent (UNICEF) – 89 percent (CATI) of young children had consumed two or fewer food groups within the  past 24 hours, breastmilk, eggs and grains were the main food groups consumed by young children. Only 3 percent had  eaten more than two food groups in the last 24 hours.  Infant and young child feeding practices Neonates face deteriorating nutritional status if mothers are unable to breastfeed due to stress, poor mental health and/ or inadequate breastfeeding privacy, and lack of counselling and support by healthcare providers.62 Further, the high pre- conflict prevalence of formula use among Gazans (58 percent among under six-month-old infants) raises concerns with  regards to potential supply disruptions. Under poor WASH conditions, keeping formula water, teats, and bottles sterile  is very challenging. These disruptions can result in increased incidence of diarrhoea and other infectious diseases, both  of which further exacerbate malnutrition. The prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding is projected to average between 25  percent to 35 percent under a ceasefire scenario (lower than the pre-conflict baseline of 42 percent, reflecting ongoing  disruptions including overcrowding and worsened mental health), falling to 20 percent to 30 percent under a status quo  scenario and 5 percent to 15 percent under the escalation scenario. These disruptions have enduring consequences on  infant and child health. Based on interviews that WFP conducted with eight key informants (four interviews were held  on 11 January, and the remaining interviews were conducted on 22-23 January), widespread weight loss, diseases, and  malnutrition prevail due to insufficient food supplies, intensifying the health crisis in the Gaza Strip.63  Health There are now only four hospitals and two clinics remaining in Gaza Governorate and two hospitals and two clinics in  North Gaza. All of them operate at a very low level and information on the health status of children under five is close to  absent. The survey conducted did not reach a minimum sample allowing exploitation of the information.  In Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah Governorates, according to the Nutrition Vulnerability and Situation Analysis, more  than 97 percent of children under five reported having had one or more diseases in the past two weeks. 56 percent  of the children under five had experienced Acute Respiratory Infections within the past two weeks, 70.5 percent had  experienced diarrhoea, and 82.3 percent had had a fever. This shows the extremely critical health conditions children  face, exposing them to high-risk nutritional deterioration. Trends from WHO corroborate these findings, showing a 55  percent increase in diarrhoea cases in children under five between November-December 2023. While the three hospitals  in the Governorate of Deir al-Balah were still operational in late November, nine of the 16 Primary Health Care Centres  (PHCCs) were no longer functioning, seriously impeding access to health services. On average, 0.49 litres of drinking water <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF18 was available per person per day in the households surveyed, which is far from the minimum humanitarian standard (2L/ person/day).35 The scale of needs is staggering with 100 percent of the 49 households in need of food and hygiene items,  78 percent in need of water, 69 percent shelter, and 65 percent health assistance.  In Rafah, the Nutrition Vulnerability and Situation Analysis also shows extreme health conditions with almost 93 percent  of children under five having one or more disease within the past two weeks, 79 percent had had a fever and 56 percent  had experienced vomiting. The level of diarrhoea is extremely critical with 70 percent of children under five having had  one episode in the past two weeks, and almost 60 percent having ARI (Acute Respiratory Infection).64  Since mid-October, 388,200 cases of acute respiratory infections have been recorded, along with 246,000 cases of diarrhea  and 3,300 cases of bloody diarrhea, 84,000 cases of skin rashes, 12,000 cases of Acute Jaundice (including confirmed  Hepatitis A).65 As per OCHA, 1.9 million IDPs face at high risk of communicable disease due overcrowding of IDP sites and  lack of access to proper water sanitation and hygiene facilities.66 In Gaza, cases of Hepatitis A have been confirmed in  January 2024 and WHO warned that inhumane living conditions will enable Hepatitis A to continue to spread.67  Health system functionality.  In February 2024, attacks against healthcare facilities, infrastructure and services continued  resulting in 58 percent of the hospitals are not functioning in the Gaza Strip, especially in the northern governorates  (75 percent of the hospitals not functioning). According to the Health Cluster, as of 5 March 2024, only 2 hospitals and  no Primary Health Care Centres were fully functioning; 14 hospitals and 20 Primary Health Care Centres were partially  functioning; while 23 hospitals and 62 Primary Health Centres were not functioning. Only 141 medical points in shelters  were available, while 264 informal, public and UNRWA shelters did not have a medical centre available.68 In the northern governorates, hospitals have been offering limited maternity, trauma, surgery and emergency care services.  They also face challenges such as a shortage of medical staff, including specialized surgeons, neurosurgeons, and intensive  care staff, as well as a lack of medical supplies, and have an urgent need for fuel, food, and drinking water.69 In Deir al-Balah  and Khan Younis, according to OCHA, since January 2024, three hospitals – Al Aqsa, Nasser, and Gaza European – were at  risk of closure due to the issuance of evacuation orders in adjacent areas and the ongoing conduct of hostilities nearby. In  Rafah, 5 hospitals are still functioning. The influx of IDPs migrating to Rafah has overwhelmed the bed availability in hospitals,  leading to insufficient capacity to meet the healthcare needs of the population. There is also high need for primary health  services in informal shelters hosting IDPs. The continued besiegement around some hospitals is significantly affecting their  case management capacity. Referring patients outside of Gaza remains a challenge, as the waiting list continues to grow.70 In addition, people are unable to effectively access healthcare due to the lack of laboratory equipment and reagents  needed for accurate diagnosis and testing.71 The risk to public health is intensified due to an acute scarcity of hygiene  materials and adequate sanitation infrastructure. Persistent anecdotal reports of Hepatitis A cases in Gaza, as recorded  by UNRWA and the Health Cluster, highlight ongoing concerns. Limited access to proper WASH facilities is hindering  prevention of diseases. The high number of surgeries and procedures has led to increased demand for anaesthetic and  analgesic medications which are in short supply. Blood and blood products in hospitals are needed for emergencies and  medical procedures to ensure that patients receive timely transfusions.72  Figure 1. Gaza disease surveillance Source: WHO, Health Cluster<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF19 UNRWA stocks of medicines continue to decrease, with around 15 days’ supply remaining overall and one week’s supply  of insulin; some items may run out sooner based on needs at shelters. Therefore, there is an urgent need to restock  medical supplies given the depletion of stocks in the local market. Stocks of fuel and medicines continue to be at risk  of depletion halting UNRWA operations at the health centres. Essential medicines and other critical medical supplies  remain difficult to bring into the Gaza Strip due to strict control of allegedly dual-use items at border crossings and wider  challenges with importing controlled drugs. As basic and specialty healthcare services in Gaza continue to deteriorate,  an increase in excess deaths due to traumatic injuries that would otherwise be survivable with timely and appropriate  care is expected.   In December 2023, UNICEF delivered 962,550 doses of essential vaccines, including for measles, pneumonia, and polio.  Opening of stabilization centres for acute malnutrition cases with medical complications are also planned notably in Tal  as Sultan (Rafah) and another in one of the field hospitals.73 Heightened insecurity and limited access to health facilities  continue to present major challenges for partners to respond and partner operations continue to be negatively affected  by the displacement of staff, social stresses and telecommunication challenges.74   Water, sanitation, and hygiene  Prior to the escalation of hostilities, the majority of the water supply in the Gaza Strip came from groundwater sources  and the rest (around 20 percent) from desalination plants and cross border pipelines. The over pumping of groundwater  in Palestine led to severe water pollution and salinization, especially in the Gaza Strip. More than 97 percent of the water  pumped from the coastal aquifer in the Gaza Strip did not meet the water quality standards set by WHO (PCBS and PWA,  2021).75 Figure 13.

WASH facilities damaged, February 2024. Source: WASH Cluster<br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF20 Nitrate levels already exceeded 150 mg/litre  in most areas of the Gaza Strip, which made  the water undrinkable, given the World Health  Organization (WHO) acceptable limit of 50  mg/litre.  In 2019, the daily allocation of water  per capita for domestic purposes was 77 litres/  capita in the Gaza Strip.77 Taking the high  percentage of water pollution in the Gaza Strip  and calculating the quantity of water suitable  for human use, the per capita share of fresh  water was 22.4 litres per day.78 Damage to WASH facilities.  Based on satellite  damage assessments on WASH infrastructure  dated 21 February,79 13 percent of all sewage  and water facilities have been destroyed (7  percent and 14 percent respectively), while  in total over 56 percent have been either  destroyed or damaged (13 percent and 34  percent respectively). Another 11 percent are  assessed to have possible damage. Overall, this  assessment identifies 77 facilities destroyed  and 254 facilities damaged, with another 67  facilities with possible damage. Northern  Gaza and Gaza Governorates have the highest  concentration of reported damaged or  destroyed infrastructure.  The functionality of, or access to, the 194  facilities (38 and 156 respectively) that were  found with no visible damage is conditional  to access to fuel and spare parts, which are  in very limited supply, as well as availability  of technicians and access to areas with  these assets. The combined damaged and  conditional access to the remaining WASH  infrastructure is expected to have a profound  impact on the availability of water, water  quality and presence of unsafe water or contaminants for populations in these areas. Water availability and drinking water. Water availability continues to be a major concern across the Gaza Strip. In  February 2024, the water produced from all the water sources in Gaza accounted for only 5.7 percent of the pre-escalation  production levels.80 According to OCHA, only 17 percent of the 284 groundwater wells are operating with limited hours  and 39 wells have been reported as destroyed and 93 as moderately to severely damaged.81 Still according to OCHA,  only one of the three cross border water pipelines is operating, functioning at 47 percent of its capacity. Plans to repair  the non-functioning pipelines face challenges in terms of access, communication, or repair coordination considering the  current context. The United Arab Emirate’s small desalination plant located on the Egyptian side of Rafah, operates at full  capacity, providing 2,400 cubic metres per day, following the construction of a 3-kilometre transmission line. In addition,  only two out of the three main water desalination plants are partially functional, mainly in the southern governorates.82   Water quality appears low due to lack of processing facilities or other way of contamination.  According to another study (sample size of 1,200 people)83 conducted in the Gaza Strip in February 2024, access to water  for drinking, bathing and cleaning, is estimated at 1.5 litre per person per day compared to the 15 litres minimum amount  of water required for survival as per as the international SPHERE standards. Similar results from the WASH cluster rapid  assessment conducted in 41 sites indicate a median value of 2 litres per person per day.84 Water production and distribution is a fuel intensive process and the overall WASH fuel allocation is currently 30,000 litres  per day. From 24 January through 4 March, the WASH sector in the Gaza Strip accounted for 30 percent to 60 percent Map 5. WASH facilities damaged, February 2024. Source: WASH Cluster<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF21 of all fuel entering the Gaza Strip, with limitations on diesel fuel entry a major impediment to meeting minimum water  requirements throughout the Gaza Strip, especially in the northern governorates.85 In the northern governorates, water supply remains limited and no access to clean water has been reported.86 According  to OCHA, as of 12 January 2024, the combination of water trucking, water from the functional desalination plant, and the  restoration of one of the three main water supply lines on 30 December 2023, has yielded only seven percent of water  production in Gaza, compared with the pre-October 2023 supply.87 In Rafah Governorate, according to the WASH cluster rapid assessment, the majority of the sites rely mainly on water  trucking and piped water in scattered sites, and collective centres rely more heavily on wells.88 More than half of the  sites provide water that is unsafe for drinking (67 percent in collective centres) and only 12 percent can provide water  treatment at source. According to the Euromed study, in Rafah Governorate out of the 15 litres minimum amount of  water a day required as per sphere standard, only 8 litres are available on average across sites (3 litres in collective centres),  with a median of 2 litres per person per day, indicating high level of disparities among sites. Hygiene.  According to the WASH cluster, in Rafah, 61 percent of the sites in collective centres and 71 percent in scattered  sites have no shower89 and the average number of showers per person is about 3,500 in collective centres and 1,050 in  scattered sites. Access and protection of most vulnerable population is also of high concern, with only 12 percent of the  showers being accessible for people living with disabilities and only 24 percent of the sites having separated showers for  women (14 percent in collective centres).  Figure 15. Quantity and type of water sources per site. Source: WASH cluster<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF22 An NRC assessment90 conducted in nine shelters in Rafah also stated that every assessed location had reported cases of  “hepatitis A, gastroenteritis, diarrhoea, smallpox, lice, [and] influenza.”  Solid Waste Management. In terms of waste management, most of the wastewater treatment systems have been  suspended and non-functioning since November 2023, due to damage, lack of fuel/power supply, and lack of  maintenance.91 Regarding solid-waste management, which was already a crucial issue before the escalation, the last  UNRWA update on 16 January states that solid waste management continues in Rafah and Khan Younis Governorates  and partially in Deir al-Balah Governorate, where approximately 45 truck loadings were transferred to temporary sites.92  However, according to the WASH cluster,93 93 percent of the sites (89 percent in collective centres and 100 percent in  scattered sites) have some type of visible waste, mainly solid waste or trash and 68 percent of all the sites present informal  or uncontrolled dumping areas. The accumulation of tens of thousands of tons of solid waste on the streets, around  hospitals, IDP shelters, and various random dump sites, represent high public health risks. The Gaza Municipality also  estimates that approximately 50,000 tons of solid waste remain unmanaged.94Figure 16. Quantity and type of water sources per site. Source: WASH cluster Figure 17. Waste management. Source: WASH Cluster<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF23 Sanitation. Sanitation situation continues to deteriorate and remains a major issue in all governorates. Despite significant  efforts by UNICEF and its partners to construct family latrines, sanitation coverage remains very low and efforts to increase  coverage are hindered by a lack of cement and other construction materials, including due to constraints on the entry of  items considered to be dual use into the Gaza Strip.95  With wastewater treatment plants non-functioning and many sewage facilities destroyed, especially in Gaza city, flooding  has been a major health hazard through the rainy period as floodwater mixes with untreated sewage in urban areas with  dense displaced populations.96 This is further compounded by the enduring fuel shortage, which impedes the operation  of remaining sewage stations and wastewater treatment plants. According to the WASH Cluster, there is also an increasing  concern about the potential for additional flooding of already contaminated rainwater harvesting lagoons, particularly if  rainfall intensifies. This situation poses a critical threat to both the environment and public health.97 In early 2023, UNICEF  reported that “insufficient safely managed water supply to households, poor sanitation, limited public WASH services, and  risk of flooding expose 1.36 million Palestinians to water-related diseases risks” .98 The situation is exacerbated by continuous restricted access to essential sanitation supplies and services in Gaza.99 The  inability to transport sufficient fuel into the Gaza Strip, and especially to the northern governorates, also significantly  compounds the challenges faced by the WASH response.100  A rapid assessment of displacement sites, including scattered sites and collective centres, in Rafah Governorate was  conducted by the WASH cluster in February 2024.101 63 percent of assessed sites reportedly had access to a sewer  connection (78 percent in collective centres and 36 percent in scattered sites). Few sites reported using buckets/plastic  bags, flush to open drain, septic tank, or flush to elsewhere as a sanitation facility. The median number of persons per  toilet across all sites was 341, though 994 in collective centres and 57 in scattered sites. 80 percent of the 41 sites had  non-functional latrines (74 percent in collective centers and 93 percent in scattered sites). Only 15 percent of sites had  handwashing facilities near latrines. 24 percent of assessed sites offered safe and private latrine access and 51 percent  had separate facilities for men and women. Sanitation facilities in collective centres and informal sites are overcrowded also due to the high number of displaced  populations. According to UNRWA, on average, there are 1,109 IDPs per toilet in shelters in Rafah Governorate, 619 IDPs  per toilet in shelters in Deir al-Balah Governorate, and 1,349 IDPs per toilet in Khan Younis Governorate.102 UNRWA also  reports that there are at least 486 people per toilet in UNRWA shelters in Rafah Governorate.103 Figure 18. Sanitation quantities. Source: WASH Cluster<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF24 Figure 19. Sanitation facilities. Source: WASH Cluster Summary of Acute Malnutrition Drivers  According to the Nutrition Vulnerability Study,104 conducted by the Global Nutrition Cluster, over 90 percent of children  aged 6-23 months and pregnant and breastfeeding women are eating two or fewer food groups each day, often those  of the lowest nutritional value. At least 90 percent of children under five have had at least one infectious disease, with 70  percent having had diarrhoea in the previous two weeks. Against a minimum standard of 15 litres per person, 81 percent  of households lack safe and clean water, with average daily household access to water reportedly less than one litre per  person per day. This extreme lack of safe water access is especially concerning for the greater number of infants now  reliant on infant formula than before the most recent escalation. Low clean water availability and access further exposes  young children to infection and subsequently malnutrition. Figure 20: Acute malnutrition drivers. Source: Global Nutrition Cluster<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF25 Nutrition Outcomes There is very limited data on acute malnutrition available in Gaza since the start of the conflict on 7 October 2023. The  only data that is available on acute malnutrition as of 9 Mar 2024 come from Mid-Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC)  screenings conducted in the three IPC AFI units of analysis, i.e. northern, middle and southern governorates. While some  screenings included children 6-59 months, others almost exclusively measured only children between 6 and 23 months  of age. Additionally, although some screenings contained individual MUAC and age data, others only had MUAC data at  aggregate level. Of the screening data made available for the analysis, one set only included 45 children and therefore  was not considered in the analysis. The remaining screening datasets were analysed as follows: Figure 21. Metadata, MUAC screening results. Source: Various - reanalysis conducted by the Global Smart Team For every screening that contained only aggregate MUAC data on children 6-59 months, first, unweighted prevalence  estimates were calculated for the following age groups: (i) 6-59 months, (ii) 6-23 months, and (iii) 24-59 months. Secondly,  weighted prevalence of MUAC among children between 6-59 months were calculated from the unweighted prevalence  estimates of children 6-23 months and 24-59 months by applying weights of 0.33 and 0.66,105 respectively. Finally, the  weighted prevalence estimates of 6-59 months were compared with the IPC Acute Malnutrition (IPC AMN) reference  table and the IPC AMN Phases were determined. For each screening that only contained aggregate MUAC data on children 6-23 months, the MUAC prevalence of children  between 23-59 months and weighted prevalence of MUAC among children 6-59 months were estimated using the  following procedure. First, using data from screenings that contained MUAC data on children 6-59 months, the ratio  between the MUAC prevalence of 6-23 months and 24-59 months was determined (this ranged from 3.07 to 9.68).  Secondly, using sensitivity analysis, expected ranges of MUAC prevalence among children between 24-59 months were  calculated using the lowest (3.07) and the highest (9.68) empirically observed ratios. Thirdly, a weighted analysis was  performed, and a range of weighted prevalence estimates of children 6-59 months were obtained. Finally, the weighted  prevalence estimates of 6-59 months were compared with the IPC Acute Malnutrition (IPC AMN) reference table and the  possible IPC AMN Phases were determined.<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF26 In conclusion:     •   In North Gaza Governorate , MUAC screenings are indicative of an IPC Acute Malnutrition Phase 2 - 3 (Alert  - Critical) in January, having rapidly deteriorated to an indicative IPC AMN Phase of 4 - 5 (Critical - Extremely  Critical) in February 2024.     •   In Khan Younis Governorate, MUAC screenings are indicative of an IPC Acute Malnutrition Phase 3 - 4 (Serious -  Critical) in February 2024.      •   In Deir al-Balah Governorate, MUAC screenings are indicative of an IPC Acute Malnutrition Phase 1 - 2 (Acceptable  - Alert) in February – early March 2024.      •   In Rafah Governorate, MUAC screenings are indicative of an IPC Acute Malnutrition Phase 1 - 2 (Acceptable - Alert)  in late January – early March.

The data available consisted in death counts issued by the Gaza Ministry of Health  and reported by the Health Cluster, and interview data collected during CATI surveys conducted by WFP . Furthermore, a  study on mortality and public health106 was conducted to inform humanitarian and other decision-makers working on  the Gaza crisis by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and the Center for Humanitarian Health at Johns  Hopkins University (LSHTM).  The mortality data collected by the Ministry of Health are not disaggregated by area and appears to only be those  attributable to conflict related violence. The WFP CATI survey data results can be disaggregated by area but not by cause  of death. Therefore, no direct measurements of CDR or U5DR after trauma exclusion are currently available. Nonetheless, it worths noticing that the modelled projections published by LSHTM, while considered useful for  indicating the expected direction of travel and scale of the expected excess mortality, the IPC Famine Review Committee  (FRC) found some of the assumptions factored in the study published in early February might have evolved in different  directions, especially regarding food intake estimates and acute malnutrition.   The absence of usable mortality data in  both governorates leaves a high degree of uncertainty on the translation of these acute malnutrition rate into children  and adult mortality in the current period in North Gaza. It is likely that these extreme levels of malnutrition have not yet  translated into 2/10,000/day Crude Death Rate. The likelihood of having surpassed U5DR thresholds (4/10,000/day for  children) is higher but impossible to ascertain. <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF28 PROJECTED SITUATION MAP AND POPULATION TABLE                                                            (16 March - 15 July 2024 ) Note: A population in Phase 3+ does not necessarily reflect the full population in need of urgent action.

Famine is imminent and likely to occur within the next two months.  The Governorates of Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis, and the  Governorate of Rafah, are classified in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency).   During the projection period (16 March - 15 July), in the most likely  scenario and under the assumption of an escalation of the conflict  including a ground offensive in Rafah, half of the population of  the Gaza Strip (1,107,000 people) is expected to face IPC Phase 5  (Catastrophe), the most severe level in the IPC Acute Food Insecurity  scale. The rest of the population is likely to be either in Emergency (IPC  Phase 4) (854,000 people, 38 percent of the population) or in Crisis  (265,000 people, 12 percent of the population). During this period, the  whole population of the Gaza Strip (2,230,000 people) will face high  levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above). North Gaza and Gaza Governorates In the most likely scenario, the North Gaza and Gaza Governorates  are classified in IPC Phase 5 (Famine), with reasonable evidence.  Famine is imminent and likely to occur within the next two months.   In terms of magnitude, 70 percent of the population is likely to be in  IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe) and 30 percent in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency). Continued conflict and the near-complete lack of access to the  northern governorates for humanitarian organizations and commercial  trucks will likely compound heightened vulnerabilities and extremely  limited food availability, access, and utilization, as well as access to  healthcare, water, and sanitation services. People’s ability to exit the  northern governorates and move to locations with relatively greater  food availability and access is likely to be very limited. Within the north, displacements are likely to remain frequent and  localized; yet conditions in the shelters will continue to deteriorate,  including extreme deprivation of basic needs.  As food stocks or sources (wild foods, livestock, or other types of food  – from domestic stocks, shelters or agricultural assets) will continue to  reduce, food availability is expected to be limited. With the very few  humanitarian and commercial trucks entering these governorates,  it is unlikely that households will be able to restock or stabilize their  food consumption patterns. Due to scarce food availability, the vast  majority of markets are either not functioning or availing very few Assumptions for the most likely scenario  in North Gaza and Gaza Governorates Conflict:  In the most likely scenario, the pop - ulation will likely remain fully exposed and  highly susceptible to conflict. Conflict and  related casualties will likely continue at simi - lar levels to January-February 2024, including  the wider besiegement, neighbourhood-lev - el clearing operations, occasional armed  actor clashes, and a comparable rate of  bombardment (air, land, sea). Basic services  infrastructure will likely remain extremely de - graded, and the proportion of all buildings  damaged or destroyed will likely continue to  steadily approach 100%. Humanitarian access to provide food, water,  medicines, and provision of health and  WASH services:  The northern governorates  are likely to be mostly inaccessible and  intermittently hard-to-reach, given continued  ground operations, bombardment (air, land,  sea), civil unrest, bureaucratic impediments,  and physical obstruction. The humanitarian  space in the northern governorates will  continue to be extremely restricted, thereby  hampering the provision of the necessary  supplies and services to the most vulnerable  population. It will also hamper the capacity  of humanitarian actors to monitor closely  the situation on the ground and to intervene  promptly to provide relief.  Civil unrest: Civil unrest will likely continue  to worsen, including due to intense and  widespread conflict, largely insufficient  basic service provision and humanitarian  assistance delivery. This will increasingly  inhibit the transport, distribution, and  utilization of humanitarian assistance within  the Gaza Strip. Displacement: Displacement will likely  remain frequent and localized and conditions  in shelters will continue to deteriorate,  including extreme deprivation of basic needs. food commodities at excessively high prices. As a result, communities’ coping capacity and social cohesion will be further  strained. Social tensions are also likely to increase putting the most vulnerable at higher risk of exposure to violence and  lower access to food. Physical access to markets is also of concern, due to restrictions of civilian mobility and conflict  intensity. Utilization of food resources will also be heavily impacted as seasonal higher temperatures reduce food storage  options in a context of no or extremely limited access to electricity, fuel and/or gas to preserve, process or cook food.  The lack of access to sufficient and safe water, sanitation facilities and health services is likely to increase the risk of cholera  and the spread of infectious diseases impacting people’s nutrition and health status and increasing mortality from non- trauma related causes. The restoration of public services will be a major challenge given that the majority of WASH  facilities and infrastructure are damaged or destroyed. <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF30 FRC analysis of acute malnutrition trends A detailed analysis of the drivers (risk factors) for acute malnutrition and the available data on nutritional status was provided by  the Global Nutrition Cluster report on Nutrition Vulnerability in February 2024.7 Based on this report and their own analysis the  IPC Analysis Team concluded that the key driver of acute malnutrition in the North Gaza governorate was the highly inadequate  dietary diversity in Children 6–23m, with 79% consuming ≤2 food groups, 8 and also in Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women,  with 95% consuming ≤2 food groups. The main food groups mentioned were non-vitamin A rich vegetables (24 affirmations),  grains (20) and eggs (17). This situation highlights critically insufficient diet diversity and micronutrient intake before and during  pregnancy and breastfeeding, which can affect both the women and the development of their infants. Infant and Young Chil - dren Feeding practices are highly constrained by the lack of resources and health seeking behavior is also highly constrained.  Interviews conducted by the FRC with key informants and a review of available reports confirmed that the situation in the  northern governates during the current analysis period was similar to that reported by the Analysis Team. The health and WASH  situations are also considered separately belo w. Figure 23: Trends in GAM by MUAC Prevalence in North Gaza (children aged 6-59 mo.) Within the IPC unit of analysis, MUAC screening data9 was available from the North Governorate but not from Gaza City. The  available data was collected as part of a vaccination programme and measurements were only taken from children aged 6-23  months. The FRC explored different methods for using this data to estimate the prevalence of GAM by MUAC in children aged  6-59 months. This was a necessary step to allow the classification of malnutrition according to IPC Phases. To provide a starting point for the trend analysis the prevalence of GAM by MUAC in North Gaza in 2023, before October 7th,  was estimated at 1%. This is consistent with previous studies.11 Age-adjustment of the MUAC screening data resulted in a GAM  by MUAC prevalence in January 2024 of 6.8% to 9.1%. By February this had risen to give a range of 12.4% to 16.5%, indicating a  very steep increase in the incidence of acute malnutrition in children 6-59 mo. To estimate what the prevalence would be at the  time of the current analysis in March 2024, two nowcasting scenarios were examined.  Given the extremely poor situation regarding the drivers of malnutrition, the best-case scenario was that there had been a  continued linear increase in prevalence, while the more likely scenario was that the rate of increase would have followed the  observed trend and have increased further in the time since the February screening. These two scenarios were then applied to  the high and low estimates for age-adjusted GAM by MUAC prevalence, resulting in the four dotted lines shown in Figure 2. This  analysis indicates that in all scenarios the GAM by MUAC prevalence had passed the IPC Phase 4/5 threshold (Critical/Extremely  Critical) in the current analysis period. Given the current trajectory in MUAC prevalence data it is clear that the Famine threshold  for acute malnutrition prevalence, measured using weight-for-height Z-scores, may have already been crossed or will be crossed  imminently. These data were collected exclusively in North Gaza governorate.Healthcare availability and access will likely continue to decline, including due to lack of humanitarian access and  inadequate delivery of critical supplies, as well as a decline in the functionality of the few remaining health centres. The risk  of infectious diseases will likely continue to increase due to the extreme deterioration of the overall health environment.  In line with the Famine Review Committee findings, people’s livelihoods and food consumption are likely to continue  deteriorating, resulting in more than two thirds of the population (70 percent) in IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe). Acute Malnutrition will increase at a high pace as already observed in the past few weeks (current period) and  mortality levels will likely breach the Famine thresholds (extremely critical) - by the end of May 2024.<br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF31 Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis Governorates These Governorates are projected to remain in IPC Phase 4  (Emergency), though with half of the population (300,000  people) in IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe), up from 30 percent in the  current period; and the other half (300,000 people) in IPC Phase 4  (Emergency). While this unit of analysis includes both Governorates,  the conditions for the population in Khan Younis Governorate are  expected to be worse than those in Deir al-Balah.  The onset of a major ground operation in Rafah Governorate will  likely be a major driver of deterioration in Khan Younis and Deir  al-Balah Governorates, including through an influx of displaced  populations – many already displaced multiple times – into parts  of these Governorates and the impact of the ground operation  on humanitarian access. Ground operations are likely to continue  throughout Khan Younis Governorate and in eastern Deir al-Balah  Governorate.  Displacement will likely escalate with large populations moving into  the Al-Mawasi area of Khan Younis Governorate and into Deir al- Balah Governorate, especially in and around Deir al-Balah city and  camp. Further displacement will likely stress already highly limited  resources and basic services, exacerbating existing conditions. Shelter  conditions are likely to deteriorate with continued deprivation of  basic needs.  Food availability and access are expected to further decline as the  major ground operation in Rafah Governorate reduces humanitarian  and commercial traffic into and throughout the Gaza Strip. This will  be exacerbated by continued civil unrest outside the Kerem Shalom  crossing, which will likely further reduce humanitarian and commercial  truck entry. Fewer humanitarian convoys to these governorates are  expected, including those unsuccessfully attempting to reach the  northern governorates and offloading assistance in Deir al-Balah  instead.  The already limited agricultural production, mostly of vegetables,  observed in the current period will likely continue to decline as  ground operations are pursued within and near production areas of  both governorates, especially in all areas of Khan Younis Governorate;  and the harvest period for several vegetables comes to an end.  Market functionality is likely to continue falling as agricultural  production and humanitarian and commercial truck arrivals decline.  Civilian mobility is likely to be severely constrained, further reducing  access to food, including through coping strategies like gathering  wild foods or scavenging. The end of the typical rainy period may also  limit wild food availability. Compared to other governorates, Deir al-Balah Governorate had  higher food availability in the current period, including due to higher  deliveries of humanitarian food assistance (proportional to estimated Assumptions for the most likely  scenario in Deir al Balah and Khan  Younis Governorates Conflict:  Conflict and related casualties will  likely continue at similar levels to February  2024, including ground operations in mul - tiple but not all urban areas of Deir al-Balah  and throughout Khan Younis governorate,  frequent armed actor clashes especially in  Khan Younis governorate, and a compa - rable rate of bombardment (air, land, sea).  The wider besiegement of the Gaza Strip  will likely continue. Humanitarian access: Humanitarian  access to Khan Younis and Deir al Balah  governorate - including for the delivery  of life-saving multi-sector assistance to  the most vulnerable populations - is likely  to be intermittently reduced, especially  relative to the higher proportional  delivery of assistance made to Deir al- Balah Governorate compared to other  governorates in early 2024. This decrease  in access is likely due to the onset of major  ground operations in Rafah Governorate,  continued ground operations in Khan  Younis governorate, bombardment (air,  land, sea) in these governorates and within  Deir al-Balah Governorate, and worsening  civil unrest.  Civil unrest: Civil unrest will likely escalate,  driven by intense and widespread conflict  as well as largely insufficient basic service  provision and humanitarian assistance  delivery. This will likely increasingly inhibit  the transport, distribution, and utilization  of humanitarian assistance throughout the  Gaza Strip.  Displacement: Displacement will likely  escalate, with large populations moving  into the Al-Mawasi area of Khan Younis  governorate and into Deir al Balah  governorate, especially the area of Deir al  Balah city/camp. Shelter conditions will  likely continue to deteriorate, including  extreme deprivation of basic needs,  extreme overcrowding, and increased  sheltering in open spaces. population) in parts of January and February 2024. These deliveries appear to have partially resulted from the offloading  of humanitarian food assistance that could not be delivered to the northern governorates. Any accumulated stocks in  markets and households will provide at least a short-term buffer to some of the people in the early part of the projection  period. Khan Younis Governorate received lower levels of humanitarian food assistance during that period, resulting in  households likely to face larger food consumption gaps from the beginning of the projection period. With no major  improvements in the availability of electricity, fuel, cooking gas, and safe water, food utilization will likely be a major  limiting factor in Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah Governorates. This includes challenges to the safe storage and preparation <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF32 Assumptions for the most likely scenario  in Rafah Governorate Conflict:  Conflict will likely escalate, in - cluding the continuation of the wider  besiegement, the onset of a new, major  ground operation throughout Rafah gov - ernorate and concentrated on Rafah city,  with armed actor clashes, and an increase  in bombardment (air, land, sea). Humanitarian access: Humanitarian  access to Rafah Governorate, including  for the delivery of life-saving multi- sector assistance to the most vulnerable  populations and data collection, will  likely be intermittently reduced, though  without total access loss to the Rafah  Governorate portion of the Al-Mawasi  area, where an extreme concentration of  displaced people is likely. Loss of access  will be particularly high to populations  remaining within Rafah city during the  major ground operation likely to occur  there. This disruption will likely result from  the onset of major ground operations in  Rafah Governorate, continued ground  operations in Khan Younis Governorate,  intensified bombardment (air, land, sea),  and civil unrest.  Civil unrest: Civil unrest will likely continue,  including due to intense and widespread  conflict and severely insufficient basic  service provision and humanitarian  assistance delivery. This will continue to  inhibit the transport, distribution, and  utilization of humanitarian assistance  within the Gaza Strip. Displacement: Displacement will likely  increase substantially, with most of the  current population of Rafah city forced  into the Al-Mawasi area of Rafah and Khan  Younis Governorates and into Deir al-Balah  Governorate, especially the area of Deir al- Balah city/camp. Conditions in shelters will  likely continue to deteriorate, including  extreme deprivation of basic needs,  extreme overcrowding, and increased  sheltering in open spaces.of food, lack of safe access to water, and an increasing incidence of infectious diseases, including diarrhoea, among the  general population. Full resumption of cross border water pipeline activity is unlikely, and the functionality of remaining wells and water  distribution systems will likely decline. Wastewater treatment plants are likely to remain non-functioning. Solid waste  management will continue to be limited. Healthcare availability and access will likely continue to decline, including  due to lack of humanitarian access and inadequate delivery of critical supplies as well as a decline in the functionality of  remaining health centres. Infectious disease risk will continue to increase due to the extreme deterioration of the overall  health environment. Low and declining food availability, access, and utilization will likely  lead to extreme gaps in food consumption and a collapse of coping  capacities for the estimated 300,000 people (50 percent of the  population) experiencing IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe); while  large food  consumptions gaps are expected for the 300,00 people (50 percent of  the population) in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency).  With the drivers of acute  malnutrition expected to worsen (infectious diseases expected to  increase, dietary diversity still severely restricted), the nutritional status  of the people of Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis will likely continue  to deteriorate towards critical levels of acute malnutrition (IPC AMN  Phase 4) during this period.  Rafah Governorate The onset of a major ground operation in Rafah Governorate will  likely drive a significant increase in acute food insecurity alongside  other severe humanitarian consequences. The situation is projected  to remain in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency), though with nearly half (45  percent) of the population (around 600,000 people) in IPC Phase 5  (Catastrophe), up from 25 percent in the current period. The whole  population of Rafah will likely be in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis) or above,  including over one third (about 464,000 people) in IPC Phase 4  (Emergency) and 12 percent (about 265,000 people) in IPC Phase  3 (Crisis). Relative improvement in access into and within Rafah have been  observed compared to the previous analysis, with the opening of a  second border crossing in Kerem Shalom allowing more humanitarian  and commercial supply for aid and markets, However, for the projection  period, considering the most likely scenario of a major ground operation  in Rafah, the humanitarian access and space are likely to reduce due  to the escalating hostilities and populations will face continued and  repeated displacement in search of “safer” areas. As many IDPs already  face poor food security, nutrition, health and WASH outcomes, further  displacement will likely cause further deterioration. Existing mitigation  measures from humanitarian services or programmes are likely to be  disrupted by conflict or sizeable displacements and may cause further  family separation or marginalization of the most vulnerable. Local production will be minimal and difficult to access and agricultural  activities (crop production, livestock herding or fishing) will either not  be pursued or remain very limited due to lack of agricultural inputs,  access to assets or land and geographical concentration of displaced  populations. Further disruptions to market supplies and prices are likely  to continue and decrease access to food through markets. Markets or  traders may be displaced along with the population, impacting their  ability to restock or remain functional, especially as populations move  further away from border crossings and fewer trucks enter the Gaza <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF33 Strip. Market-based interventions will continue to be challenged by high levels of displacement, including of the staff of  financial service providers, and a wider loss of enabling condition, including an adequate electricity supply and functional  telecommunications services, physical cash availability and access, and functioning markets able to absorb any rapid  increases in demand. Physical access to humanitarian assistance and markets will be hindered. There will likely be a disruption in social support  systems (e.g. community kitchens) and increased tensions within the community. Rising temperatures and declining access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene will likely lead to challenges in safe food  storage and preparation, and a rise in waterborne diseases or food borne illnesses. Scarcity of firewood will force people  to resort to using unsafe materials, increasing health risks. Explosive remnants will raise concerns about personal, food  and water safety.  Health outcomes and morbidity are expected to deteriorate in this period and even more so with increased overcrowding,  further displacement and/or lower access to health services. A major decrease in food availability, access, and utilization will likely cause extreme gaps in food consumption and  the exhaustion of people’s coping strategies. Acute malnutrition is likely to increase towards IPC AMN Phase 3 (Serious)  as food insecurity, the health environment, and infant and young childcare and feeding practices deteriorate due  to conflict escalation, displacement, and reduced delivery of, and access to multi-sector humanitarian assistance.<br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF34 COMPARISON WITH THE PREVIOUS ANALYSIS In comparison to the previous analysis (projection period December 2023 – 7 February 2024), the total share of the  population in IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe) across the Gaza Strip continues to increase, from 26 percent to 30 percent in  the current period (mid-February to mid-March 2024) and 50% in the projection period (mid-March to mid-July). In the  northern governorates, the share of the population in IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe) increased from 30 percent to 55 percent  in the current period and 70% in the projected period, representing an increase of about 100,000 people and 530,000  people, respectively.

HHS trends in the Gaza Strip<br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF36 RISK OF FAMINE ANALYSIS As per the IPC tools and technical guidance, an IPC statement on the risk of Famine differs from a Famine classification.  While a projected Famine classification is based on the most likely scenario, the risk of Famine refers to the worst case  scenario that has a reasonable and realistic chance of happening. The risk of Famine is only a statement and not a  classification and was designed to complement the standard IPC projections of the most likely scenario by providing  insights of a potential Famine if prospects evolve in a manner worse than anticipated. The elements considered when developing the worst case scenario are described below.  Factor/element Risk of Famine Scenario - Deir al-Balah and  Khan Younis GovernoratesRisk of Famine Scenario – Rafah Governorate Primary Drivers ConflictConflict would escalate to levels seen in  December 2023-January 2024 when a major  ground operation was conducted in Bureij and  Maghazi camps of Deir al-Balah Governorate.  This would include expanding and intensified  ground operations across all central camps  alongside neighbourhood-level clearing  operations throughout Khan Younis Governorate,  frequent armed actor clashes, and increased  bombardment (air, land, sea).. Expanded ground  operations within Deir al-Balah Governorate  would not necessarily be concurrent with a  major ground operation on Rafah. The wider  besiegement of the Gaza Strip would intensify.Conflict would rapidly escalate, including  the onset of a new, wide-ranging, and large- scale ground operation throughout Rafah  Governorate and concentrated on Rafah city,  intense and frequent armed actor clashes, and  a large increase in bombardment (air, land, sea).  The wider besiegement of the Gaza Strip would  intensify. Humanitarian  AccessHumanitarian access, including for the delivery  of life-saving multi-sector assistance to the most  vulnerable populations and data collection,  to Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah Governorate  would severely reduce, including due to the  onset of major ground operations in Rafah  Governorate, continued ground operations in  Khan Younis Governorate, the later resumption  of major ground operations in Deir al-Balah  Governorate, intensified bombardment (air, land,  sea), the closure of the Rafah border crossing  and reduction in crossings at Kerem Shalom, and  public order collapse.Humanitarian access to Rafah Governorate,  including for the delivery of life-saving multi- sector assistance to the most vulnerable  populations and data collection, would severely  reduce. Access to populations remaining within  Rafah city during the major ground operation  would be completely lost, while access to the  extreme concentration of displaced people  in the Rafah portion of the Al-Mawasi area  would be intermittent. This disruption would  result from the onset of major, rapid ground  operations in Rafah Governorate, continued  ground operations in Khan Younis Governorate,  intensified bombardment (air, land, sea), the  closure of the Rafah border crossing and  reduction in crossings at Kerem Shalom, and  public order collapse. <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF37 Factor/element Risk of Famine Scenario - Deir al-Balah and  Khan Younis GovernoratesRisk of Famine Scenario – Rafah Governorate Secondary Drivers Civil unrestAlready strained, public order would collapse,  involving widespread and intense civil unrest,  including looting, riots, vigilantism, escalating  violence among various social groups, and a  wider breakdown of social cohesion. This collapse  would heavily constrain humanitarian operations  through reducing access and inhibiting the ability  to conduct critical activities like distributions,  especially to the most vulnerable population  groups. The United Nations presence within the  Gaza Strip, including offices and storage facilities,  would be particularly impacted, including by  violence and looting. The loss of social cohesion  would involve the loss of most remaining socially- based coping, such as receiving food or cash  through social networks outside of immediate  family.Already strained, public order would collapse,  involving widespread and intense civil unrest,  including looting, riots, vigilantism, escalating  violence among various social groups, and  a wider breakdown of social cohesion.

Given the continued catastrophic food security situation across the entire Gaza Strip, a risk of Famine analysis was done for  Deir al Balah, Khan Younis, and Rafah Governorates. This analysis considered whether Famine will occur under a reasonable  worst-case scenario during the projection period through 15 July 2024. An analysis for the northern governorates was not  performed as the FRC is projecting Famine in those areas under the most likely scenario. The FRC considered the assumptions for the worst-case scenario made by the Analysis Team regarding the evolution of the  conflict and the expected impacts on food security and acute malnutrition to be plausible for all three governorates.  The intensity of the conflict and the extent of humanitarian space will determine the magnitude and directions of population  movement within the Gaza Strip. It is currently impossible to ascertain the destination(s) of these human-made displacements,  however any further concentration of population in any already highly populated area, for instance as a consequence of  an escalation in the Rafah Governorate driving hundreds of thousands towards Al-Mawasi and the surrounding areas, will  significantly increase the risk of Famine. The FRC considered the risk of Famine statement made by the Analysis Team about Deir al-Balah, Khan Younis and Rafah  Governorates to be plausible. Given the high degree of uncertainty and fluidity of the situation with displacements likely  forcing people to move to and from multiple localities, the FRC felt it was appropriate to group together all three of the  southern governates for a risk of Famine analysis rather than to separate the governates as different units of analysis.    Forced  displacement will increase the risk of Famine because of overcrowding, poor supply of food, water, and medicines, and limited  provision of health and wash services, which will expose the displaced population to epidemic outbreaks.  The FRC reached technical consensus that, under a reasonable worst-case scenario, there is a risk of Famine across the entire  middle and southern areas of the Gaza Strip during the projection period of mid-March to mid-July 2024. The cessation of  hostilities together with the restoration of humanitarian space to deliver multi-sectoral assistance and restore services are  essential steps in mitigating the risk of Famine.<br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF40 CONCLUSIONS OF THE FAMINE REVIEW COMMITTEE (FRC)  This report is the second time that the Famine Review Committee has reviewed analysis conducted by a multi-agency,  multi-sectoral Analysis Team to determine the current and projected food security situation in the Gaza Strip. The first  analysis, conducted in December 2023, determined that there was a risk of Famine within the projection period of  December 2023 to May 2024, and that the risk would increase for each day that the intense conflict and restricted  humanitarian access persisted or worsened.  The findings of the FRC’s latest review confirm that Famine is now projected and imminent in the North Gaza and Gaza  Governorates  and is expected to become manifest between mid-March 2024 and May 2024. The Famine threshold for  acute food insecurity has already been far exceeded and the steeply increasing trend in malnutrition data indicates that  it is highly likely that the Famine threshold for acute malnutrition has also been exceeded. The FRC expects the upward  trend in non-trauma mortality to accelerate and for all Famine thresholds to be passed imminently.  It is vital to note that the projected Famine can be prevented or alleviated. All evidence points towards a major  acceleration of deaths and malnutrition. Waiting for a retrospective Famine classification before acting is indefensible.  The FRC concludes that Famine is imminent unless there is an immediate cessation of hostilities and full access is granted  to provide food, water, medicines, and protection of civilians as well as to restore and provide health, water, and sanitation  services, and energy (electricity, diesel, and other fuel) to the population in the northern governorates.  In the current period  (leading up to mid-March), the FRC finds the conclusions of the IPC Analysis Team for the northern  governorates to be plausible (IPC Phase 4 Emergency). However, the FRC highlighted that: (i) Famine thresholds for acute  food insecurity have already been surpassed; (ii) Famine thresholds for acute malnutrition (Extremely Critical) have likely  already been surpassed; (iii) It is likely that these extreme levels of malnutrition have not yet translated into a Crude  Death Rate above 2/10,000/day. The likelihood of having surpassed Under-Five Death Rate thresholds (4/10,000/day for  children) is higher but impossible to ascertain.  For the Governorates of Deir al-Balah, Khan Younis, and Rafah , the FRC considers the findings of the Analysis Team  for the current period (IPC Phase 4 – Emergency) to be plausible. The projection period identified by the Analysis Team  is mid-March 2024 to mid-July 2024. The FRC considers the most likely scenarios and conclusions of the Analysis Team  for the projected period (IPC Phase 4 – Emergency) to be plausible. However, given the high uncertainty over how the  situation will evolve and a high degree of fluidity given the intensity of the conflict, forced displacements, and constricted  humanitarian access in the next 4 months, the FRC recommends grouping all southern governates together for a risk of  Famine analysis . Thus, for the combined southern and middle governates, the FRC concludes that there is a risk of  Famine during the projection period of mid-March to mid-July  in a worst-case scenario with a reasonable chance of  occurring.  The primary drivers of the food security, nutrition, and mortality situation in Gaza Strip are the conflict intensity and highly  constrained/restricted access, defined as the ability of humanitarian and private actors to deliver the necessary supplies  and services to the most vulnerable population. Only an immediate and sustainable cessation of hostility, accompanied  by a sustained supply of food, water, medicines, protection services, and provision of health and sanitation services  to the population can reduce acute malnutrition and excess mortality. Provision of electricity/fuel supplies for water  trucking, pumps, health services, restoration of agricultural production, and other essential needs are also critical, along  with support for unrestricted civilian communications within and outside of the Gaza Strip. The actions needed to prevent Famine require an immediate political decision for a ceasefire together with a significant  and immediate increase in humanitarian and commercial access to the entire population of Gaza. If this does not happen  fully and immediately, even if Famine is avoided in the near term, the impact on mortality and the lives of Palestinians  now, and in future generations, will increase markedly with every day.<br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF41 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ACTION Famine can be halted. The rapidly escalating hunger crisis in the Gaza Strip must immediately be curbed. This requires  putting an end to the hostilities, mobilizing necessary resources and ensuring the safe delivery of humanitarian assistance  to the people of Gaza.  Response Priorities  Overall recommendations • Restore humanitarian access to the entire Gaza Strip. • Stop the fast-paced deterioration of the food security, health and nutrition situation leading to excess mortality  through:  (i) the restoration of health, nutrition, and WASH services and the protection of civilians; and (ii) the provision of safe, nutritious, and sufficient food to all the population in need.  • The sustained supply of sufficient aid commodities, including but not limited to food, medicines, specialist nutrition  products, fuel, and other necessities should be allowed to enter and move throughout the entire Gaza Strip by road.  Traffic of commercial goods should also be fully resumed to meet the volume of commodities required.  Programmatic recommendations • Deliver acute malnutrition treatment services, specifically CMAM and IYCF-E services throughout the Gaza Strip, with  a particular emphasis on opening stabilization centres in the north. • Supply ready-to-use formula for non-breastfed infants and ensure sufficient access to safe drinking water if preparation  is required.  • Provide complimentary foods and micronutrient supplements for young children, as well as pregnant and lactating  women, the chronically ill, and the elderly. • Restore the functioning of market infrastructures and bakeries combined with cash-based interventions where  feasible. • Rehabilitate food production systems as soon as possible, including horticulture, livestock, and fishing. Situation Monitoring and Update  Considering the volatility of the context and the changing environment, the following risk factor elements should be  monitored continuously: • Intensity and extension of hostilities • Humanitarian access to supply food, water medicines, non-food items • Functionality and access to the health system and WASH supplies and services  • Entry of commodities though the Gaza Strip whether through commercial trucks or food assistance by truck or  airdrops • Population displacements and conditions in collective centres and scattered sites • Morbidity and disease outbreaks  • Acute malnutrition and mortality, with a distinction of the trauma and non-trauma causes <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF42 PROCESS AND METHODOLOGY Similar to the previous analysis conducted in December 2023, the IPC Global Partnership completed an IPC analysis for  the Gaza Strip to inform critical humanitarian information needs. Country led IPC analyses are the cornerstone of the  IPC process and will continue to be so. In the case of the Gaza Strip, with the onset of the conflict and the subsequent  humanitarian catastrophe, there was a critical need for an IPC analysis. Without an active country Technical Working  Group, the IPC Global Partnership made use of its non-TWG led analysis process to inform decision-making around the  crisis in the Gaza Strip.  The analysis was conducted remotely from 26 February to 1 March by over 40 experts from 18 agencies, applying standard  IPC protocols, and made use of publicly available data from a wide range of courses on the conditions in the Gaza Strip  (see below). Based on IPC protocols, the level of evidence of this analysis was assessed as “Medium” (level 2) for each of  the three units of analysis. At the analysis completion, the Famine Review Committee was activated to review the Analysis  Team’s findings. Their conclusions were adopted by the Analysis Team.

The IPC is a set of tools and procedures to  classify the severity and characteristics of  acute food and nutrition crises as well as  chronic food insecurity based on interna - tional standards. The IPC consists of four mu - tually reinforcing functions, each with a set  of specific protocols (tools and procedures).  The core IPC parameters include consen - sus building, convergence of evidence,  accountability, transparency and compa - rability. The IPC analysis aims at informing  emergency response as well as medium  and long-term food security policy and pro - gramming. For the IPC, acute food insecurity is defined  as any manifestation of food insecurity  found in a specified area at a specific point  in time of a severity that threatens lives or  livelihoods, or both, regardless of the causes,  context or duration. It is highly susceptible  to change and can occur and manifest in a  population within a short amount of time,  as a result of sudden changes or shocks that  negatively impact on the determinants of  food insecurity. Contact for further Information IPC Global Support Unit   www.ipcinfo.org IPC Special Briefs are produced by the IPC  global initiative and do not necessarily  reflect the views of stakeholders in the  Gaza Strip. Classification of food insecurity and  malnutrition was conducted using the  IPC protocols, which are developed and  implemented worldwide by the IPC Global  Partnership - Action Contre la Faim, CARE,  CILSS, EC-JRC, FAO, FEWS NET, Global Food  Security Cluster, Global Nutrition Cluster,  IFPRI, IGAD, Oxfam, SICA, SADC, Save the  Children, UNDP , UNICEF, WFP , WHO and the  World Bank. Phase 1 None/Minimal Households are able  to meet essential  food and non-food  needs without  engaging in atypical  and unsustainable  strategies to access  food and income.Phase 2 Stressed Households have  minimally adequate  food consumption  but are unable  to afford some  essential non-food  expenditures without  engaging in stress- coping strategies.Phase 3 Crisis Households either: • have food  consumption gaps  that are reflected by  high or above-usual  acute malnutrition; or • are marginally able  to meet minimum  food needs but  only by depleting  essential livelihood  assets or through  crisis-coping  strategies.Phase 4 Emergency Households either: • have large food  consumption gaps  that are reflected  in very high acute  malnutrition and  excess mortality; or • are able to  mitigate large  food consumption  gaps but only  by employing  emergency  livelihood strategies  and asset liquidationPhase 5 Catastrophe/  Famine Households  experience an  extreme lack of  food and/or cannot  meet other basic  needs even after  full employment of  coping strategies.  Starvation, death,  destitution and  extremely critical  acute malnutrition  levels are evident.  For Famine Classi  cation, area needs  to have extremely  critical levels of acute  malnutrition and  mortality.Acute Food Insecurity Phase name and descriptionLimitations of the Analysis  Given the major access constraints, data on food security outcomes  was collected using Computer Assisted Telephone Interviews (CATI).  Quality concerns regarding the use of this methodology including the  representativeness, and potential biases associated with mobile network  coverage and ownership were discussed at length during the previous round  of IPC analysis (for data collected in November 2023). The Analysis Team  concluded that the data meets the requirements set by the IPC and were  the same for this analysis, especially considering the number of observations.  Through the efforts of partners, gaps in nutrition information were filled  through screening information. The high degree of volatility around the  conflict limits the ability to consider longer analysis periods. Scenarios on the  evolution of the conflict were developed in conjunction with conflict experts  to the best of their knowledge and expertise. <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF44 ENDNOTES 1 PCBS Labour Force Survey, 2022 -

Only 63 completed questionnaires were recorded  in that survey round for Rafah governorate. Comparisons between the November-December 2023 survey round  and the December 2023-February 2024 survey round for Rafah governorate are only indicative given the non- representative sample from the first round. Additionally, the continued displacement recorded in the governorate of  Rafah after 5 December 2023 calls for additional caution when comparing Rafah governorate results across the two  survey rounds.</p></div>

<strong>
   March 18 - the day of solidarity with political prisoners - in honor of the communist and revolutionary prisoners
  </strong>
</h3>
<p>
  March 18 is the international day of solidarity with political prisoners. Red help was founded by the Comintern in 1920, and declared in 1923 on March 18, the date of the founding of the parish municipality, as "the international day of solidarity with political prisoners" and devoted it to the political prisoners. On March 18, solidarity is expressed with political prisoners around the world.

<p>
   "The philosophers have only
   <em>
    interpret
   </em>
   the world different; But what it depends on is to
   <em>
    change
   </em>
<p p="">
<p>
     Den reaksjonære indiske staten har sperret inne over ti tusen kommunistiske, revolusjonære og politiske aktivister, deriblant Varavara Rao, Sanjoy Deepak Rao, Ayinoor Vasu, Rona Wilson og Gautam Navlakha, for å forhindre folkekrigen.
    </p>
<p>
     Georges Ibrahim Abdallah har vært fengslet av fransk imperialisme i 40 år og har ennå ikke blitt løslatt, selv om han har sonet sin straff. Mumia Abu-Jamal, medlem av Black Panthers, har vært fengslet av amerikansk imperialisme i over 40 år. Tusenvis av kommunister, revolusjonære og fanger av undertrykte folk fra forskjellige deler av verden har tilbrakt tiår i fengsler.
    </p>
<p>
     The fears of the ruling classes of the communist and revolutionary prisoners and the class hatred they feel against them are so great that they ruthlessly prevent the communists and revolutionaries they hold trapped in open violations of their own laws from leaving the prisons. The murder of chairman Gonzalo in 2021, the head of PCP, who lost health after 29 years in isolation and whose death was caused because the necessary health measures were not implemented, is very important to understand the extent of the fear and class hatred as the imperialists and the servile owners of The ruling system feels. Those responsible for chairman Gonzalo's death burned and even destroyed his body.
    </p>
<p>
     The communist and revolutionary prisoners in the prisons strive to meet the requirements of the Class Fight, with the risk of their own lives by challenging the boundaries of the conditions in the prisons. They refuse to capitulate and hesitate to resist all kinds of pressure, torture and isolation. We must mobilize to support the legitimate struggle and resistance of the prisoners, to fight against any form of aggression against the prisoners, in order to be the prisoners' voice outside the walls, we must support their struggle during the detention conditions as part of the class struggle.

<strong>
   Last week, Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre and Defense Minister Bjørn Aril Gram met the lead in the state-owned arms group Kongsberg Gruppen and promised a billion contract for the delivery of NASAMs missiles.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  - Kongsberg can now obtain parts from hundreds of subcontractors so that they can produce quickly when the orders come, Støre told the bourgeois newspaper VG.
 </p>
<p>
  – Dette gjør vi for å styrke Ukrainas evne til å beskytte seg, men også fordi Norge vil trenge dette luftvernet, fortsetter han.
 </p>
<p>
  Støre recently stated that the government will spend two per cent of Norway's gross domestic product on the armed forces during the current year, and in this way fulfill NATO's upgrading goals.

   Workers of a yarn factory AA Yarn Limited

    clashed
   </a>
   with the police on the 9

   of March in Sreepur, Gazipur district of Bangladesh, demanding higher 
wages. The workers blocked the Dhaka-Mymensingh highway, denouncing that
 the factory bosses had ignored the demands of the workers for better 
pay despite multiple efforts from the workers to negotiate. The police 
repressed the workers with tear gas, rubber bullets and stun grenades, 
and the workers as a response defended the protest by throwing bricks at
 the police. It is reported that there was some injured among the 
workers as well as passers-by due to the police brutality.
  </p>
<p>
   The yarn workers of the factory earn around 6,000 Tk (around 55 US 
Dollars) a month, and the
   <span>

  protesters denounced that they are not able to
 live with this wage and that the wages had not been raised even to the 
new minimum set in November. In November, there were
  <a href="https://redherald.org/2023/11/14/bangladesh-thousands-of-workers-struggle-against-bureaucratic-capitalism/">
   large protests
  </a>
  of garment workers, who demanded that the minimum wage of the garment 
workers are raised from 8,000 Tk to 23,000 Tk. The government refused to
 raise the wage to the demanded level, and set 12,500 Tk (114 US 
Dollars) as the new monthly minimum wage. In November, these protests 
were also met with severe repression and police brutality, with hundreds
 arrested and at least two workers murdered by the police shooting at 
the protesters with live ammunition.

<p>
   On the 11
   <sup>

   of March workers of Sterling Styles Ltd
   <a href="https://www.tbsnews.net/economy/rmg/6-garment-workers-injured-during-protest-ashulias-sterling-styles-factory-807370">
    protested
   </a>
   in Jamgora, Ashulia, demanding overtime pay and paid holidays among 
other things. The factory boss said the factory operates according to 
the labor laws of Bangladesh and commented that “For the last three days
 our workers have been agitated with unreasonable demands, including 
payment of 11 days of annual leave as well as day-offs on every public 
holiday.” He said that they already give days off during Ramadan and 
that it is unreasonable to demand get paid also for these days. 
According to the boss, the workers had attacked six low level bosses and
 injured them. The workers had also thrown bricks at the police, who 
repressed the protest with tear gas. According to the media, a 
representative of the trade union Garments Sramik Oikya League said that
 the demands of the workers have “no legal justification” and that the 
union would not get involved.
  </p>
<p>
   These statements calling the demands unreasonable reflect on the 
conditions of the garment workers in Bangladesh, which is a 
semi-colonial and semi-feudal country with a large garments industry and
 where many clothes for imperialist monopolies, such as H&amp;M, Zara, 
Lidl and Primark are produced. We wrote in November: “This struggle of 
the Bangladeshi proletariat against garment monopolies of the 
bureaucratic capital is part of the struggle of the people against 
semi-feudality and semi-colonialism and the 
bureaucratic-big-landlord-dictatorship. Its not just a struggle for an 
increasing of the wage, but it is for national liberation, against the 
oppression and subjugation of the country to the imperialists…” These 
local clashes show that the situation continues as prone to explosion.

         The Paris commune proclaimed on March 18, 1871, represents a 
 Significant chapter in the history of the labor movement. Was the 
 First social essay of the revolutionary proletariat to take power 
  political, unleashing a civil war against the exploiters, 
 establishing an embryonic form of direct working democracy. Not only 
 It was a significant revolutionary action in itself, but 
 also provided a practical model for the future of the fight 
 proletarian.

         This government emerged spontaneously during the war 
 Franco-Prussian, as a response to general discontent against 
 bourgeoisie, who had triggered war and exercised a defense 
 mediocre of the homeland. The commune was elected on March 26 and proclaimed 
  two days later, implementing policies to meet the needs 
 immediate of the laborious masses and dissolving the old state of the 
 exploiters

         The measures taken by the commune included the abolition of the 
 Permanent Army and the Police, the democratic and revocable election of 
  officials with worker salaries, and the separation of the church and

 Practice the problem of the dictatorship of the proletariat, a dictatorship 
 For oppressive classes, with the democratic exercise of the masses

         The commune type is characterized by being a new type of state 
 that denies the bourgeois state. Its power comes from direct initiative 
 of the masses from below, replacing repressive institutions with 
 the general armament of the people and replacing the bureaucracy with 
 Eligible and removable officials. Serves the proletariat as a class 
 dominant to exercise their dictatorship over the ancient oppressors and 
 exploiters, but at the same time, it is the beginning of the denial of 
 All state.

         The women, since the beginning of the revolution on March 18, were 
 fundamental in the defense of the city, facing the troops of the 
 government and demonstrating its firmness not only in support work, but 
 with weapons in the barricades; especially during the last week. 
 The women of the commune were not limited to a "feminist movement" 
 traditional, but they were actively involved as workers and this 
  He could see in the organization of committees, clubs, cooperatives, such as 
 Union of women for the defense of Paris founded by Louise Michel.

         The military defeat of the commune occurred thanks to the alliance of 
 The Prussian forces that helped fence the city and the forces of 
 Thiers who were nourished by the release of prisoners in hands

 workers who did not take quick and urgent measures to 
 "Expropate the expropriators" as was the Bank of France, measures

   Western media whip up opinion in support of a new intervention in Haiti, but a professor of the United States states that Haiti has an "imperialism problem", not a "gang problem". Today's crisis in Haiti again emphasizes that the imperialists are unable to establish any order, and that the Haitian people will continue to fight against the imperialism and the insult to the country.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  Haiti's acting Prime Minister Ariel Henry announced on March 12, via Guyana's president, that he was leaving. This happened after the US Foreign Ministry has asked for a "transitional government" to deal with the political chaos of the country. Other countries in the region have held a crisis meeting to formulate a framework for this transition.
 </p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>
   Paramilitary groups and political crisis
  </strong>
</h3>
<p>
  The United States points to the "threads" of the Caribbean, saying that these armed groups create chaos. This is done at the same time as new choices are constantly being postponed in Haiti. Western media now says that the threads have taken over Haiti's capital Port-au-Prince. Henry's board will now be replaced by a "presidential council", which includes representatives from political coalitions, business, civil society and a religious leader. The authorities, which today do not even have a mandate under the old state's rotten laws, have declared a state of emergency and curfew at night.
 </p>
<p>
  Businessman Jovenel Moïse was elected president of Haiti in 2016, and he took over the office in February 2017. He was elected in a far -like election, where only 18.11% of voters participated. Since 2018, there has been no functioning parliament in the country, and Moïse ruled on decree until he was killed in an attack in July 2021. The leadership of the country was taken over by the "Interim Prime Minister" Claude Joseph, before Ariel Henry took over just days later. In short, Haiti has for several years been without chosen political leadership, and with Henry's departure - initiated by the United States - the regime becomes even more corporative, still without any legitimate mandate under the country's laws.
 </p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>
   Haiti's problem is imperialism
  </strong>
</h3>
<p>
  Dr. Jemima Pierre, professor at the University of Columbia in the United States, has stated to BreakThrough News at Haiti in reality does not have a "gang problem", but an "imperialism problem". She says that the threads of Haiti were originally structured and led by members of the ruler of Haiti, and also US-imperialism. She points out, among other things, that several gangs have their bases close to the US embassy, and that the violence and kidnappings the gangs are behind, have mainly hit the masses in Haiti. Neighborhoods in the capital have seen
 </p>
<p>
  Furthermore, the professor states that Haiti has been under occupation since 2004, where US imperialism initiated a bargain in the country where the elected president was deposed, and that this occupation is sanctioned by the UN-that the UN acts directly as a tool for the United States to Haiti. She also says that the US imperialism through various intrigues pushes Caribbean and African countries ahead. One of their plans has been for Kenya to send police officers to Haiti to establish "law and order", although this is contrary to Kenya's own laws. Henry was in Kenya to negotiate with Kenya and the UN when the new crisis arose, and did not return to the country.
 </p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>
   Reactionary violence, humanitarian crisis and popular resistance
  </strong>
</h3>
<p>
  Our Brazilian comrades in A Nova Democracia are asking in a case if the prime minister's departure will open up for paramilitary groups to take power directly. The comrades also write that the new crisis in Haiti, which increases the level of violence strongly, is a defeat for imperialism and the Brazilian generals. One of the most important actions of the armed groups was an attack on a prison, where they succeeded in freeing 4,000 prisoners. In another action, they almost succeeded in conquering the country's main airport.
 </p>
<p>
  The comrades write that the paramilitary groups have united on the basis of a call from leader Jimmy "Barbecue" Charzier, where he advocated to end the rivalry between the groups to throw the prime minister. There is now an expectation that the new "presidential council" will be defeated by the paramilitary groups, which are provided with weapons from the United States, especially from Florida - including heavy machine guns, rifles and drones.
 </p>
<p>
  At the same time, the people face the consequences of the reactionary violence, which now spreads even more after the centuries of imperialist interference in Haiti. The death rates of Haiti's largest slum are now on par with Syria, says Doctors Without Borders, and the UN says the country's health system is heading towards collapse.
 </p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>
   The background of the crisis
  </strong>
</h3>
<p>
  It is the US imperialism that is mainly responsible for the situation in Haiti, a country they have exercised dominance over two centuries, after the colonial power France was thrown out of the revolution in 1804. The Haitian revolution is a magnificent historical event. For the first time after the European powers colonized large parts of the world, and forced hundreds of millions of Africans into slavery, black folklasses in a revolution resulted in a revolution that led to the creation of a new state. This aroused fierce rage from the colonial powers, and to this day, Haiti is forced to pay "substitutes" to France for the "wallpaper" of the lucrative colony and slaves they held there. The economic exploitation and a large number of bargains and attacks organized by the imperialists have kept Haiti down in deep poverty.
 </p>
<p>
  The heroic masses still have their struggle and resistance without stopping for over 200 years. Riots and rebellions are developed again and again. The crowds do not find themselves in the dividend and oppression, and organize and fight under the hardest conditions - even when 200,000 people died in the earthquake affected Haiti in 2010. The enormous number of deaths are due to entirely poverty and imperialism. Earthquakes of the same size have far from the same fatal consequences in California or Japan. The masses have died as a result of miserable living conditions, lack of crisis preparedness, food shortages, medicine shortages and so on, not by the natural disaster itself.
 </p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>
   New intervention and the way to liberation
  </strong>
</h3>
<p>
  Now the Brazilian comrades write that Brazil's President Luiz Inázio states that it is "necessary to act quickly in Haiti", and that last September he wanted to send Brazilian rebel police to Haiti to operate under Kenyan leadership. The US Foreign Minister has also spoken to Kenya's president about the crisis in Haiti. Both the blink and Luiz inázio will "restore order", and this will be the third foreign intervention in Haiti - of which the previous one lasted 12 years (from 2005 to 2017). Brazilian forces participated in this, and used experiences from Haiti in their own armed suppression of the people in the favelas of São Paulo and the capital Rio de Janeiro.
 </p>
<p>
  The situation in Haiti also emphasizes what powdery Latin America is and what the storm center in the world revolution has moved to this continent. Land by country is shaken by constant crises, constantly immersion of the decay in the old states, and constant public rebellion. In February 2020, for example, there was a great popular rebellion in Haiti, and we have previously written up massive protests and general strikes, who have particularly targeted the US lackeys who have ruled the country. History shows that the masses in Haiti never give up, and that the people's struggle again and again will rise to release the country. There is a burning need to reconstitute Haiti's Communist Party as a Maoist party, to put the proletariat in the leadership of the people's struggle, for folk war and newly democratic revolution, which is the only thing that can secure the masses over imperialism and their lackeys.

     Dublin, 
  14/03/2024: a coalition of 206 groups of European civil society, 
 20 of which based in Ireland, he sent a letter to the 
 EU Commission, the EU Council and the European Parliament, asking for the 
 suspension of the association agreement with Israel in consideration 
 of the violation of human rights by that state.

     In the

 MSF emergency coordinator in Gaza.

<p align="justify">
  To reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality 
 Among the mothers and babies, we support the hospital with assistance 
 post-parto and we added 12 new beds to the department 
 reaching a total capacity of 20 beds, thus allowing more 
 patients receiving adequate monitoring after childbirth. 
 However, without the right supplies and with the health system below 
 Pressure many mothers are discharged only a few hours after childbirth. 
 In some cases due to the difficulty of accessing the services of 
 maternal health health, many pregnant women have not received 
 No type of assistance since the beginning of the war and have not 
 Made control visits.

   The critical issues of prenatal and post-parto care
  </b>

<p align="justify">
  When pregnant women do not have adequate access 
 medical care, enough food or appropriate refuge, 
 Both their children are more exposed to health problems, 
 including infections. The children of pregnant densetrite women or in 
 breastfeeding are at immediate risk of health problems and 
 potential deficiencies in long -term development. Over a third 
 of patients looking for prenatal care suffers from anemia, one 
 Critical condition for pregnant women. Also, almost half of 
 These women had gastro-urinary infections, such as 
 Urinary tract infections.

   Since we were displaced, it was 
 Difficult to find a way to go to the hospital and access 
 health services. It is difficult to find a place for care or

  In the first week of January, ours 
 gynecologists and midwives have provided prenatal care to over 200 
 patients in the Al Shaboura clinic. In the post-parto care department 
 of the Emiratine hospital, in the first week of expansion of the 
 department, we received 170 patients.
  <br/>
  What we try to 
 provide are: prenatal care, post-parto care, health support 
 mental, screening for malnutrition, therapeutic food 
 additional. However, without sufficient humanitarian aid in Gaza e 
 without the protection of the few health facilities still in 
 function, the supply of medical care will continue to be one 
 drop in the ocean.

 Using scissors generally used to cut paper, 
 Plastic clothespins for the role and dim light of mobile phones, Nour 
 Moeyn cut the umbilical cord of the nephew just

 Under an intense Israeli bombing, they were not there 
 neither equipment, nor electricity for the twenty -five nurse, 
 while he was born the girl of his sister in the middle of the roars 
 of air attacks and artillery. The nearest hospital 
 It was open. But the family could not risk leaving the house in the 
 heart of the night and go to the hospital, while the neighborhoods around 
 They were under attack. In addition, hospitals and ambulances in Gaza 
 they are crowded with Palestinians killed or injured in the attacks 
 Israelis. Moeyn's sister, Aya, had no choice that 
 gathering in the house of his family, where he had moved 
 at the beginning of the war.

   Around one in the morning, the pain of the

  ”, 
 Nada Nabeel, 31, says Aya's sister -in -law. "

   Not 
 We couldn't even think of going to the hospital, because it would be

 Nabeel said.
  <br/>
  One of the most basic problems, when yes 
 performs this procedure at home at night is the lack of 
 electricity.
  <br/>
  Immediately after the Hamas attack of 7 October, 
 Israel has cut all electricity and fuel supplies 
 to the coastal enclave. Since then, the Palestinians have done 
 custody on the light of candles, on battery -powered LEDs and 
 on solar panels.

   During the war we got used to 
 Sit in the dark, sometimes with a small candle or a led light. But 
 This time we could not rely on the light of the candles

 We all turned on the torches on our cell phones to help 
 Nour to see well

 Allarrata was welcome.
  <br/>
  During the times of 
 war, the families of Gaza tend to meet in a single place, in 
 Try for protection and comfort. There is a common desire to live 
 or die together.

 family member as something left from the screen of a film e

 vast civilian majority. Aya's family did not expect

   Nour had to perform care

  The difficult situation of future mothers is a heartbreaking subtitle of the largest tragedy that is being consumed in the Gaza strip. Inside the besieged enclave, the sanctuary of the womb became a battlefield where life in the flower waver on the brink of the abyss, threatened by the stress of the conflict, by the spectrum of hunger and by the potential murder of the child's mother.

  <br>
  But almost 40% of hospitals are destroyed or only partially and almost two thirds of the basic health care clinics are closed. While hospitals are under pressure under the weight of the overwhelming demand and decrease resources, future mothers are faced with a terrible dilemma: to give birth in the middle of the chaos at home or risk the dangerous journey in search of medical assistance. The corridors of the medical structures, once crowded, overflowing with waiting, now testify to the silent agony of the mothers who give birth among the rubble, their shouts mitigated by the deafening roar of the conflict. The tribute of the war extends beyond the physical kingdom, infiltrating the tissue of maternal health itself: the emotional well -being of women.

Yet, the presence of a new life evokes a hope that trembles like a candle in the wind, a lighthouse of light in the midst of the darkness that envelops Gaza. Faced with unimaginable adversities, the indomitable spirit of the mothers of Gaza survives, testifying to the lasting power of the human spirit to persevere in the most difficult circumstances. In the streets of Gaza sprinkled with rubble, future mothers cling to the weakest glimmer of hope, their resilience is a testimony of the lasting power of the human spirit in the face of impersonable adversities. In the darkest moments, their stories act as lighthouse of light, a reminder of the fact that even in the middle of the chaos of the conflict, the human spirit remains intact.

  In 30 minutes, in Gaza, a woman who has given birth naturally must leave her hospital bed to make room for new parturies. When the waiting list is not long, the resignation takes place after 2 hours. For cesarean, women must leave the hospital after only 2 hours on the most chaotic days, but still never beyond 6. And this is because in Gaza only 13 of the 36 hospitals are still partially functioning. Every day, when I walk to go to the office, I do nothing but think about how much they can be worth 30 minutes ...

  February 1, 2014. In Gaza for women's birth women and their children it is increasingly difficult to access pre and post-natal medical care. In the Rafah area, the maternity hospital is the only structure left to assist pregnant women. To date, due to the continuous growth of the needs of the population and a lack of resources, the Rafah hospital is able to respond only to the most at risk and urgent parts. We are deeply worried about the growing lack of obstetric assistance for women in Gaza.
 </p>
<p align="justify">
<strong>
   The number of parts at the Rafah hospital is tripled
  </strong>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  According to the World Health Organization, there are about 50,000 women pregnant in Gaza, and about 20,000 children were born since the beginning of the war, according to UNICEF.
 </p>
<p align="justify">
  Due to the ongoing humanitarian crisis - with i

   Inaccessible primary health services
  </a>
  And the impossibility of reaching hospitals due to lack of fuel as well as the scarce capacity of the health facilities still functioning - pregnant women in Gaza have not had access to medical checks for months. Many are forced to give birth in plastic curtains or in public buildings. Those who manage to give birth in a hospital often returns to their fortune refuge a few hours after making a cesarean birth.
 </p>
<p align="justify">
  “
  <em>
   With so many displaced people, the situation in Rafah is frightening. All spaces are overcrowded, with people living in curtains, schools and hospitals. The Emiratine hospital is currently facing the number of parts that managed before the war three times
  </em>
  "Says Pascale Coissard, coordinator of the MSF emergency in Gaza.
 </p>
<p align="justify">
  To reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality between mothers and babies, we support the hospital with post-parto assistance and we have added 12 new beds to the department reaching a total capacity of 20 beds, thus allowing more patients to receive monitoring adequate after childbirth. However, without the right supplies and with the health system under pressure many mothers are discharged only after a few hours after childbirth. In some cases due to the difficulty of accessing maternal health services, many pregnant women have not received any type of assistance since the beginning of the war and have not made control visits.

  <br/>
  What we try to provide are: prenatal care, post-parto care, mental health support, malnutrition screening, additional therapeutic food food. However, without sufficient humanitarian aid in Gaza and without the protection of the few health facilities still in operation, the supply of medical care will continue to be a drop in the ocean.

 Using scissors generally used to cut the paper, plastic clothespins for the role and dim light of cell phones, Nour Moeyn cut the umbilical cord of the newborn grandson.
 <br/>
 Under an intense Israeli bombing, there were neither equipment nor electricity for the twenty -five year old nurse, while she was born the girl of her sister in the middle of the roars of air attacks and artillery. The nearest hospital was open. But the family could not risk leaving the house in the middle of the night and going to the hospital, while the neighborhoods around them were under attack. In addition, hospitals and ambulances in Gaza are crowded with Palestinians killed or injured in Israeli attacks. Moeyn's sister, Aya, had no choice but to give birth to her family's house, where she moved to the beginning of the war.

  One of the most basic problems, when performing this procedure at home, at night, is the lack of electricity.

   During the war we got used to sitting in the dark, sometimes with a small candle or a led light. But this time we could not rely on the light of the candles and, even if the batteries of our phone were about to discharge, we all turned on the torches on our cell phones to help Nour to see well

   The women directed their torches to Aya and the men out prayed for his salvation. All in the building, all the displaced people in all apartments, were awake and repeated 'Ya Rab, Ya Rab
  </em>
  ’[In Arabic means oh, God],". "
  <em>
   The sounds of the bombings were very strong, mixed with the cries of Aya while fighting to give birth and the voices of her relatives and other displaced people who prayed and told her that they were strong and to resist. Everything was surreal. As much as the details can describe, nobody can imagine the scene
  </em>
  ”.

<strong>
   No medical equipment
  </strong>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, the Israeli army destroyed 52 medical structures and 56 ambulances in the Gaza Strip, and killed at least 283 health workers. So far about 18,000 Palestinians have been killed, the vast civilian majority. Aya's family did not expect it to give birth so soon, so no emergency plan had been agreed. Without medical equipment, they had to use domestic objects they had at home. "
  <em>
   The weather was about to expire and we feared for the life of the girl while Nour and Aya were struggling to pull her out. The voices of the prayers were heard and I kept the cell phone with the torch, I read the Koran and cried
  </em>
  ", Nabeel continued.
 </p>
<p align="justify">
  “
  <em>
   A few minutes later, the girl finally was born and once out, Aya and everyone broke out in tears. It was a moment of relief for all of us. Nour embraced Aya strong and kissed her on the forehead, and the displaced people applauded and thanked God
  </em>
  "." Nabeel said they managed to get away with disinfected scissors and laundry springs, but when it was a placenta, there was nothing appropriate at hand to extract it. "
  <em>
   Nour had to perform the postpartum treatments with bare hands, cleaning Aya's uterus and manually extracting the placenta. And fortunately, he didn't have to cut part of the vagina during childbirth, so he didn't need to suture it
  </em>
  ", he added. "
  <em>
   The next morning, they went to the complex
  </em>
  [medico]
  <em>
   of Al-Sahaba to control Aya and the girl's health, and thank God they were in perfect condition
  </em>
  .”
  <br/>
  According to Dr. Adan Radi, obstetric and gynecologist of the Al-Awda hospital in the north of the Gaza Strip, there are about 55,000 pregnant women in Gaza who need regular health care.
  <br/>
  “
  <em>
   We called the small mass
  </em>
  [diamond, in Arabic]
  <em>
   because the conditions in which it was born were unusual, but also because it is precious and stubborn
  </em>
  ", Nabeel said. "
  <em>
   He insisted on being born, in the middle of all adverse circumstances
  </em>
  .”

   Student associations and colleges demonstrated on Tuesday (19/3) on the streets of Thessaloniki, expressing their solidarity with the 49 arrests of the MAT invasion of the AUTH on Saturday 16/3. The rally started at 8pm from Kamara, shortly after the end of the general meetings of the students.

   The presence of the police was suffocating, with MAT squads constantly moving alongside the march and back. Similar police rule prevailed in the lunch of Student on Thursday 14/3. In the wake of government fake news for the alleged nuclear rifle in the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki and the persecutions prepared by Mitsotakis' statements for disciplinary disciplines, it is clear that the system will employ the hardening of repression to burn the students.

      The thing had actually gone differently. Starting from the second 
 week of October I provided my classes some ideas of 
 reflection on the Israeli-Palestinian question, with reference to

      Leave us free to teach that we repudiate the war and the

      In 
  schools is increasingly difficult to carry out the professor's profession, because 
 Our function is increasingly aligned with the will of the managers 
 school and governments. The space of critical reflection is always 
 more small. In the colleges of teachers there is no discussion freely, we are 
 become an organ that ratifies not ours.

  principals take on the physiognomy of company managers, are not 
 formats to promote education for critical thinking. The teachers

      Per
 Teachers' College of my school I felt the need to 
communicate my discomfort in continuing to work in the din of the 
bombs, as if nothing had happened. I tried to convey my discomfort 
reading among the "miscellaneous and eventual" a document in which I questioned myself 
on the meaning of the function of the teacher in the current conditions, but 
I felt that it was in itself offensive to our dignity as a 
teachers deal with this crucial issue in the residual phase 
of the agenda, the only one in which it is possible to deviate for some reason 
protocol, when you're ready to run away for the 
fatigue.

</p>
<p align="justify" class="western" lang="en-US">

<span>
      But 
  The most important sign of the teacher's difficulty in reflection 
 collective criticism is the progressive failure to the mother of all 
 intimidation, the one that transformed the word "political" into a 
 Taboo term. Thus, in the school minister who sterilizes everything, 
 While we bring Pericles to pupils and pupils, they reproach us 
 when we apply it by venturing into the mined field of the debate 
 politic.

  Culture of equidistance cannot belong to critical people. Self 
  There is an oppressed, it must be said that there is. If there is an oppressor, not 
 We must be afraid to consider it such. These cannot be put 
 different realities on the same level. We have to report the roots 
 of war and explain to the boys and girls what the 
 colonialism and imperialism.

 We must absolutely talk about politics at school by rejecting each 
 intimidation. This need for thought reproach us to

    The president of the Generalitat Pere Aragonès announced last Wednesday, March 13 that the regional elections were ahead of May 12. What should be the opinion of the revolutionaries about it? With this opinion article we intend to clarify some fundamental issues.

    The Torrent of Mobilization and Fury of the Catalan National Liberation Movement, whose qualitative leap we saw on October 1, 2017 with the realization of the referendum declared illegal by the Spanish State -and its subsequent repression -has not led to anything. We must get lesson from what happened.

    "Luckily ours govern and not the PP and Vox," they say in the TV3 gatherings. The reality is that ERC, Junts and PSC govern exactly the same as PSOE, PP and VOX. Catalan bourgeois politicians are class enemies of the proletariat and enemies of the people. They seek independence only for their economic interests, do not hesitate to crush the proletariat and give them absolutely the same the Catalan language and culture.

    The bourgeois path keeps the proletariat and the people in poverty, as they have done for centuries. Price rise and IPC increase, labor exploitation, rise in rentals, evictions and police violence, etc. Catalan bourgeois politicians in Barcelona have ruled in the same way as Spanish bourgeois politicians in Madrid. The bourgeois road urges the masses to participate in the electoral farce, seek to turn off the desire of the people of democratic rights and freedoms and spread racism and chauvinism against peoples (both the Spanish people and the oppressed nations of Latin America, Africa and Asia ).

    In recent years, revisionists and opportunists of all kinds have called for the masses to participate in the electoral farce, to turn their political claims in Parliament and continue along the bourgeois path. The bourgeois road only serves the bourgeoisie. You cannot change the bourgeois state from the inside, you cannot change a machine of oppression from within. Much less, independence can be achieved by participating within the institutions of the Spanish State (Generalitat, Diputations, Town Halls ...) and being part of it.

    - Because the growing fascistization of the State (greater presence in the streets and in the media of fascist parties and/or organizations, increasing influence of reactionary ideas, etc ...) is the logical consequence of the militarization of the Spanish State. Since 1980, as an approximate date, states begin to militarize. Within the militarization plan of the Spanish State, fascistization is a consequence of this. Therefore, a greater presence of fascism is not caused by electoral success. It is conversely: the electoral success of reactionary and fascist forces is caused because fascism and reaction is more present in society, a consequence of this militarization and fascistization of states (and in this case, of the Spanish State)

    There will be no more or less repression of the workers' movement depending on the government of the day, or at least, by express decision of the party that governs. That is to say, the greater or lesser repression responds to the plans of the financial oligarchy, and not to the plans of the bourgeois leader of the day. During the last years of the progressive government of PSOE and Unidas Podemos we have suffered repression in the metal strike of Cadiz and Vigo; the imprisonment of political prisoner Pablo Hasel; they have not repealed the Gag Law; they have committed genocide against the African masses in Melilla; they have committed thousands and thousands of evictions; They have infiltrated national police into social and political movements, etc.

    The Catalan proletariat will be completely free not only when their national rights are respected, but when it is released as a social class. And that goes through the destruction of the Spanish imperialist state, the old bourgeois state, and for generating a new power, the new proletarian state.

    Forty years have passed since the proclamation of the commune of Paris. According to the established custom, the French proletariat honored with rallies and demonstrations the memory of the men of the revolution of March 18, 1871. At the end of May it will return to flow crowns of flowers to the tombs of the combined communards, victims of the terrible "May week", and before them he will swear again that he will fight tirelessly until the total triumph of his ideas, until he fulfilled the work they read.

    Why the proletariat, not only French, but that of the whole world, honors the men of the commune of Paris as their predecessors? What is the inheritance of the commune?
    <o:p>
</o:p>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span>
<span>
    The commune arose spontaneously, no one prepared it consciously and systemically. The unfortunate war with Germany, deprivations during the site, the unemployment between the proletariat and the ruin of the little bourgeoisie, the outrage of the masses against the upper classes and the authorities, which had demonstrated an absolute inability, the deaf effervescence in the working class, unhappy of his situation and anxious to a new social regime; The reactionary composition of the National Assembly, which made fear for the fate of the Republic, all and many other causes were combined to boost the population of Paris to the March 18 revolution, which unexpectedly put power in the hands of the National Guard, in the hands of the working class and the little bourgeoisie, who had joined her.
    <o:p>
</o:p>
</span>

</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span>
<span>
    It was an unprecedented historical event. Until then, the power had been, as a rule, in the hands of the landowners and the capitalists, that is, of their proxies, which constituted the so -called government. After the revolution of March 18, when the government of Mr. Thiers fled from Paris with his troops, his police and his officials, the people owned the situation and the power passed to the proletariat. But in Modern Society, the proletariat, economicly overwhelmed by capital, cannot dominate politically if it does not break the chains that tied it to capital. Hence, the movement of the commune should inevitably acquire a socialist dye, that is, it should tend to overthrow the domain of the bourgeoisie, the domination of capital, to the destruction of the very basis of the contemporary social regime.
    <o:p>
</o:p>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span>
<span>
    At first it was a very heterogeneous and confusing movement. The patriots adhered to him, hoping that the commune would resume the war against the Germans, leading it to a venturous outcome. They were also supported by the little tenders, in danger of ruin if the payment of the defeated debts of the rentals (postponement that the government denied them, but that the commune granted them) was not postponed). Finally, in the beginning they also sympathized with him with him the bourgeois Republicans, fearful that the National Assembly reactionary (the "rural", the wild landwives) restored the monarchy. But the fundamental role in this movement was naturally performed by the workers (especially the artisans of Paris), among which in the last years of the second empire an intense socialist propaganda, and that even many of them were International affiliates.
    <o:p>
</o:p>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span>
<span>
    Only the workers remained faithful to the commune until the end. The Republican bourgeois and the little bourgeoisie soon departed from her very: some scared the revolutionary socialist character of the movement, because of their proletarian character; Others departed from her to see that she was condemned to an inevitable defeat. Only the French proletarians supported their government, without fear or fainting, only they fought and died for it, that is, for the emancipation of the working class, for a better future for the workers.

    In order for a social revolution to succeed, it needs at least two conditions: a high development of the productive forces and a proletariat prepared for it. But in 1871 it was lacked both conditions. French capitalism was still poorly developed, and France was then, fundamentally, a country of little bourgeoisie (artisans, peasants, shopkeepers, etc.). On the other hand, there was no labor party, and the working class was not prepared or had a long training, and mostly even clearly understood what their ends were or how it could reach them. There was no serious political organization of the proletariat, nor strong unions, nor cooperative societies ...
    <o:p>
</o:p>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span>
<span>
    But what lacked the commune was, mainly time, the possibility of realizing the situation and undertaking the realization of its program. He had not had time to start the task when the government, entrenched in Versailles and supported throughout the bourgeoisie, began military operations against Paris. The commune had to think first of all about its own defense. And until the end, which came in the week of May 21 to 28, he could not think seriously in anything else.
    <o:p>

<span>
<span>
    All these measures eloquently showed that the commune was a deadly threat to the old world, based on oppression and exploitation. That was the reason that the bourgeois society could not sleep peacefully while in the Paris City Council the Red Flag of the proletariat waved. And when the organized government force could finally dominate the poorly organized force of the revolution, the Bonapartist Generals, those generals beaten by the Germans and brave before their defeated compatriots, those Rénnenkampf and Meller-Zakomielski French, made a massacre As Paris had never seen. About 30,000 Parisians were killed by unbridled soldiers; Some 45,000 were arrested and many of them subsequently executed; Thousands were the banished or convicted to work forced. In total, Paris lost about 100,000 of their children, including the best workers of all trades.

    The bourgeoisie was happy. "Now the socialism has ended for a long time!", Said his boss, the bloodthirsty Dwarf Thiers, when he and his generals drowned in blood the uprising of the proletariat of Paris. But those bourgeois crows grazed in vain. After six years of having crushed the commune, when many of their fighters were still in prison or in exile, a new labor movement began in France. The new socialist generation, enriched with the experience of its predecessors, whose defeat had not discouraged it at all, picked up the flag that had fallen from the hands of the fighters of the commune and carried it forward with firmness and boldness, to the cry of “ Long live the social revolution, live the commune! ” And three or four years later, a new labor party and the agitation raised by it in the country forced the ruling classes to release the communards that the Government still kept imprisoned.

    The cause of the commune is the cause of the social revolution, it is the cause of the complete political and economic emancipation of the workers, it is the cause of the world proletariat. And in this sense it is immortal.

<strong>
    Definitely scary!
   </strong>
   It does not spend a year without the figures of femicides for various reasons and everything under the real inoperance of the state that hypocritically serves as a women's defender, but in reality it is its main oppressor.
  </p>
<p>
   Femicides at the hands of their partners or uncomfortable partners, even for the most futile causes, such as small domestic affairs, when they supposedly love them or loved them, although it is also known, that many women feel forced to live with colleagues who do not want.
  </p>
<p>
   And it is that this State, precisely because of its character, bourgeois, landowner and pro-imperialist, that is, for being at the service of the ruling classes and imperialism, it hardly fulfills its role as guarantor of the safety and integrity of women and not It goes from speaking of protocols and offering some lines to prevent such facts, but that never work and finally the woman is in a state of helplessness with respect to her perpetrators.
  </p>
<p>
   To this is added the infamous war against the people freed by the army, the guerrillas and the paramilitaries, who, in blood and fire, do not cease to snatch the lands to the peasantry to rise with the production of psychotropics and by the runners to get them to the Market, as well as mining and other agroindustrial crops, along with the juicy weapons business. War in the midst of whose massacres and torture, women, in addition, are subjected by mass, violations and all kinds of vexars, and where the State is nothing more than complicit of land expropriators, as happened during the government of the government of the government Mafia, where the Attorney General's Office, which should prosecute both the massacres, and femicides and violations, was openly at the service of the mafia regime.
  </p>
<p>
   Nor can we ignore the lack of a serious study of this phenomenon, because to the innumerable investigators, the abysmal differences in the figures of victims that each report is added; Not only should there be a single victim, but neither confusion about those figures, because this prevents becoming an objective idea of the situation.
  </p>
<p>
   Finally, in the face of consummated facts, justice is not only extremely slow to resolve, but around it, extreme cases such as feminicide receive the house by jail, thus revictimizing women.
  </p>
<p>
   With this panorama as violent as terrifying, the only beneficiaries are feminicides and the capitalist system because the situation of women, not only remains the same, but also worsens, given the increase in violence in public spaces, because of the women are intimidated and submitted with terror.
  </p>
<p>
   In conclusion, the situation of women in the midst of this capitalist society, unable to guarantee not only their rights, but their physical and moral integrity, is shouting for revolution!, Which, as the teachers of the proletariat and how it is ratified in each fight of the struggle of our class for our liberation, it is your definitive response.
  </p>
<p>
   For this reason, to pave the way to this objective, from the ranks of the Communist Obrera Union (MLM), we call all the women of Colombia to participate in the revolutionary female movement that we are promoting, which begins by deciding to fight shoulder To shoulder with the men of our class, today for our economic, political and social claims for tomorrow to move forward in the total and deep transformation of this society, because contrary to bourgeois feminism, only then will we reach our own liberation.

  On March 18, about 100 squatters from Barro Branco, Furnas, Cabii, Monteiro, Caiana, Morcego, Caixa d'Agua, Tenório and Sítio Grande, located in the rural area of Jaqueira, Pernambuco (PE), Morcego, Tenório and Sítio Grande, Organized by the League of Poor Peasants (LCP), they joined to resume their sources of water that were surrounded by the Mata Sul Agricultural Latiface, belonging to the Guilherme Maranhão landowner.

  Since 2015, when theft of lands and water sources began, peasants live and produce in the lands of the former Frei Caneca plant. Latifundry Guilherme Maranhão supported by former governor Paulo Camara, installed pistolage groups that threaten the entire population to expand cutting cattle for international export through the Masterboi refrigerator.
 </p>
<p>
  Despite the extensive evidence of water poisoning with pesticides launched by landlords (in addition to contamination of sources with feces and cattle urine), the Pernambuco Public Prosecutor's Office (MPPE) and the Pernambuco State Secretariat of Environment (CPR) never opened any Criminal inquiry against the agricultural Latifundia Mata Sul S/A.
 </p>
<p>
  Therefore, the peasants decided in a popular assembly to perform a great act to resume the water sources of the landlord. The call reached the entire population of the municipality with leafleting at the fairs and in all peasant communities affected by this environmental crime and against the health of the people. The peasants also organized joint efforts for cleaning and demarcating the water sources, 50 meters away from cattle breeds and landlipping plantations.

  To do all this work, the squatters had the support of the peasants of the revolutionary area José Ricardo and the young students of the Mangue Vermelho Movement. They helped clean the bush and mark the fences to protect the water sources under the scorching sun. In addition, they faced the landlords of the landowners with all people with all people.

  As soon as the peasants ended the effort of the first source of the day, with a lot of struggle, singing popular songs and shouting slogans, half a dozen landowner gunmen appeared with tractor, pickups, motorcycles and quadricycles. The gunmen arrived with piles, wires and eucalyptus seedlings to install in the same area as the peasants just cleaned. When the peasant march crossed with the bad guys, the latifundal envoys threatened the peasants with firearms. The tension resulted in confrontation, and three gunmen were injured and a estate drone was shattered by the popular fury masses against the gun
 </p>
<p>
  On the same March 18, the agrarian prosecutor of the MPPE, the CPRH agents, representatives of the State Committee on the Monitoring of Agricultural Conflicts (CEACA), representatives of the Pastoral Land Commission (CPT) and the Federation of Workers and Farmers of Pernambuco ( Fetape), Mayor Ridete Pellegrino and Jaqueira councilors, as well as lawyers of the Mata Sul Agricultural Latiface, made visits to investigate complaints from the landowner against the peasants. According to information, this commission did not visit the water sources of the peasants, only the places indicated by the landowners.
 </p>
<p>
  However, the peasant action of the peasants forced the whole commission to present itself at the scene of the act and accept two lawyers of the Brazilian Association of Lawyers (Abrapo) and the president of the Barro Branco Picners Association in the Commission and still had to accept the terms of the people at the audience that needed to mobilize the hurry.
 </p>
<p>
  In the end, the MPPE accepted a proposal of the peasants represented by Abrapo for the creation of “waters”, to demarcate all sources of water to the people. The landowner was summoned to pay for the stakes and wires, the city will send employees to perform the work and the State Secretariat of Environment was to examine the waters of the people to determine the contamination and open criminal inquiry against landlord.
 </p>
<p>
  After the hearing, Guilherme Maranhão gunmen asked the Pernambuco Military Police (PM-PE) to be reinforced to plant eucalyptus in one of the water sources that the peasants had cleaned in task force and the lawyer of the landlord Eduardo Figueredo announced that they will perform military action to expel peasant families from areas near the woods.
 </p>
<p>
  Two vehicles were sent to make the safety of the gunmen to continue acting against the people. This is not an act of courage, but of cowardice in the face of the small demonstration of strength of the united peasants and organized by the agrarian revolution. It also demonstrates how the military forces of this old state are committed to protecting the interests of landowners and promoting misfortunes for the poor population of the countryside and the city.
 </p>
<p>
  The squatters of the lands of the former Frei Caneca plant are determined to resume all their sources of water and their lands back from the land of the landlord. Thus, they call all peasants in the South Mata Zone of Pernambuco to rise against the pistolage groups of the landlords and the military forces of this old state. Without destroying the landlord there will never be justice to the poor people of the countryside.

<p>
  A new genius/Quaest research, conducted from March 14 to 18, revealed that the assessment of the “market” about how the economy in Luiz Inácio went up, and is above the popular evaluation of the same sector. Of the 101 shareholders, “
  <em>
   traders
  </em>
  ”, Bourgeois economists and investors consulted, 50% consider the role of Finance Minister Fernando Haddad as positive. The data draw attention when compared to other recent research, such as Atlas Intel, which revealed that 53% of the population negatively evaluates the economy.
 </p>
<p>
  Luiz Inácio, by itself, was evaluated as positive by only 6%, a drop of 3% compared to the latest survey. Another 64% considered the agent's performance as negative (a 12% increase) and 39% as regular (9% fall). Haddad's work was judged as positive for 50% (an increase of 7%), regular by 38% (5% increase) and negative by 12% (falling 12%).
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Luiz Inácio and Haddad: What's the difference?
 </h4>
<p>
  They are somewhat contrasting, but reflecting an artificial division of the government, as if there was an abyss between Luiz Inacio and Fernando Haddad.
 </p>
<p>
  Of course there are differences in government, even within the petista summit. Figures like Haddad, for example, have opted from the beginning by prioritizing sectors of the great bourgeoisie more directly aligned and fostered by imperialism and financial capital. Others, such as the president of BNDES, Aloizio Mercadante, and Luiz Inacio himself, tend to prioritize other sectors of the great bourgeoisie, also subjected to imperialism, but also different from the bonds and promotion extracted from state incentives, and use from the state to leverage bureaucratic capitalism.
 </p>
<p>
  Nevertheless, the agent did not oppose projects that directly benefited, or at least sought to affect, the shareholders of imperialism, such as the taxation of the taxation of
  <em>
   offshores
  </em>
  assembled by Haddad (approved with a
  <a href="https://anovademocracia.com.br/projeto-de-taxacao-das-offshores-aprovado-por-governo-e-congresso-e-para-ingles-ver/">
   Discount Absurd to Shareholders
  </a>
  , a true privilege to the sector denounced by several economists), the tax reform and the tax framework itself, a pleasing to all sectors of the great bourgeoisie. In January 2024, Luiz Inácio even stated that Haddad could be "the best Finance Minister in the country."
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Financial leeches
 </h4>
<p>
  What the shareholders interviewed reveal, thus, in the research, is greed itself: even with the government support for the approval of the vast majority of projects they have taken as centrals in 2023, the "market" vultures follow more benefits search for more benefits. and new ways for the sagging of public coffers. Therefore, they badly assess Luiz Inacio, despite the agent commitment of the agent with the plans of the Minister of Finance, and support Haddad effusively, in an attempt to make clear the
  <a href="https://anovademocracia.com.br/editorial-semanal-dois-programas-reacionarios-em-contenda/">
   reactionary program that prefer
  </a>
  .
 </p>
<p>
  The same is true of other rates, such as the disapproval of 97% of interviewees from Petrobras's decision not to pay extraordinary dividends (payment that would impair several basic operations of the company, which already pays the highest dividends when compared to several oil companies multinationals) and the accusation that the greatest risk of the current government is "interventionism." They are true leeches, patrons of large companies and “independent” institutions (such as the Central Bank) so that they can submit them to the maximum of the wishes of financial capital.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Market evaluates government better than the people
 </h4>
<p>
  In this picture, such a negative assessment of the “market” could even be regarded as a compliment to Luiz Inacio, if it were not for other variables: these positive points that could be extracted from the recent research are lost when considered that the people evaluate the economic situation of the country Worse than the market, a clear sign of whom the economic policy of the current government serves. According to the Atlas Intel survey released in recent weeks, 53% of respondents consider it to be bad. The new data was a 5% increase in the previous survey of January, and it was the first time in the current government that the negative assessment of the economy exceeded 50%. Another data, this one from Quaest survey, conducted on February 27, showed that 73% of respondents realized a rise in prices, compared to 48% of the previous survey.
 </p>
<p>
  In other words, while market assessment of the economy in the current government has advanced, the people's perception of the same area has been growing disapproval. The explanation can be given by simple ways: at the time the shareholders see their projects served, the people are still waiting for the so far and expected campaign promises, even those of the most basic improvements in living conditions. Last month, prices rose again, with high sectors such as education at all levels, from day care to postgraduate, food, such as the costs of basic food baskets and items such as rice, fruits, potatoes, milk and Onion and also in the transport area, with discharge in gasoline and public transport.

   Comrades of the International Communist Movement, we put to its consideration the thesis of Comrade Aureliano S., co -founder of the journal contradiction and of the Communist Workers Union (MLM). These thesis correspond to the comrade's vision on the world situation, the world proletarian revolution and the way that the new international must now acquire to respond to the demands of these times.
  </p>
<p>
   The comrade's position does not compromise the organization of the Union; However, at its maximum democratic event in the XV Assembly "Comrade Jaime Rangel", he decided to undertake his study to promote the discussion and take a position in this regard; That is why we advertise them so that the comrades of the different countries also pronounce.
  </p>
<p>
   As in advance it is known that the thesis will cause a stir, the comrade is willing to support them from the questions and questions that inevitably arise. Therefore we encourage organizations, parties and comrades, cadres and militants of the different countries, to participate in this debate that will surely contribute to raise the level of understanding of the current situation, the perspective of the world proletarian revolution and the tasks that it to it correspond to the revolutionary proletariat of all countries.
  </p>
<p>
   Our Blog International Debate will publish your questions, concerns, questions and positions.

   Thesis on the World Association of the Proletariat
  </h4>
<ol>
<li li="">
<li>
     This requires an international revolution of the proletariat, which understands the totality or the majority, at least, of land countries. The triumph of the socialist revolution in a single country is no longer possible. In other words, the current situation of humanity tends to a world revolution against capitalism and only socialism can save humanity. Since capitalism in its agony is the reaction throughout the line and has shown that it is willing to the wildest repression and to commit the greatest crimes in order to maintain the privileges of the bourgeoisie and its profits, at the expense of plundering the working class And nature, now, more than ever, rebellion is justified. Revolutionary violence is justified.
    </li>
<li li="">
<li>
      Such a situation requires rethinking the construction tactics of the international organization of the proletariat. An international type of new type is necessary: a world association of proletarians, based on the fraternal solidarity of all land workers. Its joint struggle is the only guarantee to raise consciousness and prepare the conditions for the final assault on the imperialist strength and fulfill its historical mission to end all forms of oppression and exploitation and bring humanity to a production of its material goods without plundering nature. And the main condition of such assault is the constitution of the Revolutionary Party of the proletariat.
     </li>
<li>
      The association must admit in its bosom all organizations and individuals, of all the trends of the labor movement, in the manner of a melting that through the fire of the fight acrisole the true proletarian movement. Only in this way can the alliances of the labor movement with other movements be established and with all those who are willing to fight against capitalism and prevent the destruction of civilization and life on earth.
     </li>
<li>
      The association must be governed by democratic centralism and have a single world management center and sectional organizations in each country or nation.
     </li>
<li>
      The communists, as part of the labor movement, must contribute with all energy to the construction of such association, without pretending to be the owners of it. Of course, Marxist communists Leninists Maoist must continue to strive to build MLM communist parties as part of the association and to achieve their unity worldwide and thus be able to contribute more force to the formation of the World Workers Association.
     </li>
<li>
      Proletarians of the world units.
     </li>

   Forty years have passed since the proclamation of the commune of Paris. According to the established custom, the French proletariat honored with rallies and demonstrations the memory of the men of the revolution of March 18, 1871. At the end of May it will return to flow crowns of flowers to the tombs of the combined communards, victims of the terrible "May week", and before them he will swear again that he will fight tirelessly until the total triumph of his ideas, until he fulfilled the work they read.
  </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-c20091c369163f5e9835ac37af237d2e">
   Why the proletariat, not only French, but that of the whole world, honors the men of the commune of Paris as their predecessors? What is the inheritance of the commune?
  </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-6cc6253556607add06128b374872bf03">
   The commune arose spontaneously, no one prepared it consciously and systemically. The unfortunate war with Germany, deprivations during the site, the unemployment between the proletariat and the ruin of the little bourgeoisie, the outrage of the masses against the upper classes and the authorities, which had demonstrated an absolute inability, the deaf effervescence in the working class, unhappy of his situation and anxious to a new social regime; The reactionary composition of the National Assembly, which made fear for the fate of the Republic, all and many other causes were combined to boost the population of Paris to the March 18 revolution, which unexpectedly put power in the hands of the National Guard, in the hands of the working class and the little bourgeoisie, who had joined her.
  </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-bdf50a030e7bb36d2d04e2d45cc7ec20">
   It was an unprecedented historical event. Until then, the power had been, as a rule, in the hands of the landowners and the capitalists, that is, of their proxies, which constituted the so -called government. After the revolution of March 18, when the government of Mr. Thiers fled from Paris with his troops, his police and his officials, the people owned the situation and the power passed to the proletariat. But in Modern Society, the proletariat, economicly overwhelmed by capital, cannot dominate politically if it does not break the chains that tied it to capital. Hence, the movement of the commune should inevitably acquire a socialist dye, that is, it should tend to overthrow the domain of the bourgeoisie, the domination of capital, to the destruction of the very basis of the contemporary social regime.
  </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-5d2459ca34ff880724b7864671bcea13">
   At first it was a very heterogeneous and confusing movement. The patriots adhered to him, hoping that the commune would resume the war against the Germans, leading it to a venturous outcome. They were also supported by the little tenders, in danger of ruin if the payment of the defeated debts of the rentals (postponement that the government denied them, but that the commune granted them) was not postponed). Finally, in the beginning they also sympathized with him with him the bourgeois Republicans, fearful that the National Assembly reactionary (the "rural", the wild landwives) restored the monarchy. But the fundamental role in this movement was naturally performed by the workers (especially the artisans of Paris), among which in the last years of the second empire an intense socialist propaganda, and that even many of them were International affiliates.
  </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-c8b54aa1281b65b134b34cbe64fc99cb">
   Only the workers remained faithful to the commune until the end. The Republican bourgeois and the little bourgeoisie soon departed from her very: some scared the revolutionary socialist character of the movement, because of their proletarian character; Others departed from her to see that she was condemned to an inevitable defeat. Only the French proletarians supported their government, without fear or fainting, only they fought and died for it, that is, for the emancipation of the working class, for a better future for the workers.
  </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-e4ef250573290337b081b1d621cc1a2c" p="">
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-6dd6b387c016138d57dfa6fd0c4a71bc">
    In order for a social revolution to succeed, it needs at least two conditions: a high development of the productive forces and a proletariat prepared for it. But in 1871 it was lacked both conditions. French capitalism was still poorly developed, and France was then, fundamentally, a country of little bourgeoisie (artisans, peasants, shopkeepers, etc.). On the other hand, there was no labor party, and the working class was not prepared or had a long training, and mostly even clearly understood what their ends were or how it could reach them. There was no serious political organization of the proletariat, or strong unions, or cooperative societies ...
   </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-addc628c107269766012a5364200f719">
    But what lacked the commune was, mainly time, the possibility of realizing the situation and undertaking the realization of its program. He had not had time to start the task when the government, entrenched in Versailles and supported throughout the bourgeoisie, began military operations against Paris. The commune had to think first of all about its own defense. And until the end, which came in the week of May 21 to 28, he could not think seriously in anything else.
   </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-0b3765c1878027c34142ed0df22e8c70" p="">
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-02c387bb93920ecec71f7f7b26ccdcc3">
     All these measures eloquently showed that the commune was a deadly threat to the old world, based on oppression and exploitation. That was the reason that the bourgeois society could not sleep peacefully while in the Paris City Council the Red Flag of the proletariat waved. And when the organized government force could finally dominate the poorly organized force of the revolution, the Bonapartist Generals, those generals beaten by the Germans and brave before their defeated compatriots, those Rénnenkampf and Meller-Zakomielski French, made a massacre As Paris had never seen. About 30,000 Parisians were killed by unbridled soldiers; Some 45,000 were arrested and many of them subsequently executed; Thousands were the banished or convicted to work forced. In total, Paris lost about 100,000 of their children, including the best workers of all trades.
    </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-0cec93498970dd9b9df57eb33fe065e9">
     The bourgeoisie was happy. "Now the socialism has ended for a long time!", Said his boss, the bloodthirsty Dwarf Thiers, when he and his generals drowned in blood the uprising of the proletariat of Paris. But those bourgeois crows grazed in vain. After six years of having crushed the commune, when many of their fighters were still in prison or in exile, a new labor movement began in France. The new socialist generation, enriched with the experience of its predecessors, whose defeat had not discouraged it at all, picked up the flag that had fallen from the hands of the fighters of the commune and carried it forward with firmness and boldness, to the cry of “ Long live the social revolution, live the commune! ” And three or four years later, a new labor party and the agitation raised by it in the country forced the ruling classes to release the communards that the Government still kept imprisoned.
    </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-325063f4d7ec6ba25c039a8ea1af1cbb" p="">
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-d38cf81f2778524488005cf07ae28a01">
      The cause of the commune is the cause of the social revolution, it is the cause of the complete political and economic emancipation of the workers, it is the cause of the world proletariat. And in this sense it is immortal.

<p>
  Different ministerial actions and a campaign entitled “60 years of the 1964-2024 coup-without memory there is no future” were the activities planned by the Ministry of Human Rights for April 1 that were canceled by the Order of Luiz Inacio to perform critical acts to the military coup at the mark of six decades of the episode. The information was revealed by Folha de São Paulo.
 </p>
<p>
  The documents accessed by the monopolistic newspaper indicate that one of the actions was entitled “Called for an interministerial and intersectoral campaign”, and sought to articulate different sectors in an act of condemnation of the coup. Another act was looking for a series of “formal reparations”, as a public apology from the different ministries to those who suffered for the military regime.
 </p>
<p>
  They are unquestionably shy initiatives, but what stands out most in the picture is not the lack of voluptuousness of actions planned by the human rights portfolio, but as Luiz Inacio ordered the end of these purely institutional initiatives, which would directly affect the barracks. No reactionary military man would be forced to take part in the “public apology”, for example.
 </p>
<p>
  And if the government capitulates even in movements like these, what else can be expected? If the presidency does not want to gather ministers for a retraction on behalf of the Brazilian State, who can expect bodies such as the Special Commission on Political Dead and Missing (extinct in Bolsonaro's government), which investigates the crimes of the military regime and cast more light in Will torturers and murderers of the military regime be reopened by the current government?
 </p>
<p>
  Moreover, another central question is raised again: if the government feels so shy to formally condemn the coup 60 years ago, as it will fight
  <em>
   in fact
  </em>
  The coup today? According to some in the government, Luiz Inacio "discouraged" the military to celebrate the military coup, but the kind request did not work. In Rio, the Military Club has already marked an event to celebrate the date, which will have as a speaker a general known for the pro-64 positions and pro-intervention of the barracks in national political life.
 </p>
<p>
  Bring to the Bank of the Defendants some generals and other senior mandates burned by the proximity to the Bolsonarist Center, which is a cause for the government in recent weeks, it is not the highest fight against coup, no matter how necessary. The fight against coup necessarily permeates the conception present in the reactionary armed forces since the founding of the Republic that they are the true moderating power
  <strong>
</strong>
  of the nation.
 </p>
<p>
  This conception is not exclusive to those who drive institutional rupture in 2022, precisely because it is a nuclear part of the Brazilian reactionary forces and being passed on generation after generation in training courses. Freire Gomes, for example, former army commander who allegedly opposed the break in 2022, signed the note that, besides showing support for camps in front of the barracks, argued that the Armed Forces were
  <a href="https://www.cms.eb.mil.br/index.php/noticias/as-instituicoes-e-ao-povo-brasileiro#:~:text=sempre%20presentes%20e%20moderadoras%20nos%20mais%20importantes%20momentos%20de%20nossa%20hist%C3%B3ria" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   “Always present and moderators in the most important moments of our history”
  </a>
  . Throughout the last year, and particularly at a January 2023 meeting with his subordinates, the current commander Tomás Paiva and then (in January) commander of the Southeast Military Command, also
  <a href="https://anovademocracia.com.br/luiz-inacio-deveria-se-preocupar-com-os-generais-legalistas/">
   It has already made it clear that it is not against the politicization of the Armed Forces reactionary and its intervention in national political life
  </a>
  .
 </p>
<p>
  This podium has already stated and will continue to say: forgetting the coup of 64 only matters to today's scammers.
 </p>
<p>
  Progressive and democratic activists across the country, among which are family members of the regime's victim, similarly state that it is impossible to deal with recent episodes of coup in the country without taking into account the 1964 coup and, besides it, “amystist ”To the generals of the period in the departure of the regime.

<div class="article-content">
<p>
  Within Brazilian reactionary institutions, the struggle between the Armed Forces and the Federal Supreme Court has been fought since the past decade, particularly after the 2013-2014 popular surveys and Operation Lava-Jato. In the following years, in the face of the political crisis and institutional shaking, contradictions became more and more acute in the dispute for defining which form should assume the old Brazilian state to conduct the people's exploitation system.
 </p>
<p>
  Take as an example the former Army Commander Freire Gomes. Today called a "traitor" by pockets and treated as "saints" by reactionary analysts and by the federal government, some unsuspecting could think that his contribution to the country is appeasing the political shakes caused by the far right. Well, until recently this gentleman was discussing a scheme to arrest Alexandre de Moraes. The information is from Vera Rosa, from the state of São Paulo.
 </p>
<p>
  In August 2022, while still commander of the Army, Freire Gomes met with the other commanders and other generals at the closed doors to discuss the call by the newly sworn in president of the Superior Electoral Court (TSE) - Alexandre de Moraes - of an extraordinary meeting with the commanders of the military police to discuss the security of the elections. Complaining that, by the Constitution, who commands the PMs and the auxiliary forces is the army and that it was not even consulted by Moraes, Freire Gomes, enraged, even discussed a proposal to request the Attorney General's Office the arrest of the Minister of STF. A close look concludes that the Constitution, after all, can serve the interventionist purposes of the Armed Forces and that, most likely, such a request would be fulfilled by the then Attorney General, Augusto Aras.
 </p>
<p>
  There are STF ministers, among them Gilmar Mendes, who advocate investigations over the next three months of officers who, knowing Bolsonaro's coup plan, did nothing. Others, such as André Mendonça, continue to defend the thesis of the military, according to which the officers should not be moved, only in Jair Bolsonaro. Although the nation deserves to be aware of everything that the military commanders have set up in the goal of punishing them for their crimes against the people, one can have no illusion with the
  <a href="https://anovademocracia.com.br/sobram-provas-para-prender-bolsonaro-faltam-meios-para-o-stf-acabar-com-chaga-do-golpismo/">
   Liberal right that heads the STF
  </a>
  .
 </p>
<p>
  This is also why the justice of the warning raised by this podium that one should not trust everything is confirmed in the monopolies of communication should not be confirmed. Especially when it comes to the Armed Forces that, after the end of the military regime, they led a broad amnesty process, a constituent assembly in which they imposed articles that give the intervention of the military (Article 142) and whose name of greatest prestige of the Last 30 years (General Eduardo Villas-Bôas) has admitted that the reactionary armed forces must be “silent protagonists for society to know that the crisis will not exceed certain limits”, launching the settings of “legitimacy, stability, legality”.

   March 18 - Day of Solidarity to Political Prisoners - Tribute to Communist and Revolutionary Prisoners
  </strong>
</h2>
<p>
  March 18 is the International Day of Solidarity to political prisoners. Founded by Comintern in 1920, Red Socorro in 1923 declared March 18, given the founding of the Paris Commune, such as the “International Day of Solidarity to Political Prisoners” and dedicated him to political prisoners. On March 18, solidarity with political prisoners is expressed around the world.

    As the contradictions of the dominant system deepen and their stagnations multiply as their fear of the "burials" grows, the ruling classes do not hesitate to increasingly reveal their true character. At the same time, the increasingly profound and insoluble system crisis is leading the bourgeoisie and the ruling classes exploiting all kinds to centralize the sovereign state mechanism more strongly, both with their laws and their organizations

     The Indian reactionary state arrested more than ten thousand communists, revolutionaries and political activists, including Varavara Rao, Sanjoy Deepak Rao, Ayinoor Vasu, Rona Wilson and Gautam Navlakha, to burg the popular war.
    </p>
<p>
     Georges Ibrahim Abdallah has been imprisoned by French imperialism for 40 years and has not yet been released, although he has already fulfilled his sentence. Mumia Abu-Jamal, a member of the Black Panthers, has been trapped by Yankee imperialism for over 40 years. Thousands of communists, revolutionaries and prisoners of oppressed peoples from different parts of the world spent decades in jail.
    </p>
<p>
     The fear of the ruling classes of communist and revolutionary prisoners and the class enmity they feel to them is so great that they pretense that the communists and revolutionaries who keep enclosed, in the open violation of their own laws, come out of prisons. The murder of President Gonzalo in 2021, head of the PCP, who lost his health after 29 years in solitary confinement and whose death was caused because the necessary measures were not taken, it is very important to understand the extension of fear and hate that They feel the imperialists and the servants of the dominant system. Those responsible for the death of President Gonzalo, who even burned and destroyed his body.
    </p>
<p>
     Communist and revolutionary prisoners in prisons are trying to comply with the requirements of class struggle to the risk of their lives, to the limits of prison conditions. They refuse to capitulate and do not hesitate to resist all types of pressure, torture and lone confinement. We must mobilize to support the legitimate struggle and resistance of prisoners, to fight all kinds of aggression against prisoners, to be the voice of prisoners outside the jail, we must support their struggle under the conditions of imprisonment as part of the class struggle outside.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      Communist and revolutionary prisoners are our honor!
     </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
      Supporting communist and revolutionary prisoners means supporting the revolutionary struggle!
     </strong>
</p>

<strong>
      Let us make our resistance and struggle of communist and revolutionary prisoners. Let us be the voice of the prisoners!

<p>
  While investigations show that a considerable part of the Armed Forces and high official, albeit minority, mobilized to consummate the military coup, agent Luiz Inacio reiterated his orientation: not promoting acts or condemnatory events at the 60th anniversary of the coup 64.
 </p>
<p>
  To prove the error of this policy of the shift government, it would be enough to quote how the reactionary sectors of the ruling classes received. Representing the military right, ultra-reactionary Hamilton Mourão had no doubt: "He is right, this is passed," he said, referring to the military coup and the fascist military regime.
 </p>
<p>
  Estadão, accustomed to criticizing Luiz Inácio, rushed to leave in his defense: “Lula acts correctly” when she refuses to talk about the 1964 coup in the passage of her 60 years, in line with “an imperative of governability in a context of Wounds waiting for healing ”and“ is also a way to honor the current military command, also artificial of pacification ”, said in the editorial“ The accommodation of Lula with the military ”(March 17). Speaking of wounds, it is simply pathetic that Estadão who has already argued that the government reopens the Special Commission on Political Dead and Missing (CEMDP), what Luiz Inacio refuses to do, capitule choir with the cowardly complicity of this government.
 </p>
<p>
  Only reactionary ideologues - committed first and foremost to the continuity of the exploitation of the people and the nation - and the opportunists, whose castrated mentality by decades of subservience and conciliation with the enemies of popular masses believe that appeasement will lead to the country's stabilization.
 </p>
<p p="">
<p>
   Even before Bolsonaro, the High Command changed the result of the elections (2018), when removing Luiz Inacio from the match, through blackmail during a habeas corpus vote of that candidate in the Supreme Court.
  </p>
<p>
   As we see: Long before Bolsonaro assumed - and independent of him - the latent wound of coup again manifested acutely, even because it was not properly treated since 1988, when the previous appeasement with gorillas and transition with the amnesty military regime General and unrestricted, he led that there was no punishment, nor change in high military official, nor in the curricula of formation, nor in the doctrine of the Armed Forces, which followed, all these years, glorifying the 1964 coup as a legitimate movement and even as “Democratic Revolution,” and when they remove from the forefront of managing the old state, resuming the belief of being the armed forces as a moderating power and spitting of the “democratic rule of law” - and therefore also spun from their restriction or Even suspension, as he blatantly tried to make Bolsonaro.
  </p>
<p p="">
<p>
    When Luiz Inácio elects the policy of appeasement to deal with the military crisis, he is allowing all the favorable conditions to be restored for the Military High Command to return to the offensive later. When the masses rise in defense of their rights, which is inevitable, gorillas, as a moderating power to believe, will again rise threatening the country with military intervention to save the nation from "disintegration." Because they were not seriously confronted when they were demoralized and fragile, the gorillas will find favorable ground for a new coup climb.
   </p>
<p>
    The appeasement with the military summit only breastfeed the coup!
   </p>
<p>
    To genuine, progressive and revolutionary democrats, in addition to the popular masses in struggle, there is no other way other than with the 60th anniversary of the 60th anniversary of the ignominious 1964 coup and coup, either in the form of institutional rupture, or in the form of “moderating power”. Commitments to fascists and scammers - who would only lead us to coup and fascism are not acceptable.

  The fact that the Left Party is a social democratic force that shakes with various left -wing phrases, but is ultimately completely connected to this system, should actually be clear to everyone. However, there are always moments when this is particularly obvious. The Left Party Saxony-Anhalt recently with a reactionary CDU politician. One reason to take a closer look at the situation of the Left Party.
 </p>
<p>
  The CDU politician that deals with is Götz Ulrich. He is a district administrator in the Burgenland district. The corresponding situation was that the AfD wanted to make a demonstration that was originally supposed to pass his house. Even if the AfD ultimately agreed to lay the demonstration route, Ulrich sensed an attempted intimidation against it and pulled parallels during the Nazi era. Numerous other parties jumped up on this train and seemed to once again seemed to call the defense of bourgeois democracy in front of their AfD campaign in the AfD campaign.

<p>
  The Left Party also jumped on this train and fully solidarized with Ulrich Götz. Paradox, because in her apparent fight against racism, this party was solidarity with a politician who represents racist rights. Responsible demands such as the faster deportations and the introduction of payment cards for refugees are by no means AfD claims, but things that are challenged by politicians like Götz Ulrich equally

   The party congress ultimately ended with a compromise. While there was a decided application in the decisions, which explits only solidarity with all violent anti-fascists, there was also an evaluation of the Antifa-Ost procedure at the urging of the party youth, which is not a whole and not half solidarity. Instead of actually clearly demanding freedom for the Antifa-Ost prisoners, this evaluation says: "We recognize the risk of generalization and delegitimation of anti-fascist resistance fights and solidarity with left-wing political prisoners." But if you mean “left -wing political prisoners”, there are apparently different views in that party.

    In the meantime, the Left Party is increasingly on the way to political insignificance. In addition to the factor of their internal contradictions, more and more people have become and realize how little one can believe this party and their fetching. Not at all, as is the case with all bourgeois parties.
