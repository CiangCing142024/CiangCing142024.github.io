      Per
 Teachers' College of my school I felt the need to 
communicate my discomfort in continuing to work in the din of the 
bombs, as if nothing had happened. I tried to convey my discomfort 
reading among the "miscellaneous and eventual" a document in which I questioned myself 
on the meaning of the function of the teacher in the current conditions, but 
I felt that it was in itself offensive to our dignity as a 
teachers deal with this crucial issue in the residual phase 
of the agenda, the only one in which it is possible to deviate for some reason 
protocol, when you're ready to run away for the 
fatigue.

      But 
  The most important sign of the teacher's difficulty in reflection 
 collective criticism is the progressive failure to the mother of all 
 intimidation, the one that transformed the word "political" into a 
 Taboo term. Thus, in the school minister who sterilizes everything, 
 While we bring Pericles to pupils and pupils, they reproach us 
 when we apply it by venturing into the mined field of the debate 
 politic.

  Culture of equidistance cannot belong to critical people. Self 
  There is an oppressed, it must be said that there is. If there is an oppressor, not 
 We must be afraid to consider it such. These cannot be put 
 different realities on the same level. We have to report the roots 
 of war and explain to the boys and girls what the 
 colonialism and imperialism.

      The education 
  It is intimately linked to this task, it is a political function in 
 higher sense of the term. Only the ignorant denies it. In this sense 
 We must absolutely talk about politics at school by rejecting each 
 intimidation. This need for thought reproach us to 
 claim.
