 <p class="MsoNormal">
  The government's persecution industry is expanding against teachers and workers with dozens of lawsuits and civilizations throughout Greece and with a special way against Piraeus teachers, upgrading the settled indictment.
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">
  The dismissal of the EKPA employee, the prosecutions of the president of the Piraeus Labor Center, to the president of PENEN, and even Mitsotakis' recent statements about the deletions of the students who occupy a continuation of the political and trade union industry and is an integral part of the industry. Public and political life. It is clear that the system has one goal alone. To put the resistance, the claim, the struggle to illegally. To put in illegality the class union and political action, to crush democratic rights and political freedoms, but also any collective racing expression against the anti -populist anti -labor policy of the system.
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">
  They want a school adapted to the labor and social medieval times that attempt to impose. They want to prepare the youth for modern slaves of capitalism. They want teachers to work without rights, with their head bent, aligned and obedient performers of their class reactive policy.
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">
  The government is stepping up persecution at a time when it is escalating the attack on training with a host of bills and cutting off private universities, facing the fair struggle of students and students with the intensity of state terrorism and repression. With prosecutors, with arrests of students, with the state mechanism of directors and rectors in the campaign of threats, strokeing demonstrations, with military -type repressive interventions at universities to evacuate the democratic determinations. Asylum.
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">
  The government and the system are sending a message to the "enemy" people that anti -populist politics will pass with "fire and iron". How the only "regularity" is the profitability of local and foreign capital. In this regularity they want to subdue the people by unlawful student and student occupations, farmers 'blocks, workers' strikes, defense of popular housing, gatherings, demonstrations, trade unions and political action. For this reason, the system intensifies the policy of fascism, equipped the repressive mechanisms, is fortified by a number of laws that abolish democratic rights.
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">
  In this context, teachers are persecuted by a system that is scared and runs to prevent the accumulated rage and indignation of the people, workers and youth not turning into a struggle, a popular uprising for the right to study, at work, in Freedoms, in life. They are afraid of the power of popular, workers and youth struggles. They know that the right of the struggle is more powerful than state violence, that the popular struggle can fear their real nightmare. They don't scare us, they don't terrorize us. We continue on the road to the relentless and incompatible fight with high fists.
