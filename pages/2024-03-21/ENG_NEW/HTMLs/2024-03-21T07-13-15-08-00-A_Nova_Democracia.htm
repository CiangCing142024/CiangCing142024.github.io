  While investigations show that a considerable part of the Armed Forces and high official, albeit minority, mobilized to consummate the military coup, agent Luiz Inacio reiterated his orientation: not promoting acts or condemnatory events at the 60th anniversary of the coup 64.
 </p>
 <p>
  To prove the error of this policy of the shift government, it would be enough to quote how the reactionary sectors of the ruling classes received. Representing the military right, ultra-reactionary Hamilton Mourão had no doubt: "He is right, this is passed," he said, referring to the military coup and the fascist military regime.
 </p>
 <p>
  Estadão, accustomed to criticizing Luiz Inácio, rushed to leave in his defense: “Lula acts correctly” when she refuses to talk about the 1964 coup in the passage of her 60 years, in line with “an imperative of governability in a context of Wounds waiting for healing ”and“ is also a way to honor the current military command, also artificial of pacification ”, said in the editorial“ The accommodation of Lula with the military ”(March 17). Speaking of wounds, it is simply pathetic that Estadão who has already argued that the government reopens the Special Commission on Political Dead and Missing (CEMDP), what Luiz Inacio refuses to do, capitule choir with the cowardly complicity of this government.
 </p>
 <p>
  Only reactionary ideologues - committed first and foremost to the continuity of the exploitation of the people and the nation - and the opportunists, whose castrated mentality by decades of subservience and conciliation with the enemies of popular masses believe that appeasement will lead to the country's stabilization.
 </p>
 <p p="">
  <p>
   Even before Bolsonaro, the High Command changed the result of the elections (2018), when removing Luiz Inacio from the match, through blackmail during a habeas corpus vote of that candidate in the Supreme Court.
  </p>
  <p>
   As we see: Long before Bolsonaro assumed - and independent of him - the latent wound of coup again manifested acutely, even because it was not properly treated since 1988, when the previous appeasement with gorillas and transition with the amnesty military regime General and unrestricted, he led that there was no punishment, nor change in high military official, nor in the curricula of formation, nor in the doctrine of the Armed Forces, which followed, all these years, glorifying the 1964 coup as a legitimate movement and even as “Democratic Revolution,” and when they remove from the forefront of managing the old state, resuming the belief of being the armed forces as a moderating power and spitting of the “democratic rule of law” - and therefore also spun from their restriction or Even suspension, as he blatantly tried to make Bolsonaro.
  </p>
  <p p="">
   <p>
    When Luiz Inácio elects the policy of appeasement to deal with the military crisis, he is allowing all the favorable conditions to be restored for the Military High Command to return to the offensive later. When the masses rise in defense of their rights, which is inevitable, gorillas, as a moderating power to believe, will again rise threatening the country with military intervention to save the nation from "disintegration." Because they were not seriously confronted when they were demoralized and fragile, the gorillas will find favorable ground for a new coup climb.
   </p>
   <p>
    The appeasement with the military summit only breastfeed the coup!
   </p>
   <p>
    To genuine, progressive and revolutionary democrats, in addition to the popular masses in struggle, there is no other way other than with the 60th anniversary of the 60th anniversary of the ignominious 1964 coup and coup, either in the form of institutional rupture, or in the form of “moderating power”. Commitments to fascists and scammers - who would only lead us to coup and fascism are not acceptable.
