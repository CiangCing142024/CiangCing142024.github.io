  February 1, 2014. In Gaza for partorient women

 The only structure left to assist pregnant women. To date to

 poor ability of the health facilities still functioning - the 
 pregnant women in Gaza did not have access to controls

 MSF emergency coordinator in Gaza.

  To reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality 
 Among the mothers and babies, we support the hospital with assistance 
 post-parto and we added 12 new beds to the department 
 reaching a total capacity of 20 beds, thus allowing more 
 patients receiving adequate monitoring after childbirth. 
 However, without the right supplies and with the health system below 
 Pressure many mothers are discharged only a few hours after childbirth. 
 In some cases due to the difficulty of accessing the services of 
 maternal health health, many pregnant women have not received 
 No type of assistance since the beginning of the war and have not 
 Made control visits.

   The critical issues of prenatal and post-parto care

 <p align="justify">
  When pregnant women do not have adequate access 
 medical care, enough food or appropriate refuge, 
 Both their children are more exposed to health problems, 
 including infections. The children of pregnant densetrite women or in 
 breastfeeding are at immediate risk of health problems and 
 potential deficiencies in long -term development. Over a third 
 of patients looking for prenatal care suffers from anemia, one 
 Critical condition for pregnant women. Also, almost half of 
 These women had gastro-urinary infections, such as 
 Urinary tract infections.

 Under an intense Israeli bombing, they were not there 
 neither equipment, nor electricity for the twenty -five nurse, 
 while he was born the girl of his sister in the middle of the roars 
 of air attacks and artillery. The nearest hospital 
 It was open. But the family could not risk leaving the house in the 
 heart of the night and go to the hospital, while the neighborhoods around 
 They were under attack. In addition, hospitals and ambulances in Gaza 
 they are crowded with Palestinians killed or injured in the attacks 
 Israelis. Moeyn's sister, Aya, had no choice that 
 gathering in the house of his family, where he had moved 
 at the beginning of the war.

 Nada Nabeel, 31, says Aya's sister -in -law. "

  One of the most basic problems, when yes 
 performs this procedure at home at night is the lack of 
 electricity.

 custody on the light of candles, on battery -powered LEDs and 
 on solar panels.

   During the war we got used to 
 Sit in the dark, sometimes with a small candle or a led light. But 
 This time we could not rely on the light of the candles 
 and, even if the batteries of our phone were about to discharge, 
 We all turned on the torches on our cell phones to help 
 Nour to see well
