 <p>
  <strong>
   Our people,
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  As a result of our general policy regarding the electoral process, our evaluations of the developments and the negotiations, we have concluded: we declare to our people that we will protest the election on the grounds that sufficient conditions are not met in Dersim, where we have the condition to participate in the election in favor of the DEM Party [The Peoples’ Equality and Democracy Party], and that approaches that are incompatible with the interests and expectations of the people are dominant here. We do not support any candidate. We see that the reaction that our people have been showing openly for a while, sometimes expressed through action, is appropriate, and that an organization based on this reaction is a basic necessity. We consider it our duty to do justice to this reaction in our work.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   THERE IS NO GROUND FOR COMMON AGREEMENT!
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Communists try to use all means and opportunities to develop the revolutionary struggle. Our principles and perspective require this. Serving the revolution is possible by determining policies in line with the interests and objective tendencies of the masses. Everything that is not evaluated “for the revolution” and that does not comply with the expectations and objective interests of the people deals blows to the indispensable relationship of trust. This is much more important, especially since elections involve competing by the rules set by the bourgeois-feudal state. As a matter of fact, the latest attack on the trustees is a definitive proof of this reality. The unsuccessful policy followed against the trustees as a blow to the will of the people has created a serious trust issue. While patriotic Kurdish politics continues to be destroyed by all kinds of attacks and the rules of the State, it is a necessity to think in line with this reality. Especially if there is ideological weakness and the belief in the revolution is shaken, the electoral vote will open the door to reformism wide open.
 </p>
 <p>
  We acted with this understanding during the election process in Dersim. First of all, we want this to be known. We were open to negotiations until the last moment, expecting joint work, and we even had to make a request in this direction. The findings and opinions we will present here are shared as a result of the somehow forced meetings we had with our friends.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dersim was the scene of unsurprising but still interesting developments and discussions. We acted by paying attention to the approaches of our friends to clarify our policy in Dersim due to their originality and long-established relationships. In the end, what we reached was that our friends thought and acted very far away from us, and that they kept their group interests above of the public’s tendencies and expectations; therefore, the conditions for acting together with them are not met. Undoubtedly, the loss and decline of the political cause, which is particularly represented in the DEM Party, is not or will not be a positive situation when we look at it from the perspective of the public’s interests. However, in order for this cause not to regress or even develop, there must be policies, studies and staff suitable for the cause. Developments in this process have shown that we are far from these. We must say that we will not specifically pursue any work against this case, and that our priority is to organize against those who are hostile to the people. We declare that we are not involved in the election process because appropriate steps were not taken for the case and because it was viewed and acted from the perspective of narrow group interests.
 </p>
 <p>
  Our evaluation of the developments and discussions in this process will explain the reason for the stance we have taken.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   LET FRIENDS SEE IN ALLIANCE
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Dersim gains special importance for every political actor, especially when it comes to local elections. For the DEM Party, it is “an important city of Kurdistan that cannot be lost”, in the terms of EMEP [Labor Party] and SMF [Socialist Assemblies Federation] etc. it is “the bastion of socialism.” For former CHP [Republican People’s Party] deputy Hüseyin Aygün and his partners, who will enter the elections as an independent candidate, “Dersim belongs to the people of Dersim, it should be saved from revolutionaries and socialists.” Since H. Aygün and his associates do not have much to consider in terms of the interests of the masses, the possibility of forming an alliance or acting together with this group has not been on our agenda from the very beginning. DEM Party, SMF and EMEP are the friends we address in discussions in this context. Their approaches and general attitudes were monitored and evaluated by us. Of course, we have certain ideas and attitudes about every institution from the very beginning. Accordingly, there are no sufficient conditions for an alliance or joint action in the right direction with both SMF and EMEP in general and especially in Dersim.
 </p>
 <p>
  SMF and EMEP, which determine all their activities according to elections and are actually stuck in an area limited to elections, enter into a fierce fight in every local election. This fight continues from past to present, sometimes between each other and sometimes both together against DEM and its predecessors. When it comes to parliamentary elections, those who get 1-2 seats and easily form an alliance with DEM and its predecessors do not hesitate to shake their swords at each other to get Dersim Municipality. Since they act according to narrow group interests in a line that is far from principles and revolutionary values, their inconsistencies and practices have been developing against the expectations of the people for a long time, and the interests of the people are often not understood or taken into consideration. If you remember, in the parliamentary elections held in 2023, all of the parties and organizations in question established the “Labor and Freedom Alliance”. However, this alliance collapsed just before the elections. However, it was stated by all actors that this alliance would not only be an electoral alliance, but also a struggle alliance.
 </p>
 <p>
  This issue is important because it shows that the basis of the alliances in question is far from revolutionary, democratic principles and understanding, and these alliances are insincere. The coming together of these understandings does not concern the development of the struggle and obtaining permanent results. It is disconnected from the real agenda and problems of the people. Therefore, it is far from developing a solution. It searches for solutions to problems within the system without touching the system. It should be known that the source of the problem is the system itself. A radical solution to the problems is impossible without drying up this resource. That is why, to date, these institutions have not been able to develop a consistent democratic policy in municipal elections and even in “municipalism”.
 </p>
 <p>
  The same result exists today. These understandings, which generally hold the people responsible for every failed practice, have always lagged behind the people, and of course still do today. Our people analyze events and facts more clearly and draw conclusions. The alliance components are tied to each other with a thread. There is an alliance shaped by coercion and “necessity to win”. “Friends should see it while shopping”, our people see the content of this alliance and clearly show their reaction. Of course, it is debatable to what extent it will affect the election results. In conclusion, this reaction is appropriate and justified.
 </p>
 <p>
  Alliance talks are always drowning in candidacy debates and turning into a fight over just this issue. Of course, every political movement can nominate candidates and present them to the alliance. If they are going to enter the elections with an alliance, this issue, namely the candidate issue, cannot be left out of discussion. However, candidates should be the last topic to be discussed in discussions; firstly, it should be understood about the reasons for coming together and what will be done for what purpose. However, this is not what we see in the alliance established in Dersim, it was acted through a bargaining method in which narrow group interests were decisive. It is clear that the revolutionary struggle will not develop and the masses will not be able to organize with these understandings. On the contrary, this situation leads to degeneration in ideology. It deepens the separation from the public.
 </p>
 <p>
  In order to understand what we have stated above, let’s take a look at the events that took place between the institutions as far as we know about the situation that has developed so far during the local elections process.
 </p>
 <p>
  During these elections, both SMF and DEM Party, and EMEP and DEM Party held separate meetings and could not get results from these meetings to form an alliance. From now on, DEM Party shared with the public that it would enter the elections in Dersim with its own candidates. After this statement of the DEM Party, SMF and EMEP made a statement that they had formed an alliance and called on other movements to join this alliance. After the EMEP and SMF alliance was reflected in the public, a statement was made by the DEM Party headquarters and said, “Dersim cannot exist without DEM, and DEM cannot exist without Dersim.” After this statement, mutual discussions started. In the article written by Doğan Durgun in Yeni Yaşam newspaper regarding the alliance established by EMEP and SMF, it was called “Tunçeli alliance” and accusations were made against this alliance by Sırrı Sakık. DEM Party discussed this alliance, which was established despite itself, as a reflection of the “State mentality”. These discussions continued for a few days, and then, with the statements of the party headquarters, it was said that “an alliance was reached in Dersim”. After all the discussions, the parties formed an alliance without developing any self-criticism, which was met with reaction from the people of Dersim.
 </p>
 <p>
  SMF’s “socialist municipalism” adventure, which started in Ovacık, first abandoned Ovacık to the CHP, then came to Dersim Central Municipality, turned the city into rubble in every sense, and shook the people’s trust in the revolutionaries. Then, during this election process, it went to Kadıköy as if it was running away from the people of Dersim. Manipulation of the masses was created with populist discourses such as “socialist municipalism”, “communist president” and “cooperative socialism”. From free transportation to free water, from student scholarships to the development of village agriculture, by creating a misconception with things that were never actually done, it has shaken the public’s trust in the revolutionaries who have been struggling in these lands for half a century. The masses continue to be deceived from “Kaypakkayaism” to the struggle under the social chauvinist TKP flag. The fact that EMEP and DEM Party, which criticized this entire process before, formed an alliance as if nothing had happened, means that they are united in all these negativities.
 </p>
 <p>
  Approving the liquidationist group who use the name “Partizan” to be included in the alliance is another indicator of lack of principle. Our friends continue to ignore the fact that this group cannot represent Partizan. Aside from the fact that the line, understanding and way of existence they defend are incompatible with Partizan’s most well-known principles and historical background, it is obvious that they have no following in Dersim. The main reason for this is the attitude of the people of Dersim regarding who and with what principles Partizan is represented. This attitude has been ignored. The problem is clearly a political one. What is the answer to the question “What is the attitude of Partizan in Dersim?” How to explain the contradiction between what the people of Dersim see and know and what the alliance offers? The answer to this question confirms our explanations on the subject and the criticisms we offer. Based on this concrete reality, we once again invite our friends to take the statement we made regarding the name “Partizan” and the attitude we expect.
 </p>
 <p>
  The name “Partizan” represents a certain line and historical accumulation. The group included in the alliance has broken away from it. We reiterate that addressing this group under the name “Partizan” is unprincipled and incompatible with friendship. We will continue to criticize and reject this wrong attitude in every environment and platform we are in.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   We
  </strong>
  <strong>
   call,
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  It is clear that this alliance of forces that have lost the trust of the people, formed without self-criticism to the people of Dersim and without being held accountable for these negativities, has no future. We did not have an understanding of being a part of alliances based solely on the possibility of winning elections. We share with the public that we have drawn a clear line between ourselves and this alliance, which neglects to take a sincere and honest stance even though a strong and necessary self-criticism is required and it is faced with an intense reaction from the people of Dersim in particular. We call on all our people to take a stand against these wrongs, apart from their election choices, and to be a part of our insistence on a revolutionary attitude and line.

Since then, the conditions necessary to prevent famine have not been met and  the latest evidence confirms that Famine is imminent in the northern governorates and projected to occur anytime  between mid-March and May 2024. CURRENT:  15 FEBRUARY - 15 MARCH 2024             2.13M 95% of the population   analysed People facing high   acute food insecurity   (IPC Phase 3 or above) IN NEED OF URGENT  ACTIONPhase 5 677,000 People in Catastrophe Phase 4 876,000 People in Emergency Phase 3 578,000 People in Crisis Phase 2 96,000 People Stressed Phase 1 0 People in food  security PROJECTED:  16 MARCH - 15 JULY 2024             2.23M 100% of the population   analysed People facing high   acute food insecurity   (IPC Phase 3 or above) IN NEED OF URGENT  ACTIONPhase 5 1,107,000 People in Catastrophe Phase 4 854,000 People in Emergency Phase 3 265,000 People in Crisis Phase 2 0 People Stressed Phase 1 0 People in food  security    IPC ACUTE FOOD INSECURITY ANALYSIS   15 FEBRUARY - 15 JULY 2024   Published on 18 March 2024IPC Global Initiative - Special Brief IPC Special Briefs are produced by the IPC global initiative and do not necessarily reflect the views of stakeholders in Palestine. This analysis  factors in all data and information available up to 10 March 2024 and does not take into account the latest developments on the ground. Key Drivers Restricted humanitarian access Extremely limited humanitarian access to and within the  Gaza Strip continues to impede the safe and equitable  delivery of life-saving multi-sector humanitarian assistance  critical for Famine prevention and response. This includes  severe limitations to the supply of goods as well as basic  services.Hostilities Hostilities continue to involve the besiegement of the  entire population and widespread, intense and sustained  ground and air operations and clashes. This has caused  over 31,000 deaths and injured 73,000 people, displaced  about 1.9 million people, damaged or destroyed over half  of the buildings, and devastated assets and infrastructure  indispensable to survival, including across the food, health  and water systems.Current Acute Food Insecurity | 15 February - 15 March  Projected Acute Food Insecurity | 16 March - 15 July<br> According to the most likely scenario, both North Gaza and Gaza Governorates are classified in IPC Phase 5 (Famine)  with reasonable evidence, with 70% (around 210,000 people) of the population in IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe).   Continued conflict and the near-complete lack of access to the northern governorates for humanitarian organizations  and commercial trucks will likely compound heightened vulnerabilities and extremely limited food availability, access,  and utilization, as well as access to healthcare, water, and sanitation. The famine threshold for household acute food  insecurity has already been far exceeded and, given the latest data showing a steeply increasing trend in cases of acute  malnutrition, it is highly likely that the famine threshold for acute malnutrition has also been exceeded.   In North Gaza,  acute malnutrition (by Mid-Upper Arm Circumference - MUAC) moved from a pre-escalation estimated of 1 percent to 6.8  – 9.1 percent in January and 12.4 to 16.5 percent in February (weighted for children 6-59). Acute malnutrition (by MUAC)  among children 6-23 months old increased in the same period from 16.2 percent to 29.2 percent. The upward trend in  non-trauma mortality is also expected to accelerate, resulting in all famine thresholds likely to be passed imminently.   The southern governorates of Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis, and the Governorate of Rafah, are classified in IPC  Phase 4 (Emergency). However, in a worst-case scenario, these governorates face a risk of Famine through July 2024.  The entire population in the Gaza Strip (2.23 million) is facing high levels of acute food insecurity. From mid-March to  mid-July, in the most likely scenario and under the assumption of an escalation of the conflict including a ground offensive  in Rafah, half of the population of the Gaza Strip (1.11 million people) is expected to face catastrophic conditions (IPC  Phase 5), the most severe level in the IPC Acute Food Insecurity scale. This represents an increase of 530,000 people (92  percent) compared to the previous analysis. Between the current and the projection period, around 400,000 more people  are expected to slide into IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe). The rest of the population faces Emergency (IPC Phase 4) (854,000  people, 38 percent of the population) or Crisis (IPC Phase 3) (265,000 people, 12 percent of the population).  The escalation of the hostilities has caused widespread damage to assets and infrastructure indispensable to survival.  About 50 percent of buildings - and more than 70 percent in the northern governorates - have been damaged or  destroyed. This has included dwellings, shops and infrastructure, such as hospitals, schools, as well as water, sanitation  and other facilities. Assets and infrastructure necessary for food production and distribution have also been destroyed or  severely damaged, extremely limiting the functionality of the food system.  From a pre-escalation average of 500 trucks a day of which 150 carrying food, in the period between 7 October 2023 to  24 February 2024, only 90 trucks per day, of which only 60 carrying food, entered the Gaza Strip. Consequently, virtually  all households are skipping meals every day and adults are reducing their meals so that children can eat. In the northern  governorates, in nearly two thirds of the households, people went entire days and nights without eating at least 10 times  in the last 30 days. In the southern governorates, this applies to one third of the households. <br>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF3 CURRENT SITUATION MAP AND POPULATION TABLE                                                            (15 February - 15 March 2024 ) Population table for the current situation: 15 February - 15 March 2024 Note: A population in Phase 3+ does not necessarily reflect the full population in need of urgent action. This is because some households may be in Phase 2 or even 1 but only because of receipt of  assistance, and thus, they may be in need of continued action. Marginal inconsistencies that may arise in the overall percentages of totals and grand totals are attributable to rounding.GovernorateTotal  population analysedPhase 1 Phase 2 Phase 3 Phase 4 Phase 5 Phase 3+Area  Phase#people % #people % #people % #people % #people % #people % Deir al-Balah  & Khan Younis  governorates600,000 0 030,000 5120,000 20 270,000 45 180,000 30 570,000 95 4 North Gaza  & Gaza  governorates300,000 0 0 0 0 60,000 20 75,000 25 165,000 55 300,000 100 4 Rafah  governorate1,326,544 0 066,327 5397,963 30 530,618 40 331,636 25 1,260,217 95 4 Grand Total 2,226,544 0 096,327 5 577,963 26 875,618 39 676,636 30 2,130,217 95<br>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF4 CURRENT SITUATION OVERVIEW (15 February - 15 March 2024) Vulnerabilities and Acute Events  Prior to the current hostilities, vulnerability was high in the Gaza Strip due to prolonged blockade and periodic escalations  in hostilities that severely damaged the food system in the area. At 5,900 residents per square kilometre, one of the  most densely populated areas in the world even before the concentration of most of the population in only one of five  governorates, the Gaza Strip population is extremely reliant on the cross-border movement of goods and utilities like  electricity and water.  In 2022, the Gaza Strip faced an unemployment rate of nearly  45 percent 1 and, by September 2023, the poverty rate was at 60  percent 2, among a population that included nearly 70 percent of  refugees. 3 Due to severely constrained livelihood opportunities,  in 2022, over half of the population was relying on humanitarian  assistance as their main income source and about one-third on  casual labour, 4 with 70 percent of the population food insecure. 5  Conflict . As of 14 March 2024, the ongoing hostilities have  reportedly caused nearly 105,000 casualties within the Gaza Strip  – nearly 5% of the total population. 6 This includes over 73,000  people injured, about half of them women and children, and  over 31,000 deaths. The escalation of hostilities within the Gaza Strip began with  heavy bombardment on 7 October 2023. 7 On 27 October, major  ground operations and clashes reportedly began within the Gaza  Strip. 8 These started in the northern governorates and continued  through 23 November, with a humanitarian pause from 24  November through 30 November. 9 Hostilities subsequently  resumed at high intensity, with major ground operations and  bombardment by air, land, and sea. This included the continued  expansion of a ground operation in Khan Younis Governorate,  centred on Khan Younis city. 10 Another large ground operation began in Deir al-Balah  Governorate on 24 December 2023, 11 expanding across multiple  though not all refugee camps and urban areas in the governorate.  These operations were accompanied by continued clashes  among armed actors. Clashes in the northern governorates, especially some neighbourhoods of Gaza city like Zeitoun,  re-escalated in late February 2024. 12 Bombardment by air, land, and sea of all areas of the Gaza Strip has continued  throughout this period, intensifying particularly before and during major ground operations. Humanitarian access.  Conflict continues to place severe limitations on the ability of humanitarian organizations to deliver  life-saving food, nutrition, health, water, hygiene, sanitation and other life-saving assistance to the besieged population.  Commercial traffic is similarly impeded. Humanitarian access, and the ability of the most vulnerable populations to access  and participate in humanitarian activities safely is highly limited and uneven across the Gaza Strip. Once humanitarian  assistance and commercial goods enter the Gaza Strip, onward access to the northern governorates is extremely limited  and unavailable for extended periods, while access is relatively higher for the southern governorates, particularly Rafah  Governorate. While there has been improvement in access to the Gaza Strip relative to early October 2023, including  the opening of the Kerem Shalom crossing in Mid-December 2023, access to the Gaza Strip continues to fluctuate and  remains insufficient for meeting the basic needs of the overall population.  Severe limitations and attacks on humanitarian staff and assets forced major providers of humanitarian food and other  assistance to the northern governorates to suspend convoys to these areas, including the World Food Programme, on  20 February. 13 Since the previous IPC analysis on the Gaza Strip in December 2023, access denial increased significantly,  especially in the northern governorates. In January 2024, only nine humanitarian missions to the northern governorates  were facilitated, dropping to six missions in February. 14 Figure 1. Casualties in the Gaza Strip reported by the  Palestinian Ministry of Health as of 14 March 2024.  Source: Health Cluster<br> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF5 According to OCHA, constraints on humanitarian action throughout the Gaza Strip include direct strikes with explosive  weapons on humanitarian convoys, detention of humanitarian staff, road closures, checkpoints, and related blockages  or delays on main transportation corridors. Swarming of humanitarian convoys subsequently increased, including at  several hotspots throughout the Gaza Strip, such as immediately  after crossing Wadi Gaza into the northern governorates.  Physical access constraints further limit the movement of  humanitarian and commercial traffic, including road damage  from bombardment and traffic of heavy military vehicles as well  as the accumulation of an estimated 12,000 metric tons of debris  that may take up to four years to fully clear. 15  Displacement and Movement Restrictions. Displacement  continues to be driven by conflict. An evacuation order was  issued to the entire population residing north of Wadi Gaza  (1.1 million people) on 13 October, 16 followed by orders and  accompanying maps indicating to move as far south as Khan  Younis Governorate. 17 After the humanitarian pause on 24- 30 November 2023, new evacuation orders covering at least   30 percent of the entire Gaza Strip were issued. 18 The unilaterally  declared Al-Mawasi “Humanitarian Zone” was first announced  on 18 October 2023, however, humanitarian agencies did not  agree to the establishment of such zones. 19 The proposed area  has limited pre-existing services, with OCHA reporting there is  “almost no sheltering capacity” . 20  In addition to the closure of some of the main transportation corridors within the Gaza Strip, other movement restrictions  have also been announced, including a ban on movement from southern to northern governorates. 21 Additional  restrictions imposed on populations affect livelihoods and food access, such as a de facto prohibition on fishing and  movement within one kilometre of the border fence, which covers a significant proportion of farmland. 22 The movement  of livestock together with displaced populations has not generally been reported and livestock abandonment is likely  high.Map 1. Missions planned, facilitated and denied, October 2023 to Mid-February 2024. Source: OCHA Map 2. Distribution of IDPs staying in Collective  Centres. Source: Shelter Cluster<br> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF6 As new evacuation orders are issued alongside with continuation of bombardments  and ground operations, Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) are constantly moving  in search of safety. Most of them have moved south, largely to Rafah Governorate. 23  The population in Rafah has increased about five-fold as a result, rapidly rising from  276,000 pre-escalation to over 1.3 million as of February 2024. A large proportion of  the displaced population is from Gaza and North Gaza Governorates, which have  seen their population decrease by 84 percent and 75 percent respectively. 24 Rafah Governorate, which spans over 65 km 2, now hosts around 1.3 million people. 25  In Rafah, there are 35 UNRWA shelters hosting 882,800 people and another 30  informal shelters hosting 506,300 people, 26 corresponding to over 30 percent of  the population staying in shelters. The formal shelters managed by UNRWA are  overcrowded with severely limited access to safe Water, Sanitation and Hygiene  (WASH) and other services. People in informal shelters face even more difficulties  accessing health, food and non-food services. The lack of Non-food Items (NFIs)  provision in informal settlements has led people to set up makeshift shelters and  tents, which are subject to flooding on rainy days, further exacerbating the suffering  of displaced people. 27  Damages . Destruction and damage of buildings, particularly from bombardment  by air, land, and sea, is evident in all governorates of the Gaza Strip. According to  the recent satellite assessments, by late February 2024, at least 54 percent of all  buildings in the Gaza Strip were likely damaged or destroyed. The largest scale  destruction is in Gaza Governorate where more than 73 percent of buildings are  estimated to be destroyed, followed by North Gaza (70 percent), Deir al-Balah (44  percent), Khan Younis (52 percent) and Rafah (28 percent). 28 This has included  dwellings, shops and various types of infrastructure, such as hospitals, schools, and  other public buildings, as well as WASH infrastructure and storage facilities, among  others.  Food Availability Production . The escalation of hostilities and mass  displacements have caused food shortages and  unavailability throughout the Gaza Strip as the food system  and agriculture value chains have collapsed or are marginally  surviving through the informal market. A significant portion  of agriculture land, encompassing orchards, greenhouses,  and farmlands has suffered extensive destruction. According  to the UNOSAT, the percent of damaged agriculture land  has increased from 25 percent to 60 percent, between  November 2023 and January 2024.29  Extensive damage has been inflicted on the local food  system, including agricultural infrastructure. More than 300  home barns, 100 agricultural warehouses, 46 farm storages,  119 animal shelters, 200 farms, as well over 600 wells used for  irrigation have been destroyed, amongst other agriculture  facilities.30 According to the FAO damage assessment of  February 2024, damage to wells was found to be most  concentrated in the North Gaza and Gaza Governorates; and  in some areas, all the wells were damaged. Additionally, over  26 percent (336) of all greenhouses have been damaged  across all governorates. The governorates with the highest Map 3. Gaza Damage Mapping  26.02.2024.

Source: UNOSAT, 2023-2024<br> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF7 damage are Gaza (55 percent), North Gaza (48 percent), Khan Younis (35 percent), Deir al-Balah (20 percent) and Rafah  (16 percent). The Governorate of Khan Younis had the largest area of damaged greenhouses (149 hectares), followed by  Rafah (89 hectares). More than 40 percent (6,694 ha) of all croplands has been damaged since 7 October, with the highest reported damages  in Gaza (55 percent, 1,941 ha), Deir al-Balah (51 percent, 1,408 ha), North Gaza (45 percent, 1,402 ha), Khan Younis (33  percent, 1,492 ha) and Rafah (25 percent, 451 ha) Governorates. In terms of cropland type, 41 percent of irrigated land, 43 percent of orchards and 42 percent of rainfed land have been  damaged.31 The hostilities have not only led to the destruction of agricultural assets and infrastructure, they also resulted  in the displacement of populations away from agricultural land and constrained access for agricultural activities. Other assets and infrastructure necessary for food production and distribution have also been destroyed or severely  damaged, extremely limited the functionality of the food system. Although some local production, primarily of vegetables, is still ongoing, it is very  limited. Lack of access to land and destruction of crops are compounded by a lack of  access to essential agriculture inputs (fuel, seeds, fertilizers, pesticides).  Most livestock were abandoned during the large-scale displacement in October 2023.  Remaining livestock are being slaughtered or sold due to the lack of fodder and water  or due to the need for cash or other resources. Similarly, poultry lack animal feed, and  the availability of poultry meat and eggs is reduced throughout the Gaza Strip.  The comparison among the preliminary reports from the FAO Loss and Damage  assessment and the baseline figure from the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics  (PCBS), shows about 70 percent of livestock and other animals have been lost since 7  October 2024. Fishing production is largely halted due to the damage of boats, lack  of fuel and security/safe access. Some fishing is still happening, but it is only available  to those who still possess equipment and have access to fuel.  Food security assessments indicate32 that, due to the lack of food availability, some  households are resorting to eating wild foods. These range from mallow ( khebbayze  in Arabic) to unconventional food sources such as animal fodder and other unsafe  foods. Figure 2. Overview of the damage to agricultural land and infrastructure due to the conflict in the Gaza Strip as of 15 February  2024. Source: FAO<br> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF8 Imports . Between January and September 2023, a daily average of 150 food trucks entered the Gaza Strip. Between  8 October 2023 and 9 March 2024, this number decreased to an average of 65 trucks per day33 and the availability of  food commodities has dramatically declined. Since the escalation of the hostilities, the number of trucks allowed into  the Gaza Strip has been severely restricted, reducing the inflow of humanitarian assistance and preventing the entry of  commercial goods completely until 8 December 2023. Since then, there was an initial increase in the flow of food and  non-food commodities, facilitated through the opening of a second border crossing (Kerem Shalom).  However, in February, the flow of commodities decreased again and has been intermittent from late January through  February. The month of February in particular saw major variations highlighted in figure 3. The entry of humanitarian and commercial trucks into Gaza is significantly limited to the southern governorates, mainly  Rafah. Conversely, there are very few items reaching the northern governorates and other areas in the rest of the south of  Gaza Strip.34 OCHA estimates that less than 5 percent  of all the food trucks have reached North Gaza and  Gaza Governorates in the past four weeks, while 45  percent remained in Rafah and about 50 percent  reached Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis. An in-depth  analysis of the border crossing manifest allowed to  generate approximate kilocalories values per truck  and per unit of analysis then distributed per area,  using information provided by OCHA and the Food  Security Sector. This reveals that in most days, the  quantity of food translated in kilocalories entering  in Gaza has been extremely below the requirements  in North Gaza Governorates, and mostly half the  requirements in Rafah. The only areas appearing to  have benefited from an almost sufficient amount  of kilocalories (although irregular) are in Khan  Younis and Deir al-Balah Governorates (with higher  quantities in the later). This may suggest that most Figure 3. Reanalysis of food-only trucks entering Gaza through Kerem Shalom and Rafah border crossing. Source: UNRWA Figure 4. Reanalysis of the Kcal availability per unit of analysis.  Source: UNRWA, Gaza Supply and Dispatch  <br> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF9 requirements in Rafah. Based on truck entries into the Gaza Strip from 21 October 2023 to 3 March 2024, the proportion of  average kilocalories per day (using a 7-day rolling average) has been consistently below the daily kilocalorie requirements  (calculated using demographic data considering variations by age and gender), with the exception of a short period of  time around mid-January.  A survey conducted by the World Food Programme (WFP)35 highlights that interviewed shop owners are faced with a  significant shortage of basic food items, with 81 percent indicating depletion. Furthermore, 19 percent highlighted that  the available food items are in short supply, and not expected to last more than a week. The formal market has been  heavily impacted with a non-functioning supply chain, and severely damaged shops. Consequently, the informal market  has surged. Informal markets, provide 1 or 2 types of foods (canned foods mainly), and are supplied by the beneficiaries  of assistance (selling or bartering). The WFP market monitoring indicates that most respondents have stocks inferior to 1  week or inexistent for the vast majority of the food commodities, with the exception of vegetables. All respondents have  exhausted dairy products.36 Despite the presence of at least a hundred bakeries in northern Gaza, few are able to operate due to significant challenges.  The main obstacle is the persistent shortage of flour, other bakery inputs, and fuel. In early January, WFP began supporting  12 bakeries in Rafah and Deir al-Balah.37 Access Market functionality. Informal markets now dominate both food and non-food item transactions across the Gaza Strip as  formal markets have collapsed following the depletion of stocks and damage to primary places of business. Selling and  buying is mostly taking place in the street along with potential barter activities. People, and more particularly vulnerable  groups, are increasingly facing protection risks to access markets with the lack of social order and high levels of food  insecurity. There is a risk associated to transporting and carrying food in the street, especially in Northern Gaza and  Gaza Governorates where people have resorted to going out in groups to buy food and/or carrying knives to protect  themselves. The scarcity of items is driving food prices up and reducing household purchasing power. The overall Consumer Price  index (CPI) was approximately 49 percent higher in December 2023 compared to the onset of the conflict; the CPI for  food and soft drinks was 76 percent higher.38  Food aid.  The flow of humanitarian assistance into and across the Gaza Strip continues to be severely disrupted. Between  1 January and 12 February 2024, 51 percent of aid missions planned for the north of Wadi Gaza and 25 percent of  those planned for the areas requiring coordination south of Wadi Gaza were denied access..39 In February, the UN and its  humanitarian partners planned only 24 missions to areas north of Gaza, of which six (25 percent) were facilitated. This  stands in stark contrast to January, when 61 missions were planned to the north, with nine (15 percent) facilitated.40Figure 5. Stocks availability at shops as of 21 January (% of respondents). Source: WFP<br> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF10 Based on data from UNRWA,41 the maximum number of trucks entering daily from both the Kerem Shalom and the Rafah  crossings was 300 (compared to an average of 500 daily pre-escalation), approximately 70 percent of these trucks carried  food or a mixture of food and non-food items. On 20 February 2024, WFP decided to suspend its food aid deliveries to  northern Gaza as a result of chaos and violence.42 On 5 March, a 14-truck food convoy, the first by WFP to the north since  it paused deliveries on 20 February, was denied access after a three-hour wait at the Wadi Gaza checkpoint and then  looted on its way back.43  On 7 March, 11 food trucks from private sector were allowed to enter. In total, from 5 February to 5 March, 10-15 food  trucks were allowed into the Gaza Governorate to feed about 300,000 people (less than 1 Kg per person for a full month).  Given the spread of the conflict, restrictions on movement and the displacement of the population, the humanitarian  space is constantly decreasing, and humanitarian food assistance is being distributed unequally among areas.  Airdrop operations of food aid along the Gaza Strip coastline began on 26 February 2024. Airdrops mainly consist of  ready-made meals that do not require cooking methods and are of high nutritional value. However, they are erratic,  small-scale, cover a limited geographic area, and are primarily accessible to populations located near the coast, including  those physically able to recover food pallets and packages from the sea in a context of heightened civil unrest. Airdrops  without ground coordination are also dangerous and falling assistance may strike civilians, as occurred on 8 March when Figure 6. Food CPI in Gaza Strip (December 2022 - December 2023). Source: WFP/ PCBS Figure 7. Inflation rate (September 2023 vs. December 2023). Source: WFP/ PCBS<br> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF11 OCHA reported that five civilians died.44 In  light of this, airdrops account for a negligible  share of the humanitarian food security  assistance in the Gaza Strip compared to  what is trucked in overland. Cash Assistance.  The functionality of cash  assistance in the Gaza Strip is limited. As of  15 February 2024, cash actors had delivered  emergency multi-purpose cash assistance  to over 125,000 households (over 828,000  people) since the onset of the conflict.45  According to the most recent Cash Post  Distribution Monitoring,46 about 71 percent  of the respondents reported that the cash  assistance received helped them to either  access urgent/basic items and services  needed. Most expenditures were on food (89 percent), followed by medicines, debt repayment, water and hygiene  products, and transportation. In Rafah, cash liquidity is a significant challenge47 because of the high number of displaced  individuals and the logistical difficulties banks face in transferring cash. Poor electricity supply and connectivity are also  affecting the ability of financial service providers to make cash accessible.   Figure 8. Planned aid missions by month. Source: OCHA  Figure 9a.

Source: UNRWAUtilization  Before the escalation of hostilities, electricity was unreliable and only available for a few hours each day. The lack of  electricity negatively affected all aspects of life, including food safety, and made it almost impossible to operate food  processing units effectively.48 The main water and electricity networks, fuel and food supplies are now almost completely  suspended.49 Frequent communication blackouts make it extremely challenging to coordinate the distribution of aid,  and let people know how to access it, and when.  The complete electricity blackout that began on 11 October 2023 continues, with only limited electricity generated  inside the Gaza Strip from generators and solar panels. Hostilities in the Gaza Strip continue to prevent the delivery of fuel  to the Gaza power plant, which remains non-functioning, and block cross-border electricity distribution.50 This severely  impacts all aspects of daily life, including the processing and storage of food, pumping and distribution of drinking water,  treatment of wastewater, and the functionality of telecommunications and financial systems. <br>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF13 The lack of electricity and damage to telecommunication systems has also limited the ability of populations to  communicate and access information like evacuation orders or humanitarian assistance delivery. There have been rolling  telecommunication blackouts since 7 October, with several lasting around one week.51 Fuel was not permitted to enter the Gaza Strip from 7 October until 15 November 2023. UNRWA reported that for only  the bare minimum of critical services in which it is involved, 160,000 litres per day of diesel fuel are needed. This minimum  requirement, which is still insufficient for a full restoration of humanitarian operations and other basic services, has been  met only about 10 percent of days from 7 October through 9 March. No fuel was permitted to enter the Gaza Strip from  20 December 2023 through 7 January 2024, a period of new or expanding major ground operations, including in Deir  al-Balah and Khan Younis Governorates. From 24 January through 6 March, fuel was permitted to enter the Gaza Strip  only on alternative days.52 Even once inside the Gaza Strip, the onward movement of diesel fuel faces the same extreme  challenges as other humanitarian and commercial goods, with little fuel reaching the northern governorates. Regarding fuel to North Wadi Gaza, two (10 percent) of 21 planned missions were facilitated. Both deliveries were  facilitated to a single hospital, leaving other hospitals and WASH facilities without fuel. For fuel to areas South of Wadi  Gaza, 15 (71 percent) of 21 planned missions to areas requiring coordination were facilitated. A total of 300,600 litres were  delivered. However, convoys to Nasser hospital were denied access five times in a row. Fuel shortages in hospitals force  them to cease most operations and may lead to preventable deaths.53 About 250 tons of cooking gas entered the Gaza Strip per day on average from January to August 2023.54 Daily entry into  the Gaza Strip from 24 November 2023 through 10 March 2024 has consistently been roughly 30-40 percent of that pre- escalation amount.55 This has further challenged the ability of the Gaza Strip population to cook food that they are able  to access, presenting challenges to physical and biological utilization. As of January-February 2024, nearly 80 percent of  the population in all governorates reported using firewood as their primary cooking fuel, covering any form of wood  available. Around 10-15 percent of the population across governorates reported burning waste as their main cooking  fuel, while almost no respondents reported using cooking gas. Between 7 and 10 percent of respondents reported  that there was no cooking fuel available.56 This is a particular concern as these populations face major challenges with  consuming food that they may still have access to, in particular flour.  Stability Continued conflict and worsening acute food insecurity and nutritional status also contribute to civil unrest, which  further lowers the stability of all food security dimensions. Civil unrest is a major challenge to the delivery of humanitarian  assistance and to humanitarian staff, and hampers their ability to reach the people in need as well as for the most  vulnerable to access and make full use of assistance.  Recent deaths related to the airdrops and swarming of the trucks entering the Gaza Strip are key evidence of the level  of desperation and acute hunger among the people of Gaza. These also show that even a minimal degree of order to  facilitate access to food and other essential supplies, such as medicines, cannot be guaranteed, given the absence of  civil authorities or organized police. Social cohesion in Gaza is strained, exposing the most vulnerable, such as children  - particularly those who are unaccompanied, women, the elderly, the chronically ill and people living with disabilities to  extreme levels of food and water deprivation.   Food Security Outcomes The most recent WFP survey relied on data collected through Computer Assisted Telephone Interviews (CATI) between  6 December 2023 and 19 February 2024. The number of observations were: For North Gaza and Gaza Governorates: 104  observations; for Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah Governorates: 369 observations; for Rafah Governorate: 892 observations.  Households were randomly selected from a master list of 320,000 WFP pre-conflict beneficiary households representing  80 percent of the total pre-conflict population in the Gaza Strip. Overall, 10,320 households were selected and called.  Of them, 1,365 respondents completed the questionnaires (success rate of 13.3 percent - in line with the 10 percent  to 20 percent typical of CATI analyses in the region), while 19 (0.2 percent) answered the call but hung-up and did not  complete it. The rest did not answer.57<br>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF14 Food Consumption Score (FCS). According to the survey, most households across the Gaza Strip have inadequate food  consumption with almost 88 percent of households in the North reporting Poor Food consumption (indicative of IPC  Phase 4 and 5, Emergency and Catastrophe) and 9 percent reporting Borderline food consumption (indicative of IPC  Phase 3, Crisis). An additional disaggregation of the FCS ‘poor’ category (<14) shows that in the North Gaza Governorates,  36 percent of the respondents are not even able to eat cereals daily. In Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah around 53 percent of  households reported poor consumption and 31 percent reported borderline consumption, among them 11 percent had  a value below 14. In Rafah, around 48 percent of households reported poor food consumption and 31 percent reported  borderline consumption of which 5 percent had a value below 14.58 Across all governorates, the food consumption  gaps are clear as most households are unable to consume cereals daily. In the north, the mean number of days of cereal  consumption is 4.4 per week, in Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah Governorates and Rafah Governorate the mean number  of days is 5.14 and 5.15, respectively. Consumption of protein rich food is extremely low in Northern Gaza at 0.33 days a  week and a little over one day a week in the rest of the Gaza Strip.  Reduced Coping Strategy Index (rCSI). Results from reduced coping strategies index indicates that nearly 100 percent of  respondents in the Gaza Strip are engaging in extreme coping strategies. The indicator assesses the frequency with which  households resorted to coping strategies that altered their consumption patterns such as reducing meals, restricting  consumption by adults for children to eat, and borrowing food, in the previous week to cover gaps in their consumption.  Household Hunger Scale (HHS). An increase in the proportion of households facing extreme food consumptions gaps is  observed across all analysed governorates when compared with November 2023 data. About 84 percent of households  in Northern Gaza (Gaza and North Gaza) experienced ‘very severe hunger’ , indicative of IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe), while  8 percent of households reported ‘severe hunger’ , indicative of IPC Phase 4 (Emergency). Compared with the previous  survey round, the deterioration has been significant. In November the proportion of households with ‘very severe hunger’  was estimated at 40 percent showing a doubling of households facing extreme food consumption gaps indicative of IPC  Phase 5 (Catastrophe). In Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis Governorates, 57 percent of households reported experiencing  ‘very severe hunger’ , while 24 percent reported to experience ‘severe hunger’ , compared with November 2023 when only  22 percent of households faced ‘very severe hunger’ . In Rafah, the proportion households reportedly experiencing ‘very  severe hunger’ was 56 percent and 21 percent reporting ‘severe hunger’ .59 Livelihood coping. Some indirect evidence on livelihood coping mechanisms was collected focusing on emergency  strategies contextualised for the very specific conditions of Gaza. The data indicates the highest use of extreme coping  strategies in the North with 18 percent of households reporting that they bartered/exchanged clothing for food, while  12 percent reported begging for food. As estimated 3 percent reported scavenging due to lack of food, and 18 percent  reported gathering wild foods. Around 23 percent reported looting food from debris, and 74 percent indicated that  they sought food outside their shelter, facing potential security risks. In Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis, the reported  proportions were similar: 24 percent of households reported that they bartered/exchanged clothing for food, and in  Rafah the proportion was 27 percent. Around 7 percent in Khan Younis, Deir al-Balah and Rafah Governorates reported  begging for food. An estimated 1.8 percent reported scavenging due to lack of food and 15 percent gathering wild foods.  Around 5 percent in Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah Governorates, and 6 percent in Rafah Governorate reported looting  food from debris. Finally, 65 percent of the households in Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis Governorates, and 59 percent in  Rafah Governorate reported that they sought food outside their shelter facing potential security risks. The survey detected  a high level of non-applicable strategies, which might indicate the pure exhaustion of these coping mechanisms.  Household Economy Approach (HEA) Outcome Analysis (OA): Preliminary HEA Outcome Analysis was made available  by FEWS NET for this IPC analysis. For the northern governorates (North Gaza and Gaza urban area), for the period of  February – August 2024, all the wealth groups categories living in these governorates are expected to face high level of  Survival Deficits (SD), indicative of an IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe). The SD is calculated compared to a survival threshold  defined as the amount of food and cash income needed by the households to meet the 2,100 Kcal per day per person. This  also include the cost of preparing and consuming food plus any cash expenditure on water for human consumption.60  The only exception in these results appear for the Better Off (BO) wealth group living in the Semi Agriculture Gaza (SAG)  livelihood zone with livelihoods more related to crops sales, livestock sales or self-employment, that will experience SD  Indicative of an IPC Phase 4 (Emergency), at the limit of an IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe). For Southern Gaza, the level of  deficit for the projected period of April – August 2024 for the households living in urban areas (URB livelihood zone), will  be indicative of an IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe). For the households living in this governorate with livelihoods more related  to agricultural labour, crop and livestock sales or self-employment, (SAG livelihood zone) – that represent a small portion  of the population living in this governorate -, the Very Poor and the Poor wealth groups will face SD indicative of an IPC <br>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF15 Figure 11.

This last  deficit is calculated compared to a Livelihood Protection basket that include all the sources of food and income needed  for the households to maintain their local livelihoods.  Gender lens.  Food insecurity has a multidimensional impact on women, as it not only relates to unequal access to,  distribution of, consumption of, and control over food, but it also has long-term health and safety risks.  UN Women data  shows that the escalation in food insecurity has also increased the vulnerability of women to food insecurity. More than  4 out of 5 women (84 percent) interviewed by UN Women report that their family eats half or less of the food they used  to before the conflict  began, with mothers and adult women being those tasked with sourcing food, yet eating last,  less, and least than everyone else. Moreover, 4 in 5 women (84 percent) in Gaza indicate that at least one of their family  members had to skip meals during the past week. In 95 percent of those cases, mothers are the ones going without food,  skipping at least one meal to feed their children. Nearly 9 in 10 women (87 percent) report finding it harder to access food  than men. Some women are now resorting to extreme coping mechanisms, such as scavenging for food under rubble  or in dumpsters.<br>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF16Area Governorate % of total Gaza populationURB LZ SAG LZ % of governorate HHs with kcal gaps indicative  of IPC 5 % of area (northern/southern) with kcal gaps  indicative of IPC 5Estimated % of population in the LZ  (URB) Very Poor (24% of the LZ population)  Survival Deficit (SD), Indicative IPC Phase Poor (33%) SD, Indicative IPC Phase Middle (41%) SD, Indicative IPC Phase Better Off (4%) SD, Indicative IPC Phase Estimated % of population in the LZ  (SAG) Very Poor (32%) SD, Indicative IPC Phase Poor (37%) SD, Indicative IPC Phase Middle (25%) SD, Indicative IPC Phase Better Off (7%) SD, Indicative IPC Phase SCENARIO 1 (FEBRUARY - AUGUST 2024) SCENARIO 1 (FEBRUARY - AUGUST 2024)Northern Gaza North Gaza5% 100%85%,  Phase 585%,  Phase 587%,  Phase 555%,  Phase 50% N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A 100,0%Gaza5% 94%85%,  Phase 585%,  Phase 587%,  Phase 555%,  Phase 56%86%,  Phase 587%,  Phase 584%,  Phase 549%,  Phase 4100%Southern Gaza Deir al Balah (or  middle Gaza)10% 99% N/A N/A N/A N/A 1% N/A N/A N/A N/ATo be  inferred To be inferred based on Khan Younis and Deir al Balah assumptions  and convergence of other data higlighting where and to what  extent conditions resemble Rafah vs. Northern GazaKhan  Younis21% 99% N/A N/A N/A N/A 1% N/A N/A N/A N/ATo be  inferredRafah59% 97%33%  survival  deficit,  Phase 432%  survival  deficit,  Phase 445%  survival  deficit,  Phase 427%  survival  deficit,  Phase 43%13%  survival  deficit,  100%  liveli - hoods  pro- tection  deficit,  Phase 30%  survival  deficit,  89%  liveli - hoods  pro- tection  deficit,  Phase 30%  survival/ liveli - hoods  pro- tection  deficit,  Phase 10% survival/ liveli - hoods  pro- tection  deficit,  Phase 10,0% SCENARIO 2 (APRIL - AUGUST 2024) SCENARIO 2 (APRIL - AUGUST 2024)simulation -  Rafah invasion 59% 97%67% 64% 63% 54% 3%42% 31% 0% 0%  Phase 5 Phase  5 Phase 5 Phase  5Phase 4 Phase 4 Phase 1 Phase 1<br>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF17 NUTRITION SITUATION Inadequate dietary intake According to the Nutrition Vulnerability and Situation Analysis conducted by the Global Nutrition Cluster in December  2023-January 2024,61 in North Gaza, 98 percent of the children (47 observations) included in the analysis had consumed  two or fewer food groups in the 24 hours preceding the survey. Among the main food groups reported, breastmilk was  mentioned for 39 children (83 percent), and eggs for 17 (36 percent). The consumption of all the other food groups,  such as legumes, vitamin A rich fruits and vegetables, other vegetables, grains, meat and dairy products, had almost  completely disappeared from their daily diet, indicating an extremely worrying situation in terms of diet quality. 95  percent of the pregnant and breastfeeding women had consumed two or fewer food groups the previous day. The  main food groups mentioned were non-vitamin A rich vegetables, grains and eggs. This situation highlights critically  insufficient micronutrient intake before and during pregnancy and breastfeeding, which can affect both women and the  development of their infants.  In Khan Younis, 90 percent of young children and pregnant and breastfeeding women consumed two food groups or  fewer in the last 24 hours. For young children, the food groups most frequently mentioned were breastmilk and eggs,  while grains, pulses and eggs were the food groups most frequently mentioned for pregnant and breastfeeding women.  In Deir al-Balah, 86 percent of young children had eaten two or fewer food groups during the day before the survey, while  only 3 percent had consumed five food groups. The food groups most consumed were breastmilk, followed by eggs and  grains. Among pregnant and breastfeeding women, 67 percent consumed only one food group the day preceding the  survey, while 26 percent consumed two food groups. Pulses, grains and other vegetables were the food groups most  frequently mentioned by respondents.  In Rafah, 88 percent (UNICEF) – 89 percent (CATI) of young children had consumed two or fewer food groups within the  past 24 hours, breastmilk, eggs and grains were the main food groups consumed by young children. Only 3 percent had  eaten more than two food groups in the last 24 hours.  Infant and young child feeding practices Neonates face deteriorating nutritional status if mothers are unable to breastfeed due to stress, poor mental health and/ or inadequate breastfeeding privacy, and lack of counselling and support by healthcare providers.62 Further, the high pre- conflict prevalence of formula use among Gazans (58 percent among under six-month-old infants) raises concerns with  regards to potential supply disruptions. Under poor WASH conditions, keeping formula water, teats, and bottles sterile  is very challenging. These disruptions can result in increased incidence of diarrhoea and other infectious diseases, both  of which further exacerbate malnutrition. The prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding is projected to average between 25  percent to 35 percent under a ceasefire scenario (lower than the pre-conflict baseline of 42 percent, reflecting ongoing  disruptions including overcrowding and worsened mental health), falling to 20 percent to 30 percent under a status quo  scenario and 5 percent to 15 percent under the escalation scenario. These disruptions have enduring consequences on  infant and child health. Based on interviews that WFP conducted with eight key informants (four interviews were held  on 11 January, and the remaining interviews were conducted on 22-23 January), widespread weight loss, diseases, and  malnutrition prevail due to insufficient food supplies, intensifying the health crisis in the Gaza Strip.63  Health There are now only four hospitals and two clinics remaining in Gaza Governorate and two hospitals and two clinics in  North Gaza. All of them operate at a very low level and information on the health status of children under five is close to  absent. The survey conducted did not reach a minimum sample allowing exploitation of the information.  In Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah Governorates, according to the Nutrition Vulnerability and Situation Analysis, more  than 97 percent of children under five reported having had one or more diseases in the past two weeks. 56 percent  of the children under five had experienced Acute Respiratory Infections within the past two weeks, 70.5 percent had  experienced diarrhoea, and 82.3 percent had had a fever. This shows the extremely critical health conditions children  face, exposing them to high-risk nutritional deterioration. Trends from WHO corroborate these findings, showing a 55  percent increase in diarrhoea cases in children under five between November-December 2023. While the three hospitals  in the Governorate of Deir al-Balah were still operational in late November, nine of the 16 Primary Health Care Centres  (PHCCs) were no longer functioning, seriously impeding access to health services. On average, 0.49 litres of drinking water <br>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF18 was available per person per day in the households surveyed, which is far from the minimum humanitarian standard (2L/ person/day).35 The scale of needs is staggering with 100 percent of the 49 households in need of food and hygiene items,  78 percent in need of water, 69 percent shelter, and 65 percent health assistance.  In Rafah, the Nutrition Vulnerability and Situation Analysis also shows extreme health conditions with almost 93 percent  of children under five having one or more disease within the past two weeks, 79 percent had had a fever and 56 percent  had experienced vomiting. The level of diarrhoea is extremely critical with 70 percent of children under five having had  one episode in the past two weeks, and almost 60 percent having ARI (Acute Respiratory Infection).64  Since mid-October, 388,200 cases of acute respiratory infections have been recorded, along with 246,000 cases of diarrhea  and 3,300 cases of bloody diarrhea, 84,000 cases of skin rashes, 12,000 cases of Acute Jaundice (including confirmed  Hepatitis A).65 As per OCHA, 1.9 million IDPs face at high risk of communicable disease due overcrowding of IDP sites and  lack of access to proper water sanitation and hygiene facilities.66 In Gaza, cases of Hepatitis A have been confirmed in  January 2024 and WHO warned that inhumane living conditions will enable Hepatitis A to continue to spread.67  Health system functionality.  In February 2024, attacks against healthcare facilities, infrastructure and services continued  resulting in 58 percent of the hospitals are not functioning in the Gaza Strip, especially in the northern governorates  (75 percent of the hospitals not functioning). According to the Health Cluster, as of 5 March 2024, only 2 hospitals and  no Primary Health Care Centres were fully functioning; 14 hospitals and 20 Primary Health Care Centres were partially  functioning; while 23 hospitals and 62 Primary Health Centres were not functioning. Only 141 medical points in shelters  were available, while 264 informal, public and UNRWA shelters did not have a medical centre available.68 In the northern governorates, hospitals have been offering limited maternity, trauma, surgery and emergency care services.  They also face challenges such as a shortage of medical staff, including specialized surgeons, neurosurgeons, and intensive  care staff, as well as a lack of medical supplies, and have an urgent need for fuel, food, and drinking water.69 In Deir al-Balah  and Khan Younis, according to OCHA, since January 2024, three hospitals – Al Aqsa, Nasser, and Gaza European – were at  risk of closure due to the issuance of evacuation orders in adjacent areas and the ongoing conduct of hostilities nearby. In  Rafah, 5 hospitals are still functioning. The influx of IDPs migrating to Rafah has overwhelmed the bed availability in hospitals,  leading to insufficient capacity to meet the healthcare needs of the population. There is also high need for primary health  services in informal shelters hosting IDPs. The continued besiegement around some hospitals is significantly affecting their  case management capacity. Referring patients outside of Gaza remains a challenge, as the waiting list continues to grow.70 In addition, people are unable to effectively access healthcare due to the lack of laboratory equipment and reagents  needed for accurate diagnosis and testing.71 The risk to public health is intensified due to an acute scarcity of hygiene  materials and adequate sanitation infrastructure. Persistent anecdotal reports of Hepatitis A cases in Gaza, as recorded  by UNRWA and the Health Cluster, highlight ongoing concerns. Limited access to proper WASH facilities is hindering  prevention of diseases. The high number of surgeries and procedures has led to increased demand for anaesthetic and  analgesic medications which are in short supply. Blood and blood products in hospitals are needed for emergencies and  medical procedures to ensure that patients receive timely transfusions.72  Figure 1. Gaza disease surveillance Source: WHO, Health Cluster<br> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF19 UNRWA stocks of medicines continue to decrease, with around 15 days’ supply remaining overall and one week’s supply  of insulin; some items may run out sooner based on needs at shelters. Therefore, there is an urgent need to restock  medical supplies given the depletion of stocks in the local market. Stocks of fuel and medicines continue to be at risk  of depletion halting UNRWA operations at the health centres. Essential medicines and other critical medical supplies  remain difficult to bring into the Gaza Strip due to strict control of allegedly dual-use items at border crossings and wider  challenges with importing controlled drugs. As basic and specialty healthcare services in Gaza continue to deteriorate,  an increase in excess deaths due to traumatic injuries that would otherwise be survivable with timely and appropriate  care is expected.   In December 2023, UNICEF delivered 962,550 doses of essential vaccines, including for measles, pneumonia, and polio.  Opening of stabilization centres for acute malnutrition cases with medical complications are also planned notably in Tal  as Sultan (Rafah) and another in one of the field hospitals.73 Heightened insecurity and limited access to health facilities  continue to present major challenges for partners to respond and partner operations continue to be negatively affected  by the displacement of staff, social stresses and telecommunication challenges.74   Water, sanitation, and hygiene  Prior to the escalation of hostilities, the majority of the water supply in the Gaza Strip came from groundwater sources  and the rest (around 20 percent) from desalination plants and cross border pipelines. The over pumping of groundwater  in Palestine led to severe water pollution and salinization, especially in the Gaza Strip. More than 97 percent of the water  pumped from the coastal aquifer in the Gaza Strip did not meet the water quality standards set by WHO (PCBS and PWA,  2021).75 Figure 13.

In 2019, the daily allocation of water  per capita for domestic purposes was 77 litres/  capita in the Gaza Strip.77 Taking the high  percentage of water pollution in the Gaza Strip  and calculating the quantity of water suitable  for human use, the per capita share of fresh  water was 22.4 litres per day.78 Damage to WASH facilities.  Based on satellite  damage assessments on WASH infrastructure  dated 21 February,79 13 percent of all sewage  and water facilities have been destroyed (7  percent and 14 percent respectively), while  in total over 56 percent have been either  destroyed or damaged (13 percent and 34  percent respectively). Another 11 percent are  assessed to have possible damage. Overall, this  assessment identifies 77 facilities destroyed  and 254 facilities damaged, with another 67  facilities with possible damage. Northern  Gaza and Gaza Governorates have the highest  concentration of reported damaged or  destroyed infrastructure.  The functionality of, or access to, the 194  facilities (38 and 156 respectively) that were  found with no visible damage is conditional  to access to fuel and spare parts, which are  in very limited supply, as well as availability  of technicians and access to areas with  these assets. The combined damaged and  conditional access to the remaining WASH  infrastructure is expected to have a profound  impact on the availability of water, water  quality and presence of unsafe water or contaminants for populations in these areas. Water availability and drinking water. Water availability continues to be a major concern across the Gaza Strip. In  February 2024, the water produced from all the water sources in Gaza accounted for only 5.7 percent of the pre-escalation  production levels.80 According to OCHA, only 17 percent of the 284 groundwater wells are operating with limited hours  and 39 wells have been reported as destroyed and 93 as moderately to severely damaged.81 Still according to OCHA,  only one of the three cross border water pipelines is operating, functioning at 47 percent of its capacity. Plans to repair  the non-functioning pipelines face challenges in terms of access, communication, or repair coordination considering the  current context. The United Arab Emirate’s small desalination plant located on the Egyptian side of Rafah, operates at full  capacity, providing 2,400 cubic metres per day, following the construction of a 3-kilometre transmission line. In addition,  only two out of the three main water desalination plants are partially functional, mainly in the southern governorates.82   Water quality appears low due to lack of processing facilities or other way of contamination.  According to another study (sample size of 1,200 people)83 conducted in the Gaza Strip in February 2024, access to water  for drinking, bathing and cleaning, is estimated at 1.5 litre per person per day compared to the 15 litres minimum amount  of water required for survival as per as the international SPHERE standards. Similar results from the WASH cluster rapid  assessment conducted in 41 sites indicate a median value of 2 litres per person per day.84 Water production and distribution is a fuel intensive process and the overall WASH fuel allocation is currently 30,000 litres  per day. From 24 January through 4 March, the WASH sector in the Gaza Strip accounted for 30 percent to 60 percent Map 5. WASH facilities damaged, February 2024. Source: WASH Cluster<br> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF21 of all fuel entering the Gaza Strip, with limitations on diesel fuel entry a major impediment to meeting minimum water  requirements throughout the Gaza Strip, especially in the northern governorates.85 In the northern governorates, water supply remains limited and no access to clean water has been reported.86 According  to OCHA, as of 12 January 2024, the combination of water trucking, water from the functional desalination plant, and the  restoration of one of the three main water supply lines on 30 December 2023, has yielded only seven percent of water  production in Gaza, compared with the pre-October 2023 supply.87 In Rafah Governorate, according to the WASH cluster rapid assessment, the majority of the sites rely mainly on water  trucking and piped water in scattered sites, and collective centres rely more heavily on wells.88 More than half of the  sites provide water that is unsafe for drinking (67 percent in collective centres) and only 12 percent can provide water  treatment at source. According to the Euromed study, in Rafah Governorate out of the 15 litres minimum amount of  water a day required as per sphere standard, only 8 litres are available on average across sites (3 litres in collective centres),  with a median of 2 litres per person per day, indicating high level of disparities among sites. Hygiene.  According to the WASH cluster, in Rafah, 61 percent of the sites in collective centres and 71 percent in scattered  sites have no shower89 and the average number of showers per person is about 3,500 in collective centres and 1,050 in  scattered sites. Access and protection of most vulnerable population is also of high concern, with only 12 percent of the  showers being accessible for people living with disabilities and only 24 percent of the sites having separated showers for  women (14 percent in collective centres).  Figure 15. Quantity and type of water sources per site. Source: WASH cluster<br> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF22 An NRC assessment90 conducted in nine shelters in Rafah also stated that every assessed location had reported cases of  “hepatitis A, gastroenteritis, diarrhoea, smallpox, lice, [and] influenza.”  Solid Waste Management. In terms of waste management, most of the wastewater treatment systems have been  suspended and non-functioning since November 2023, due to damage, lack of fuel/power supply, and lack of  maintenance.91 Regarding solid-waste management, which was already a crucial issue before the escalation, the last  UNRWA update on 16 January states that solid waste management continues in Rafah and Khan Younis Governorates  and partially in Deir al-Balah Governorate, where approximately 45 truck loadings were transferred to temporary sites.92  However, according to the WASH cluster,93 93 percent of the sites (89 percent in collective centres and 100 percent in  scattered sites) have some type of visible waste, mainly solid waste or trash and 68 percent of all the sites present informal  or uncontrolled dumping areas. The accumulation of tens of thousands of tons of solid waste on the streets, around  hospitals, IDP shelters, and various random dump sites, represent high public health risks. The Gaza Municipality also  estimates that approximately 50,000 tons of solid waste remain unmanaged.94Figure 16. Quantity and type of water sources per site. Source: WASH cluster Figure 17. Waste management. Source: WASH Cluster<br> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF23 Sanitation. Sanitation situation continues to deteriorate and remains a major issue in all governorates. Despite significant  efforts by UNICEF and its partners to construct family latrines, sanitation coverage remains very low and efforts to increase  coverage are hindered by a lack of cement and other construction materials, including due to constraints on the entry of  items considered to be dual use into the Gaza Strip.95  With wastewater treatment plants non-functioning and many sewage facilities destroyed, especially in Gaza city, flooding  has been a major health hazard through the rainy period as floodwater mixes with untreated sewage in urban areas with  dense displaced populations.96 This is further compounded by the enduring fuel shortage, which impedes the operation  of remaining sewage stations and wastewater treatment plants. According to the WASH Cluster, there is also an increasing  concern about the potential for additional flooding of already contaminated rainwater harvesting lagoons, particularly if  rainfall intensifies. This situation poses a critical threat to both the environment and public health.97 In early 2023, UNICEF  reported that “insufficient safely managed water supply to households, poor sanitation, limited public WASH services, and  risk of flooding expose 1.36 million Palestinians to water-related diseases risks” .98 The situation is exacerbated by continuous restricted access to essential sanitation supplies and services in Gaza.99 The  inability to transport sufficient fuel into the Gaza Strip, and especially to the northern governorates, also significantly  compounds the challenges faced by the WASH response.100  A rapid assessment of displacement sites, including scattered sites and collective centres, in Rafah Governorate was  conducted by the WASH cluster in February 2024.101 63 percent of assessed sites reportedly had access to a sewer  connection (78 percent in collective centres and 36 percent in scattered sites). Few sites reported using buckets/plastic  bags, flush to open drain, septic tank, or flush to elsewhere as a sanitation facility. The median number of persons per  toilet across all sites was 341, though 994 in collective centres and 57 in scattered sites. 80 percent of the 41 sites had  non-functional latrines (74 percent in collective centers and 93 percent in scattered sites). Only 15 percent of sites had  handwashing facilities near latrines. 24 percent of assessed sites offered safe and private latrine access and 51 percent  had separate facilities for men and women. Sanitation facilities in collective centres and informal sites are overcrowded also due to the high number of displaced  populations. According to UNRWA, on average, there are 1,109 IDPs per toilet in shelters in Rafah Governorate, 619 IDPs  per toilet in shelters in Deir al-Balah Governorate, and 1,349 IDPs per toilet in Khan Younis Governorate.102 UNRWA also  reports that there are at least 486 people per toilet in UNRWA shelters in Rafah Governorate.103 Figure 18. Sanitation quantities. Source: WASH Cluster<br> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF24 Figure 19. Sanitation facilities. Source: WASH Cluster Summary of Acute Malnutrition Drivers  According to the Nutrition Vulnerability Study,104 conducted by the Global Nutrition Cluster, over 90 percent of children  aged 6-23 months and pregnant and breastfeeding women are eating two or fewer food groups each day, often those  of the lowest nutritional value. At least 90 percent of children under five have had at least one infectious disease, with 70  percent having had diarrhoea in the previous two weeks. Against a minimum standard of 15 litres per person, 81 percent  of households lack safe and clean water, with average daily household access to water reportedly less than one litre per  person per day. This extreme lack of safe water access is especially concerning for the greater number of infants now  reliant on infant formula than before the most recent escalation. Low clean water availability and access further exposes  young children to infection and subsequently malnutrition. Figure 20: Acute malnutrition drivers. Source: Global Nutrition Cluster<br> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF25 Nutrition Outcomes There is very limited data on acute malnutrition available in Gaza since the start of the conflict on 7 October 2023. The  only data that is available on acute malnutrition as of 9 Mar 2024 come from Mid-Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC)  screenings conducted in the three IPC AFI units of analysis, i.e. northern, middle and southern governorates. While some  screenings included children 6-59 months, others almost exclusively measured only children between 6 and 23 months  of age. Additionally, although some screenings contained individual MUAC and age data, others only had MUAC data at  aggregate level. Of the screening data made available for the analysis, one set only included 45 children and therefore  was not considered in the analysis. The remaining screening datasets were analysed as follows: Figure 21. Metadata, MUAC screening results. Source: Various - reanalysis conducted by the Global Smart Team For every screening that contained only aggregate MUAC data on children 6-59 months, first, unweighted prevalence  estimates were calculated for the following age groups: (i) 6-59 months, (ii) 6-23 months, and (iii) 24-59 months. Secondly,  weighted prevalence of MUAC among children between 6-59 months were calculated from the unweighted prevalence  estimates of children 6-23 months and 24-59 months by applying weights of 0.33 and 0.66,105 respectively. Finally, the  weighted prevalence estimates of 6-59 months were compared with the IPC Acute Malnutrition (IPC AMN) reference  table and the IPC AMN Phases were determined. For each screening that only contained aggregate MUAC data on children 6-23 months, the MUAC prevalence of children  between 23-59 months and weighted prevalence of MUAC among children 6-59 months were estimated using the  following procedure. First, using data from screenings that contained MUAC data on children 6-59 months, the ratio  between the MUAC prevalence of 6-23 months and 24-59 months was determined (this ranged from 3.07 to 9.68).  Secondly, using sensitivity analysis, expected ranges of MUAC prevalence among children between 24-59 months were  calculated using the lowest (3.07) and the highest (9.68) empirically observed ratios. Thirdly, a weighted analysis was  performed, and a range of weighted prevalence estimates of children 6-59 months were obtained. Finally, the weighted  prevalence estimates of 6-59 months were compared with the IPC Acute Malnutrition (IPC AMN) reference table and the  possible IPC AMN Phases were determined.<br> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF26 In conclusion:     •   In North Gaza Governorate , MUAC screenings are indicative of an IPC Acute Malnutrition Phase 2 - 3 (Alert  - Critical) in January, having rapidly deteriorated to an indicative IPC AMN Phase of 4 - 5 (Critical - Extremely  Critical) in February 2024.     •   In Khan Younis Governorate, MUAC screenings are indicative of an IPC Acute Malnutrition Phase 3 - 4 (Serious -  Critical) in February 2024.      •   In Deir al-Balah Governorate, MUAC screenings are indicative of an IPC Acute Malnutrition Phase 1 - 2 (Acceptable  - Alert) in February – early March 2024.      •   In Rafah Governorate, MUAC screenings are indicative of an IPC Acute Malnutrition Phase 1 - 2 (Acceptable - Alert)  in late January – early March. Figure 22. MUAC screening results. Source: Various - reanalysis  conducted by the Global Smart Team<br> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF27 Mortality The analysis could not benefit from representative evidence of non-trauma mortality as intended by IPC Protocols (Crude  Death Rate and Under Five Death Rate). The data available consisted in death counts issued by the Gaza Ministry of Health  and reported by the Health Cluster, and interview data collected during CATI surveys conducted by WFP . Furthermore, a  study on mortality and public health106 was conducted to inform humanitarian and other decision-makers working on  the Gaza crisis by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and the Center for Humanitarian Health at Johns  Hopkins University (LSHTM).  The mortality data collected by the Ministry of Health are not disaggregated by area and appears to only be those  attributable to conflict related violence. The WFP CATI survey data results can be disaggregated by area but not by cause  of death. Therefore, no direct measurements of CDR or U5DR after trauma exclusion are currently available. Nonetheless, it worths noticing that the modelled projections published by LSHTM, while considered useful for  indicating the expected direction of travel and scale of the expected excess mortality, the IPC Famine Review Committee  (FRC) found some of the assumptions factored in the study published in early February might have evolved in different  directions, especially regarding food intake estimates and acute malnutrition.   The absence of usable mortality data in  both governorates leaves a high degree of uncertainty on the translation of these acute malnutrition rate into children  and adult mortality in the current period in North Gaza. It is likely that these extreme levels of malnutrition have not yet  translated into 2/10,000/day Crude Death Rate. The likelihood of having surpassed U5DR thresholds (4/10,000/day for  children) is higher but impossible to ascertain. <br>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF28 PROJECTED SITUATION MAP AND POPULATION TABLE                                                            (16 March - 15 July 2024 ) Note: A population in Phase 3+ does not necessarily reflect the full population in need of urgent action.

Famine is imminent and likely to occur within the next two months.  The Governorates of Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis, and the  Governorate of Rafah, are classified in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency).   During the projection period (16 March - 15 July), in the most likely  scenario and under the assumption of an escalation of the conflict  including a ground offensive in Rafah, half of the population of  the Gaza Strip (1,107,000 people) is expected to face IPC Phase 5  (Catastrophe), the most severe level in the IPC Acute Food Insecurity  scale. The rest of the population is likely to be either in Emergency (IPC  Phase 4) (854,000 people, 38 percent of the population) or in Crisis  (265,000 people, 12 percent of the population). During this period, the  whole population of the Gaza Strip (2,230,000 people) will face high  levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above). North Gaza and Gaza Governorates In the most likely scenario, the North Gaza and Gaza Governorates  are classified in IPC Phase 5 (Famine), with reasonable evidence.  Famine is imminent and likely to occur within the next two months.   In terms of magnitude, 70 percent of the population is likely to be in  IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe) and 30 percent in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency). Continued conflict and the near-complete lack of access to the  northern governorates for humanitarian organizations and commercial  trucks will likely compound heightened vulnerabilities and extremely  limited food availability, access, and utilization, as well as access to  healthcare, water, and sanitation services. People’s ability to exit the  northern governorates and move to locations with relatively greater  food availability and access is likely to be very limited. Within the north, displacements are likely to remain frequent and  localized; yet conditions in the shelters will continue to deteriorate,  including extreme deprivation of basic needs.  As food stocks or sources (wild foods, livestock, or other types of food  – from domestic stocks, shelters or agricultural assets) will continue to  reduce, food availability is expected to be limited. With the very few  humanitarian and commercial trucks entering these governorates,  it is unlikely that households will be able to restock or stabilize their  food consumption patterns. Due to scarce food availability, the vast  majority of markets are either not functioning or availing very few Assumptions for the most likely scenario  in North Gaza and Gaza Governorates Conflict:  In the most likely scenario, the pop - ulation will likely remain fully exposed and  highly susceptible to conflict. Conflict and  related casualties will likely continue at simi - lar levels to January-February 2024, including  the wider besiegement, neighbourhood-lev - el clearing operations, occasional armed  actor clashes, and a comparable rate of  bombardment (air, land, sea). Basic services  infrastructure will likely remain extremely de - graded, and the proportion of all buildings  damaged or destroyed will likely continue to  steadily approach 100%. Humanitarian access to provide food, water,  medicines, and provision of health and  WASH services:  The northern governorates  are likely to be mostly inaccessible and  intermittently hard-to-reach, given continued  ground operations, bombardment (air, land,  sea), civil unrest, bureaucratic impediments,  and physical obstruction. The humanitarian  space in the northern governorates will  continue to be extremely restricted, thereby  hampering the provision of the necessary  supplies and services to the most vulnerable  population. It will also hamper the capacity  of humanitarian actors to monitor closely  the situation on the ground and to intervene  promptly to provide relief.  Civil unrest: Civil unrest will likely continue  to worsen, including due to intense and  widespread conflict, largely insufficient  basic service provision and humanitarian  assistance delivery. This will increasingly  inhibit the transport, distribution, and  utilization of humanitarian assistance within  the Gaza Strip. Displacement: Displacement will likely  remain frequent and localized and conditions  in shelters will continue to deteriorate,  including extreme deprivation of basic needs. food commodities at excessively high prices. As a result, communities’ coping capacity and social cohesion will be further  strained. Social tensions are also likely to increase putting the most vulnerable at higher risk of exposure to violence and  lower access to food. Physical access to markets is also of concern, due to restrictions of civilian mobility and conflict  intensity. Utilization of food resources will also be heavily impacted as seasonal higher temperatures reduce food storage  options in a context of no or extremely limited access to electricity, fuel and/or gas to preserve, process or cook food.  The lack of access to sufficient and safe water, sanitation facilities and health services is likely to increase the risk of cholera  and the spread of infectious diseases impacting people’s nutrition and health status and increasing mortality from non- trauma related causes. The restoration of public services will be a major challenge given that the majority of WASH  facilities and infrastructure are damaged or destroyed. <br>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF30 FRC analysis of acute malnutrition trends A detailed analysis of the drivers (risk factors) for acute malnutrition and the available data on nutritional status was provided by  the Global Nutrition Cluster report on Nutrition Vulnerability in February 2024.7 Based on this report and their own analysis the  IPC Analysis Team concluded that the key driver of acute malnutrition in the North Gaza governorate was the highly inadequate  dietary diversity in Children 6–23m, with 79% consuming ≤2 food groups, 8 and also in Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women,  with 95% consuming ≤2 food groups. The main food groups mentioned were non-vitamin A rich vegetables (24 affirmations),  grains (20) and eggs (17). This situation highlights critically insufficient diet diversity and micronutrient intake before and during  pregnancy and breastfeeding, which can affect both the women and the development of their infants. Infant and Young Chil - dren Feeding practices are highly constrained by the lack of resources and health seeking behavior is also highly constrained.  Interviews conducted by the FRC with key informants and a review of available reports confirmed that the situation in the  northern governates during the current analysis period was similar to that reported by the Analysis Team. The health and WASH  situations are also considered separately belo w. Figure 23: Trends in GAM by MUAC Prevalence in North Gaza (children aged 6-59 mo.) Within the IPC unit of analysis, MUAC screening data9 was available from the North Governorate but not from Gaza City. The  available data was collected as part of a vaccination programme and measurements were only taken from children aged 6-23  months. The FRC explored different methods for using this data to estimate the prevalence of GAM by MUAC in children aged  6-59 months. This was a necessary step to allow the classification of malnutrition according to IPC Phases. To provide a starting point for the trend analysis the prevalence of GAM by MUAC in North Gaza in 2023, before October 7th,  was estimated at 1%. This is consistent with previous studies.11 Age-adjustment of the MUAC screening data resulted in a GAM  by MUAC prevalence in January 2024 of 6.8% to 9.1%. By February this had risen to give a range of 12.4% to 16.5%, indicating a  very steep increase in the incidence of acute malnutrition in children 6-59 mo. To estimate what the prevalence would be at the  time of the current analysis in March 2024, two nowcasting scenarios were examined.  Given the extremely poor situation regarding the drivers of malnutrition, the best-case scenario was that there had been a  continued linear increase in prevalence, while the more likely scenario was that the rate of increase would have followed the  observed trend and have increased further in the time since the February screening. These two scenarios were then applied to  the high and low estimates for age-adjusted GAM by MUAC prevalence, resulting in the four dotted lines shown in Figure 2. This  analysis indicates that in all scenarios the GAM by MUAC prevalence had passed the IPC Phase 4/5 threshold (Critical/Extremely  Critical) in the current analysis period. Given the current trajectory in MUAC prevalence data it is clear that the Famine threshold  for acute malnutrition prevalence, measured using weight-for-height Z-scores, may have already been crossed or will be crossed  imminently. These data were collected exclusively in North Gaza governorate.Healthcare availability and access will likely continue to decline, including due to lack of humanitarian access and  inadequate delivery of critical supplies, as well as a decline in the functionality of the few remaining health centres. The risk  of infectious diseases will likely continue to increase due to the extreme deterioration of the overall health environment.  In line with the Famine Review Committee findings, people’s livelihoods and food consumption are likely to continue  deteriorating, resulting in more than two thirds of the population (70 percent) in IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe). Acute Malnutrition will increase at a high pace as already observed in the past few weeks (current period) and  mortality levels will likely breach the Famine thresholds (extremely critical) - by the end of May 2024.<br>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF31 Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis Governorates These Governorates are projected to remain in IPC Phase 4  (Emergency), though with half of the population (300,000  people) in IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe), up from 30 percent in the  current period; and the other half (300,000 people) in IPC Phase 4  (Emergency). While this unit of analysis includes both Governorates,  the conditions for the population in Khan Younis Governorate are  expected to be worse than those in Deir al-Balah.  The onset of a major ground operation in Rafah Governorate will  likely be a major driver of deterioration in Khan Younis and Deir  al-Balah Governorates, including through an influx of displaced  populations – many already displaced multiple times – into parts  of these Governorates and the impact of the ground operation  on humanitarian access. Ground operations are likely to continue  throughout Khan Younis Governorate and in eastern Deir al-Balah  Governorate.  Displacement will likely escalate with large populations moving into  the Al-Mawasi area of Khan Younis Governorate and into Deir al- Balah Governorate, especially in and around Deir al-Balah city and  camp. Further displacement will likely stress already highly limited  resources and basic services, exacerbating existing conditions. Shelter  conditions are likely to deteriorate with continued deprivation of  basic needs.  Food availability and access are expected to further decline as the  major ground operation in Rafah Governorate reduces humanitarian  and commercial traffic into and throughout the Gaza Strip. This will  be exacerbated by continued civil unrest outside the Kerem Shalom  crossing, which will likely further reduce humanitarian and commercial  truck entry. Fewer humanitarian convoys to these governorates are  expected, including those unsuccessfully attempting to reach the  northern governorates and offloading assistance in Deir al-Balah  instead.  The already limited agricultural production, mostly of vegetables,  observed in the current period will likely continue to decline as  ground operations are pursued within and near production areas of  both governorates, especially in all areas of Khan Younis Governorate;  and the harvest period for several vegetables comes to an end.  Market functionality is likely to continue falling as agricultural  production and humanitarian and commercial truck arrivals decline.  Civilian mobility is likely to be severely constrained, further reducing  access to food, including through coping strategies like gathering  wild foods or scavenging. The end of the typical rainy period may also  limit wild food availability. Compared to other governorates, Deir al-Balah Governorate had  higher food availability in the current period, including due to higher  deliveries of humanitarian food assistance (proportional to estimated Assumptions for the most likely  scenario in Deir al Balah and Khan  Younis Governorates Conflict:  Conflict and related casualties will  likely continue at similar levels to February  2024, including ground operations in mul - tiple but not all urban areas of Deir al-Balah  and throughout Khan Younis governorate,  frequent armed actor clashes especially in  Khan Younis governorate, and a compa - rable rate of bombardment (air, land, sea).  The wider besiegement of the Gaza Strip  will likely continue. Humanitarian access: Humanitarian  access to Khan Younis and Deir al Balah  governorate - including for the delivery  of life-saving multi-sector assistance to  the most vulnerable populations - is likely  to be intermittently reduced, especially  relative to the higher proportional  delivery of assistance made to Deir al- Balah Governorate compared to other  governorates in early 2024. This decrease  in access is likely due to the onset of major  ground operations in Rafah Governorate,  continued ground operations in Khan  Younis governorate, bombardment (air,  land, sea) in these governorates and within  Deir al-Balah Governorate, and worsening  civil unrest.  Civil unrest: Civil unrest will likely escalate,  driven by intense and widespread conflict  as well as largely insufficient basic service  provision and humanitarian assistance  delivery. This will likely increasingly inhibit  the transport, distribution, and utilization  of humanitarian assistance throughout the  Gaza Strip.  Displacement: Displacement will likely  escalate, with large populations moving  into the Al-Mawasi area of Khan Younis  governorate and into Deir al Balah  governorate, especially the area of Deir al  Balah city/camp. Shelter conditions will  likely continue to deteriorate, including  extreme deprivation of basic needs,  extreme overcrowding, and increased  sheltering in open spaces. population) in parts of January and February 2024. These deliveries appear to have partially resulted from the offloading  of humanitarian food assistance that could not be delivered to the northern governorates. Any accumulated stocks in  markets and households will provide at least a short-term buffer to some of the people in the early part of the projection  period. Khan Younis Governorate received lower levels of humanitarian food assistance during that period, resulting in  households likely to face larger food consumption gaps from the beginning of the projection period. With no major  improvements in the availability of electricity, fuel, cooking gas, and safe water, food utilization will likely be a major  limiting factor in Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah Governorates. This includes challenges to the safe storage and preparation <br>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF32 Assumptions for the most likely scenario  in Rafah Governorate Conflict:  Conflict will likely escalate, in - cluding the continuation of the wider  besiegement, the onset of a new, major  ground operation throughout Rafah gov - ernorate and concentrated on Rafah city,  with armed actor clashes, and an increase  in bombardment (air, land, sea). Humanitarian access: Humanitarian  access to Rafah Governorate, including  for the delivery of life-saving multi- sector assistance to the most vulnerable  populations and data collection, will  likely be intermittently reduced, though  without total access loss to the Rafah  Governorate portion of the Al-Mawasi  area, where an extreme concentration of  displaced people is likely. Loss of access  will be particularly high to populations  remaining within Rafah city during the  major ground operation likely to occur  there. This disruption will likely result from  the onset of major ground operations in  Rafah Governorate, continued ground  operations in Khan Younis Governorate,  intensified bombardment (air, land, sea),  and civil unrest.  Civil unrest: Civil unrest will likely continue,  including due to intense and widespread  conflict and severely insufficient basic  service provision and humanitarian  assistance delivery. This will continue to  inhibit the transport, distribution, and  utilization of humanitarian assistance  within the Gaza Strip. Displacement: Displacement will likely  increase substantially, with most of the  current population of Rafah city forced  into the Al-Mawasi area of Rafah and Khan  Younis Governorates and into Deir al-Balah  Governorate, especially the area of Deir al- Balah city/camp. Conditions in shelters will  likely continue to deteriorate, including  extreme deprivation of basic needs,  extreme overcrowding, and increased  sheltering in open spaces.of food, lack of safe access to water, and an increasing incidence of infectious diseases, including diarrhoea, among the  general population. Full resumption of cross border water pipeline activity is unlikely, and the functionality of remaining wells and water  distribution systems will likely decline. Wastewater treatment plants are likely to remain non-functioning. Solid waste  management will continue to be limited. Healthcare availability and access will likely continue to decline, including  due to lack of humanitarian access and inadequate delivery of critical supplies as well as a decline in the functionality of  remaining health centres. Infectious disease risk will continue to increase due to the extreme deterioration of the overall  health environment. Low and declining food availability, access, and utilization will likely  lead to extreme gaps in food consumption and a collapse of coping  capacities for the estimated 300,000 people (50 percent of the  population) experiencing IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe); while  large food  consumptions gaps are expected for the 300,00 people (50 percent of  the population) in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency).  With the drivers of acute  malnutrition expected to worsen (infectious diseases expected to  increase, dietary diversity still severely restricted), the nutritional status  of the people of Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis will likely continue  to deteriorate towards critical levels of acute malnutrition (IPC AMN  Phase 4) during this period.  Rafah Governorate The onset of a major ground operation in Rafah Governorate will  likely drive a significant increase in acute food insecurity alongside  other severe humanitarian consequences. The situation is projected  to remain in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency), though with nearly half (45  percent) of the population (around 600,000 people) in IPC Phase 5  (Catastrophe), up from 25 percent in the current period. The whole  population of Rafah will likely be in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis) or above,  including over one third (about 464,000 people) in IPC Phase 4  (Emergency) and 12 percent (about 265,000 people) in IPC Phase  3 (Crisis). Relative improvement in access into and within Rafah have been  observed compared to the previous analysis, with the opening of a  second border crossing in Kerem Shalom allowing more humanitarian  and commercial supply for aid and markets, However, for the projection  period, considering the most likely scenario of a major ground operation  in Rafah, the humanitarian access and space are likely to reduce due  to the escalating hostilities and populations will face continued and  repeated displacement in search of “safer” areas. As many IDPs already  face poor food security, nutrition, health and WASH outcomes, further  displacement will likely cause further deterioration. Existing mitigation  measures from humanitarian services or programmes are likely to be  disrupted by conflict or sizeable displacements and may cause further  family separation or marginalization of the most vulnerable. Local production will be minimal and difficult to access and agricultural  activities (crop production, livestock herding or fishing) will either not  be pursued or remain very limited due to lack of agricultural inputs,  access to assets or land and geographical concentration of displaced  populations. Further disruptions to market supplies and prices are likely  to continue and decrease access to food through markets. Markets or  traders may be displaced along with the population, impacting their  ability to restock or remain functional, especially as populations move  further away from border crossings and fewer trucks enter the Gaza <br>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF33 Strip. Market-based interventions will continue to be challenged by high levels of displacement, including of the staff of  financial service providers, and a wider loss of enabling condition, including an adequate electricity supply and functional  telecommunications services, physical cash availability and access, and functioning markets able to absorb any rapid  increases in demand. Physical access to humanitarian assistance and markets will be hindered. There will likely be a disruption in social support  systems (e.g. community kitchens) and increased tensions within the community. Rising temperatures and declining access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene will likely lead to challenges in safe food  storage and preparation, and a rise in waterborne diseases or food borne illnesses. Scarcity of firewood will force people  to resort to using unsafe materials, increasing health risks. Explosive remnants will raise concerns about personal, food  and water safety.  Health outcomes and morbidity are expected to deteriorate in this period and even more so with increased overcrowding,  further displacement and/or lower access to health services. A major decrease in food availability, access, and utilization will likely cause extreme gaps in food consumption and  the exhaustion of people’s coping strategies. Acute malnutrition is likely to increase towards IPC AMN Phase 3 (Serious)  as food insecurity, the health environment, and infant and young childcare and feeding practices deteriorate due  to conflict escalation, displacement, and reduced delivery of, and access to multi-sector humanitarian assistance.<br>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF34 COMPARISON WITH THE PREVIOUS ANALYSIS In comparison to the previous analysis (projection period December 2023 – 7 February 2024), the total share of the  population in IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe) across the Gaza Strip continues to increase, from 26 percent to 30 percent in  the current period (mid-February to mid-March 2024) and 50% in the projection period (mid-March to mid-July). In the  northern governorates, the share of the population in IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe) increased from 30 percent to 55 percent  in the current period and 70% in the projected period, representing an increase of about 100,000 people and 530,000  people, respectively.

HHS trends in the Gaza Strip<br>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF36 RISK OF FAMINE ANALYSIS As per the IPC tools and technical guidance, an IPC statement on the risk of Famine differs from a Famine classification.  While a projected Famine classification is based on the most likely scenario, the risk of Famine refers to the worst case  scenario that has a reasonable and realistic chance of happening. The risk of Famine is only a statement and not a  classification and was designed to complement the standard IPC projections of the most likely scenario by providing  insights of a potential Famine if prospects evolve in a manner worse than anticipated. The elements considered when developing the worst case scenario are described below.  Factor/element Risk of Famine Scenario - Deir al-Balah and  Khan Younis GovernoratesRisk of Famine Scenario – Rafah Governorate Primary Drivers ConflictConflict would escalate to levels seen in  December 2023-January 2024 when a major  ground operation was conducted in Bureij and  Maghazi camps of Deir al-Balah Governorate.  This would include expanding and intensified  ground operations across all central camps  alongside neighbourhood-level clearing  operations throughout Khan Younis Governorate,  frequent armed actor clashes, and increased  bombardment (air, land, sea).. Expanded ground  operations within Deir al-Balah Governorate  would not necessarily be concurrent with a  major ground operation on Rafah. The wider  besiegement of the Gaza Strip would intensify.Conflict would rapidly escalate, including  the onset of a new, wide-ranging, and large- scale ground operation throughout Rafah  Governorate and concentrated on Rafah city,  intense and frequent armed actor clashes, and  a large increase in bombardment (air, land, sea).  The wider besiegement of the Gaza Strip would  intensify. Humanitarian  AccessHumanitarian access, including for the delivery  of life-saving multi-sector assistance to the most  vulnerable populations and data collection,  to Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah Governorate  would severely reduce, including due to the  onset of major ground operations in Rafah  Governorate, continued ground operations in  Khan Younis Governorate, the later resumption  of major ground operations in Deir al-Balah  Governorate, intensified bombardment (air, land,  sea), the closure of the Rafah border crossing  and reduction in crossings at Kerem Shalom, and  public order collapse.Humanitarian access to Rafah Governorate,  including for the delivery of life-saving multi- sector assistance to the most vulnerable  populations and data collection, would severely  reduce. Access to populations remaining within  Rafah city during the major ground operation  would be completely lost, while access to the  extreme concentration of displaced people  in the Rafah portion of the Al-Mawasi area  would be intermittent. This disruption would  result from the onset of major, rapid ground  operations in Rafah Governorate, continued  ground operations in Khan Younis Governorate,  intensified bombardment (air, land, sea), the  closure of the Rafah border crossing and  reduction in crossings at Kerem Shalom, and  public order collapse. <br>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF37 Factor/element Risk of Famine Scenario - Deir al-Balah and  Khan Younis GovernoratesRisk of Famine Scenario – Rafah Governorate Secondary Drivers Civil unrestAlready strained, public order would collapse,  involving widespread and intense civil unrest,  including looting, riots, vigilantism, escalating  violence among various social groups, and a  wider breakdown of social cohesion. This collapse  would heavily constrain humanitarian operations  through reducing access and inhibiting the ability  to conduct critical activities like distributions,  especially to the most vulnerable population  groups. The United Nations presence within the  Gaza Strip, including offices and storage facilities,  would be particularly impacted, including by  violence and looting. The loss of social cohesion  would involve the loss of most remaining socially- based coping, such as receiving food or cash  through social networks outside of immediate  family.Already strained, public order would collapse,  involving widespread and intense civil unrest,  including looting, riots, vigilantism, escalating  violence among various social groups, and  a wider breakdown of social cohesion.

Given the continued catastrophic food security situation across the entire Gaza Strip, a risk of Famine analysis was done for  Deir al Balah, Khan Younis, and Rafah Governorates. This analysis considered whether Famine will occur under a reasonable  worst-case scenario during the projection period through 15 July 2024. An analysis for the northern governorates was not  performed as the FRC is projecting Famine in those areas under the most likely scenario. The FRC considered the assumptions for the worst-case scenario made by the Analysis Team regarding the evolution of the  conflict and the expected impacts on food security and acute malnutrition to be plausible for all three governorates.  The intensity of the conflict and the extent of humanitarian space will determine the magnitude and directions of population  movement within the Gaza Strip. It is currently impossible to ascertain the destination(s) of these human-made displacements,  however any further concentration of population in any already highly populated area, for instance as a consequence of  an escalation in the Rafah Governorate driving hundreds of thousands towards Al-Mawasi and the surrounding areas, will  significantly increase the risk of Famine. The FRC considered the risk of Famine statement made by the Analysis Team about Deir al-Balah, Khan Younis and Rafah  Governorates to be plausible. Given the high degree of uncertainty and fluidity of the situation with displacements likely  forcing people to move to and from multiple localities, the FRC felt it was appropriate to group together all three of the  southern governates for a risk of Famine analysis rather than to separate the governates as different units of analysis.    Forced  displacement will increase the risk of Famine because of overcrowding, poor supply of food, water, and medicines, and limited  provision of health and wash services, which will expose the displaced population to epidemic outbreaks.  The FRC reached technical consensus that, under a reasonable worst-case scenario, there is a risk of Famine across the entire  middle and southern areas of the Gaza Strip during the projection period of mid-March to mid-July 2024. The cessation of  hostilities together with the restoration of humanitarian space to deliver multi-sectoral assistance and restore services are  essential steps in mitigating the risk of Famine.<br>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF40 CONCLUSIONS OF THE FAMINE REVIEW COMMITTEE (FRC)  This report is the second time that the Famine Review Committee has reviewed analysis conducted by a multi-agency,  multi-sectoral Analysis Team to determine the current and projected food security situation in the Gaza Strip. The first  analysis, conducted in December 2023, determined that there was a risk of Famine within the projection period of  December 2023 to May 2024, and that the risk would increase for each day that the intense conflict and restricted  humanitarian access persisted or worsened.  The findings of the FRC’s latest review confirm that Famine is now projected and imminent in the North Gaza and Gaza  Governorates  and is expected to become manifest between mid-March 2024 and May 2024. The Famine threshold for  acute food insecurity has already been far exceeded and the steeply increasing trend in malnutrition data indicates that  it is highly likely that the Famine threshold for acute malnutrition has also been exceeded. The FRC expects the upward  trend in non-trauma mortality to accelerate and for all Famine thresholds to be passed imminently.  It is vital to note that the projected Famine can be prevented or alleviated. All evidence points towards a major  acceleration of deaths and malnutrition. Waiting for a retrospective Famine classification before acting is indefensible.  The FRC concludes that Famine is imminent unless there is an immediate cessation of hostilities and full access is granted  to provide food, water, medicines, and protection of civilians as well as to restore and provide health, water, and sanitation  services, and energy (electricity, diesel, and other fuel) to the population in the northern governorates.  In the current period  (leading up to mid-March), the FRC finds the conclusions of the IPC Analysis Team for the northern  governorates to be plausible (IPC Phase 4 Emergency). However, the FRC highlighted that: (i) Famine thresholds for acute  food insecurity have already been surpassed; (ii) Famine thresholds for acute malnutrition (Extremely Critical) have likely  already been surpassed; (iii) It is likely that these extreme levels of malnutrition have not yet translated into a Crude  Death Rate above 2/10,000/day. The likelihood of having surpassed Under-Five Death Rate thresholds (4/10,000/day for  children) is higher but impossible to ascertain.  For the Governorates of Deir al-Balah, Khan Younis, and Rafah , the FRC considers the findings of the Analysis Team  for the current period (IPC Phase 4 – Emergency) to be plausible. The projection period identified by the Analysis Team  is mid-March 2024 to mid-July 2024. The FRC considers the most likely scenarios and conclusions of the Analysis Team  for the projected period (IPC Phase 4 – Emergency) to be plausible. However, given the high uncertainty over how the  situation will evolve and a high degree of fluidity given the intensity of the conflict, forced displacements, and constricted  humanitarian access in the next 4 months, the FRC recommends grouping all southern governates together for a risk of  Famine analysis . Thus, for the combined southern and middle governates, the FRC concludes that there is a risk of  Famine during the projection period of mid-March to mid-July  in a worst-case scenario with a reasonable chance of  occurring.  The primary drivers of the food security, nutrition, and mortality situation in Gaza Strip are the conflict intensity and highly  constrained/restricted access, defined as the ability of humanitarian and private actors to deliver the necessary supplies  and services to the most vulnerable population. Only an immediate and sustainable cessation of hostility, accompanied  by a sustained supply of food, water, medicines, protection services, and provision of health and sanitation services  to the population can reduce acute malnutrition and excess mortality. Provision of electricity/fuel supplies for water  trucking, pumps, health services, restoration of agricultural production, and other essential needs are also critical, along  with support for unrestricted civilian communications within and outside of the Gaza Strip. The actions needed to prevent Famine require an immediate political decision for a ceasefire together with a significant  and immediate increase in humanitarian and commercial access to the entire population of Gaza. If this does not happen  fully and immediately, even if Famine is avoided in the near term, the impact on mortality and the lives of Palestinians  now, and in future generations, will increase markedly with every day.<br>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF41 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ACTION Famine can be halted. The rapidly escalating hunger crisis in the Gaza Strip must immediately be curbed. This requires  putting an end to the hostilities, mobilizing necessary resources and ensuring the safe delivery of humanitarian assistance  to the people of Gaza.  Response Priorities  Overall recommendations • Restore humanitarian access to the entire Gaza Strip. • Stop the fast-paced deterioration of the food security, health and nutrition situation leading to excess mortality  through:  (i) the restoration of health, nutrition, and WASH services and the protection of civilians; and (ii) the provision of safe, nutritious, and sufficient food to all the population in need.  • The sustained supply of sufficient aid commodities, including but not limited to food, medicines, specialist nutrition  products, fuel, and other necessities should be allowed to enter and move throughout the entire Gaza Strip by road.  Traffic of commercial goods should also be fully resumed to meet the volume of commodities required.  Programmatic recommendations • Deliver acute malnutrition treatment services, specifically CMAM and IYCF-E services throughout the Gaza Strip, with  a particular emphasis on opening stabilization centres in the north. • Supply ready-to-use formula for non-breastfed infants and ensure sufficient access to safe drinking water if preparation  is required.  • Provide complimentary foods and micronutrient supplements for young children, as well as pregnant and lactating  women, the chronically ill, and the elderly. • Restore the functioning of market infrastructures and bakeries combined with cash-based interventions where  feasible. • Rehabilitate food production systems as soon as possible, including horticulture, livestock, and fishing. Situation Monitoring and Update  Considering the volatility of the context and the changing environment, the following risk factor elements should be  monitored continuously: • Intensity and extension of hostilities • Humanitarian access to supply food, water medicines, non-food items • Functionality and access to the health system and WASH supplies and services  • Entry of commodities though the Gaza Strip whether through commercial trucks or food assistance by truck or  airdrops • Population displacements and conditions in collective centres and scattered sites • Morbidity and disease outbreaks  • Acute malnutrition and mortality, with a distinction of the trauma and non-trauma causes <br>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF42 PROCESS AND METHODOLOGY Similar to the previous analysis conducted in December 2023, the IPC Global Partnership completed an IPC analysis for  the Gaza Strip to inform critical humanitarian information needs. Country led IPC analyses are the cornerstone of the  IPC process and will continue to be so. In the case of the Gaza Strip, with the onset of the conflict and the subsequent  humanitarian catastrophe, there was a critical need for an IPC analysis. Without an active country Technical Working  Group, the IPC Global Partnership made use of its non-TWG led analysis process to inform decision-making around the  crisis in the Gaza Strip.  The analysis was conducted remotely from 26 February to 1 March by over 40 experts from 18 agencies, applying standard  IPC protocols, and made use of publicly available data from a wide range of courses on the conditions in the Gaza Strip  (see below). Based on IPC protocols, the level of evidence of this analysis was assessed as “Medium” (level 2) for each of  the three units of analysis. At the analysis completion, the Famine Review Committee was activated to review the Analysis  Team’s findings. Their conclusions were adopted by the Analysis Team.

The IPC is a set of tools and procedures to  classify the severity and characteristics of  acute food and nutrition crises as well as  chronic food insecurity based on interna - tional standards. The IPC consists of four mu - tually reinforcing functions, each with a set  of specific protocols (tools and procedures).  The core IPC parameters include consen - sus building, convergence of evidence,  accountability, transparency and compa - rability. The IPC analysis aims at informing  emergency response as well as medium  and long-term food security policy and pro - gramming. For the IPC, acute food insecurity is defined  as any manifestation of food insecurity  found in a specified area at a specific point  in time of a severity that threatens lives or  livelihoods, or both, regardless of the causes,  context or duration. It is highly susceptible  to change and can occur and manifest in a  population within a short amount of time,  as a result of sudden changes or shocks that  negatively impact on the determinants of  food insecurity. Contact for further Information IPC Global Support Unit   www.ipcinfo.org IPC Special Briefs are produced by the IPC  global initiative and do not necessarily  reflect the views of stakeholders in the  Gaza Strip. Classification of food insecurity and  malnutrition was conducted using the  IPC protocols, which are developed and  implemented worldwide by the IPC Global  Partnership - Action Contre la Faim, CARE,  CILSS, EC-JRC, FAO, FEWS NET, Global Food  Security Cluster, Global Nutrition Cluster,  IFPRI, IGAD, Oxfam, SICA, SADC, Save the  Children, UNDP , UNICEF, WFP , WHO and the  World Bank. Phase 1 None/Minimal Households are able  to meet essential  food and non-food  needs without  engaging in atypical  and unsustainable  strategies to access  food and income.Phase 2 Stressed Households have  minimally adequate  food consumption  but are unable  to afford some  essential non-food  expenditures without  engaging in stress- coping strategies.Phase 3 Crisis Households either: • have food  consumption gaps  that are reflected by  high or above-usual  acute malnutrition; or • are marginally able  to meet minimum  food needs but  only by depleting  essential livelihood  assets or through  crisis-coping  strategies.Phase 4 Emergency Households either: • have large food  consumption gaps  that are reflected  in very high acute  malnutrition and  excess mortality; or • are able to  mitigate large  food consumption  gaps but only  by employing  emergency  livelihood strategies  and asset liquidationPhase 5 Catastrophe/  Famine Households  experience an  extreme lack of  food and/or cannot  meet other basic  needs even after  full employment of  coping strategies.  Starvation, death,  destitution and  extremely critical  acute malnutrition  levels are evident.  For Famine Classi  cation, area needs  to have extremely  critical levels of acute  malnutrition and  mortality.Acute Food Insecurity Phase name and descriptionLimitations of the Analysis  Given the major access constraints, data on food security outcomes  was collected using Computer Assisted Telephone Interviews (CATI).  Quality concerns regarding the use of this methodology including the  representativeness, and potential biases associated with mobile network  coverage and ownership were discussed at length during the previous round  of IPC analysis (for data collected in November 2023). The Analysis Team  concluded that the data meets the requirements set by the IPC and were  the same for this analysis, especially considering the number of observations.  Through the efforts of partners, gaps in nutrition information were filled  through screening information. The high degree of volatility around the  conflict limits the ability to consider longer analysis periods. Scenarios on the  evolution of the conflict were developed in conjunction with conflict experts  to the best of their knowledge and expertise. <br>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF44 ENDNOTES 1 PCBS Labour Force Survey, 2022 -

This limited response was attributed to frequent telecommunication disruptions in the Gaza Strip during  the mentioned period. The primary focus was on Rafah, where 6 shops participated in the WFP survey on January 21,  and one in Khan Younis. 35  Ibid.  36  Ibid.  37  Food Security Sector (Palestine), Sector Update #13 , 19 January 2024, https://fscluster.org/state-of-palestine/ document/fss-gaza-updates   38  Gaza Cash Working Group, Meeting Minutes , 6 February 2024, Meeting Minutes - URL 39  OCHA, Hostilities in the Gaza Strip and Israel - reported impact , 19 February 2024 at 15:00, https://reliefweb.int/report/ occupied-palestinian-territory/hostilities-gaza-strip-and-israel-reported-impact-19-february-2024-1500 40  OCHA, Humanitarian Access Snapshot - Gaza Strip  | End-February 2024, 6 March 2024, https://www. ochaopt.org/content/humanitarian-access-snapshot-gaza-strip-end-february-2024?_gl=1*tdp1i0*_ ga*MTEwNjk4NDg0LjE3MDk3NDIwNzg.*_ga_E60ZNX2F68*MTcwOTgwMDIxOC4yLjEuMTcwOTgwMTI3OS41NS4wLjA 41  UNRWA, Gaza Supply and Dispatch Tracking, March 2024. 42  WFP , UN Food Agency pauses deliveries to the North of Gaza , 20 February 2024,  https://www.wfp.org/news/un-food- agency-pauses-deliveries-north-gaza 43  WFP , WFP food deliveries to northern Gaza face further setbacks,  5 March 2024, https://www.wfp.org/news/wfp-food- deliveries-northern-gaza-face-further-setbacks 44  OCHA, Hostilities in the Gaza Strip and Israel | Flash Update #136 , 11 March 2024, https://www.ochaopt.org/content/ hostilities-gaza-strip-and-israel-flash-update-136  <br>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF46 45  Gaza Cash Working Group, Emergency MPCA – Gaza 2023, Joint PDM results overview , 15 February 2024, https://drive. google.com/drive/folders/17wI2GlSITludiA126Bry6L37E4aO0Plx 46  Ibid. 47  Gaza Cash Working Group, Meeting Minutes , 13 February 2024, Meeting Minutes - URL 48  FAO, European Union and CIRAD, Food Systems Profile - Palestine,  2023, https://doi.org/10.4060/cc7323en 49  ECHO, Humanitarian Implementation Plan (HIP) Palestine, 19 December 2023, https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied- palestinian-territory/humanitarian-implementation-plan-hip-palestine-echopsebud202491000-version-1   50  OCHA, Hostilities in the Gaza Strip and Israel | Flash Update #71 , 16 December 2023, https://www.ochaopt.org/content/ hostilities-gaza-strip-and-israel-flash-update-71 51  OCHA,  Hostilities in the Gaza Strip and Israel | Flash Update #71 , 16 December 2023, https://www.ochaopt.org/content/ hostilities-gaza-strip-and-israel-flash-update-71 ; OCHA, Hostilities in the Gaza Strip and Israel | Flash Update #99, 22  January 2024, https://www.ochaopt.org/content/hostilities-gaza-strip-and-israel-flash-update-99  52  UNRWA, Gaza Supply and Dispatch Tracking, March 2024. 53  OCHA, Humanitarian Access Snapshot - Gaza Strip | End-January 2024 , 5 February 2024, https://www.unocha.org/ publications/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/humanitarian-access-snapshot-gaza-strip-end-january-2024 54  OCHA, Hostilities in the Gaza Strip and Israel | Flash Update #54 , November 2023, https://www.unocha.org/publications/ report/occupied-palestinian-territory/hostilities-gaza-strip-and-israel-flash-update-54 55  UNRWA, Gaza Supply and Dispatch Tracking, March 2024. 56  WFP , mVAM Survey, 19 February 2024. 57  In the November - December mVAM survey of WFP , the sampling design was not designed to be representative at  governorate-level for Rafah, nor for any other single governorate.
