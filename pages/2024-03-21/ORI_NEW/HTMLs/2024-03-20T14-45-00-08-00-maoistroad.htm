  Workers of a yarn factory AA Yarn Limited
  <a href="https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/nation/341368/workers-block-highway-to-implement-new-salary">
   clashed
  </a>
  with the police on the 9
  <sup>
   th
  </sup>
  of March in Sreepur, Gazipur district of Bangladesh, demanding higher 
wages. The workers blocked the Dhaka-Mymensingh highway, denouncing that
 the factory bosses had ignored the demands of the workers for better 
pay despite multiple efforts from the workers to negotiate. The police 
repressed the workers with tear gas, rubber bullets and stun grenades, 
and the workers as a response defended the protest by throwing bricks at
 the police. It is reported that there was some injured among the 
workers as well as passers-by due to the police brutality.
 </p>
 <p>
  The yarn workers of the factory earn around 6,000 Tk (around 55 US 
Dollars) a month, and the protesters denounced that they are not able to
 live with this wage and that the wages had not been raised even to the 
new minimum set in November. In November, there were
  <a href="https://redherald.org/2023/11/14/bangladesh-thousands-of-workers-struggle-against-bureaucratic-capitalism/">
   large protests
  </a>
  of garment workers, who demanded that the minimum wage of the garment 
workers are raised from 8,000 Tk to 23,000 Tk. The government refused to
 raise the wage to the demanded level, and set 12,500 Tk (114 US 
Dollars) as the new monthly minimum wage. In November, these protests 
were also met with severe repression and police brutality, with hundreds
 arrested and at least two workers murdered by the police shooting at 
the protesters with live ammunition.

 <p>
  On the 11
  <sup>
   th
  </sup>
  of March workers of Sterling Styles Ltd
  <a href="https://www.tbsnews.net/economy/rmg/6-garment-workers-injured-during-protest-ashulias-sterling-styles-factory-807370">
   protested
  </a>
  in Jamgora, Ashulia, demanding overtime pay and paid holidays among 
other things. The factory boss said the factory operates according to 
the labor laws of Bangladesh and commented that “For the last three days
 our workers have been agitated with unreasonable demands, including 
payment of 11 days of annual leave as well as day-offs on every public 
holiday.” He said that they already give days off during Ramadan and 
that it is unreasonable to demand get paid also for these days. 
According to the boss, the workers had attacked six low level bosses and
 injured them. The workers had also thrown bricks at the police, who 
repressed the protest with tear gas. According to the media, a 
representative of the trade union Garments Sramik Oikya League said that
 the demands of the workers have “no legal justification” and that the 
union would not get involved.
 </p>
 <p>
  These statements calling the demands unreasonable reflect on the 
conditions of the garment workers in Bangladesh, which is a 
semi-colonial and semi-feudal country with a large garments industry and
 where many clothes for imperialist monopolies, such as H&amp;M, Zara, 
Lidl and Primark are produced. We wrote in November: “This struggle of 
the Bangladeshi proletariat against garment monopolies of the 
bureaucratic capital is part of the struggle of the people against 
semi-feudality and semi-colonialism and the 
bureaucratic-big-landlord-dictatorship. Its not just a struggle for an 
increasing of the wage, but it is for national liberation, against the 
oppression and subjugation of the country to the imperialists…” These 
local clashes show that the situation continues as prone to explosion.
