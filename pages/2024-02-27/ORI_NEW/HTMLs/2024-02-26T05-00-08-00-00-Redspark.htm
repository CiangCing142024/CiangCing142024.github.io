   Kathmandu, February 26, 2024:
  </strong>
  A meeting of the Socialist Front of Nepal, a coalition of four Communist and Socialist parties, took place today.
 </p>
 <p>
  The meeting earlier scheduled for Sunday was postponed for today.
 </p>
 <p>
  According to the Front’s Secretariat led by coordinator Netra Bikram Chand, the Sunday meeting was rescheduled due to a timing clash with the CPN (Maoist Centre)’s meeting.
 </p>
 <p>
  Adig Bogati, a secretariat member of the Chand led CPN, said that the meeting commenced at 8 AM today.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Socialist Front’s meeting is intended to announce the schedule for interaction programs in the major cities across Nepal’s seven provinces.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Socialist Front consists of the CPN (Maoist Centre), CPN (Unified Socialist), Communist Party of Nepal led by Chand, and the Janata Samajwadi Party.
