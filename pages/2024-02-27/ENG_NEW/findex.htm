<p>
  For the past few days, the reactionary newspapers from the Peru press conquering have reported a new increase in the masses' rejection, condemnation and protest against the reactionary government under the fascist, folk murderous and fatherlands selling Dina Boluarne, her parliament and other institutions and parties with their representatives of The old landlord-bureaucratic state in the service of imperialism, mainly Yankee imperialism.
 </p>
<p>
  The most talked about incident was last month in Ayacucho, where the population expressed their rejection of President Dina Boluart's presence, which was beaten and drawn in the lusts of relatives of those killed in the protests against her government in December 2022 and January 2023. The incident. took place as she threw candy into the crowd like a carnival queen. As an article in a reactionary newspaper has written on the opinion side, the dozens of deaths that her government has caused using the armed forces and police, tied around her neck and pulling her down and will end up lowering her. Now she is doomed not to travel in the country, her advertised intention to visit Ouno these days has been rejected and she is sitting in the government palace and considering: traveling or not to travel is the question.
 </p>
<p>
  Now the Peruvian people who continue their rejection, condemnation and rejection of Dina Boluarte's fascist, folk murderous and homeland -selling government have demonstrated in Puno, as the newspapers have reported:
 </p>
<p>
  »Minister of Culture Leslie Urteaga had an eventful visit to Puno on Sunday,
  <a href="https://www.infobae.com/peru/2024/02/03/ministra-de-cultura-leslie-urteaga-fue-echada-de-evento-publico-en-puno-largate-gobierno-asesino/">
   where a group of citizens jogged her away under insults while she demanded justice for those killed in the protests
  </a>
  against the government. Under the traditional entrada de Kapus, the protesters shouted slogans as "murderous government", "disappear from Puno", "What do you want here?" But she ignored them all the time.
 </p>
<p>
  The portfolio manager stated that despite the signs of rejection from the executive power, she will continue with her visits to other regions. “I think we sometimes ministers are missing time to visit all the places we want. This question of humiliation or verbal aggression is not going to stop us from continuing to work, ”she said.
 </p>
<p>
  The mass's rejection of the government is in full swing. As we have said:
 </p>
<p>
  The crisis at all levels, the reactionary measures to read the burden of the crisis onto the masses, sow wind and must harvest storm. The fiscal adaptation policy with cuts in pensions, rights and benefits, with worsening of employment and wages, with the reduction of 'support' and subsidies, with more and more rot and inefficiencies of the old state from top to toe and the genocide of the masses increase the masses Day by day, and the protest and resistance of the popular masses as their counterpart grows, the masses are more active and in motion. The reaction brings the revolution to life.
 </p>
<p>
  Crisis in ancient society, crisis in the bureaucratic capitalism and crisis of the old landlord-bureaucratic state that defends and maintains it. Crisis in parliament and in all the bourgeois-democratic institutions. Submission of the other powers to the executive power with the support and support of the reactionary armed forces and the bureaucratic state apparatus. The situation has not been significantly changed by the current situation where the existence of the current government depends on the will of parliament, and the existence of the present parliament with its current composition depends on the will of the genocide president. It happens in a fierce battle between the factions of the big citizenship and the struggle and the struggle of the masses and resistance to rights, freedoms and goods, which are the basis of their mobilization, so that the party can raise them for political struggle to fight for power by joining the People's War. This is why it is necessary to complete the general reorganization of the party. Chairman Gonzalo says on the 2nd plenary: To see the new fascism, it is very important to elaborate on the study and the foundation found in "Comments on the coup in 1992" both in compressor citizenship and in the bureaucratic citizenship.
 </p>
<p>
  The fire of the three mountains' exploitation and oppression of the masses of workers, peasants and petty bourgeoisie and the national bourgeoisie, which is facing further ruin. The masses who are struggling to keep what they have won in the hard class struggle, and not to be further impoverished by the new crisis, ups and downs that will repeat themselves cyclically in this ruling system, and as only the invincible People's War will be able to sweep away. The masses 'opposition to the reactionary governments' famous 'economic and work reforms and adaptations' that try to read the serious crisis in this outdated system of exploitation and oppression over the masses, both in the countryside and in the city, this crisis sharpens the contradiction between the popular masses and the reactionary government. It is an expression of the tightening of the contradictions of ancient society: mass-feudalism, folk-bureaucratic capitalism and nation-imperialism, which can only be solved by leading the democratic uprising to the end of people war.

</p>
<p>
  On Tuesday, February 13, President Dina Boluarta is expected to make changes to the staff of the ministerial, which is led by Alberto Otárola. The presidency confirmed that the head of state would take at least five ministers in oath at 1 p.m. 18.00: Álex Contreras (Economics and Finance), Miriam Ponce (Education), Albina Ruíz (Environment), Óscar Vera (Energy and Miner) and Jorge Chávez (Defense).
 </p>
<p>
  It was later revealed that the new finance and finance minister is José Arista. Previously, it was Álex Contreras.
 </p>
<p>
  As the same newspaper reports, the ministerial crisis with some ministers' departure and the redeployment of the cabinet with the new ministers mentioned above is a clear sign of the old state's rot, which is expressed in all its institutions and more open in the executive power , where the ministers go because of big questions, not only about incompetence, but also rottenness and a consequence of secret agreements and struggles within and with the other powers and institutions of the old state.
 </p>
<p>
  Furthermore, this remodeling of Otarola's cabinet is a lifeline to try to maintain the Boluarthe Otarola government, a fascist genocomeric and homeland-selling government in the service of imperialism, mainly Yankee imperialism.
 </p>
<p>
  The new Minister of Finance and Finance was the regional president of the Amazon, a post he had from 2011 to 2014. And like all regional presidents, there are no exceptions, he has the following complaints:
 </p>
<p>
  The new Minister of Economy, José Arista Arbildo, has three complaints with the State Attorney. The replacement for Alex Contreras is accused of negotiating incompatible or drawn undue advantage of his position, extortion by cheating the state of its assets and abuse of authority.
 </p>
<p>
  He has already served as minister under Yankee Kusynki, was Minister of Agriculture in 2018 and by 2020, under the short-term Merino government, he was the leader of the Ministry of Economy and Finance.
 </p>
<p>
  He is a large national and international bureaucrat breastfeeding by Yankee imperialism; He belongs to the high state bureaucracy, the "autopilot" in the old landlord-bureaucratic state in the service of imperialism, which the counter-revolutionary Rondero Castillo Terrone confided in his speech on July 28, 2021, a high state bureaucracy that has been on "pilot" since The beginning of the current regime in 1992 and has earned almost all governments, as José Arista's Curriculum Vitae says:
 </p>
<p>
  "José Arista has a master's degree in economics from the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) and a specialization course at the Catholic University of Chile (project evaluation)."
 </p>
<p>
  José Arista's career in the Peruvian state began in 1990 as national director of the public budget in MEF, in 1992 he supported the establishment of Sunat, and in 1997 he was responsible for the development of the tax administration (SAT). Between 2006 and 2010 he was Deputy Finance Minister.
 </p>
<p>
  Subsequently, José Arista was elected regional president in the Amazon and worked in the period 2011-2014.
 </p>
<p>
  The following year, the Ministry of Education appointed him project director for the preparation and development of the Pan American Games in 2019.
 </p>
<p>
  Between January and April 2018, José Arista was Minister of Agriculture and irrigation under Pedro Pablo Kuczynski's government.
 </p>
<p>
  José Arista has also been director of Banco de la Nación (
  <em>
   Ed. - Danmarks Nationalbank
  </em>
  ), Deputy Governor of the Inter -American Development Bank (IDB,
  <em>
   red. – Inter-American Development Bank

  The imprisoned journalist from the newspaper Yeni Democrasi, Ertan çıta, has become
  <a href="https://www.yenidemokrasi34.net/muhabirimiz-ertan-cita-hakkinda-tahliye-karari.html">
   released
  </a>
  to await the trial. Çıta was arrested on October 3, 2023 for his work to inform the public about the reality that the ruling classes want to keep them unaware of. He was arrested for "membership of a terrorist organization" and to "provide services and funding to the organization", but released to await trial for both charges after being in prison for almost three months.
 </p>
<p>
  Çıta had been exposed to threats and harassment ever since he started working as a journalist in dersim. On October 3, he was detained with Partizan readers in a wave of raids performed by police. In jail
  <a href="https://www.yenidemokrasi34.net/ertan-cita-biz-cemberin-icindeyiz-ya-siz.html">
   he wrote a letter
  </a>
  , where he defended the work of progressive journalists and the right of the population to know the truth:
 </p>
<p>
  »Is it possible to talk about impartial journalism in an environment where the public's right to receive information is reduced day by day, the censorship has reached its utmost, and manipulation and disinformation has become the state's policy?
 </p>
<p>
  We are journalists. We are the most active subjects in the public struggle to learn the facts and see the truth. It is us who are in the field and it is us who see facts in all their nudity, closely. Therefore, there are no problems for those who choose to be "neutral" and those who take the principled attitude that "the snake that does not touch me must live for a thousand years". Those like us who reject impartial journalism and stand with workers, students and oppressed are the target of attacks. (…)
 </p>
<p>
  If any event or action has a page or ideology, it is not possible for us journalists to be impartial. Our side is the struggle for freedom for the working people of the world. Just as the poet said, "You are either within the circle or outside it," there is no other option. We, the free press workers, are right in the middle of the circle and we will continue our fight until this circle is broken. "

<p>
  Pşta's speech continued: "We greet you all with the enthusiasm, determination and determination of our red carnations that rise to the level of immortality, our resistance flowers that bloom in the deep darkness of prisoners."
 </p>
<p>
  In the speech, where the importance of organization was affected, it was emphasized that life has no meaning other than to resist the oppression and exploitation system and organize themselves for this purpose.
 </p>
<p>
  With reference to organizational problems, it was emphasized that the relatives of martyrs and prisoners should organize and protect the values and the revolutionary struggle.
 </p>
<p>
  It was emphasized that many problems arose with the process that started with F-type prisons, and it was said that the relatives of martyrs and prisoners had common problems and interests, just like the workers. With the phrase "neither the suffering is over for the relatives of the martyrs or the responsibility that the children of the martyrs have imposed on them," it was explained that this also applied to the prisoners' relatives.
 </p>
<h5 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>
   »
  </strong>
<strong>
   We should organize ourselves against pressure
  </strong>
<strong>
   «
  </strong>
</h5>
<p>
  While it is emphasized that the prisoners can withstand all kinds of oppression because they are organized, "should their success in being strong, show solidarity, act together, stop and even reduce oppression under difficult and constantly pressed conditions be an example for us. ""
 </p>
<p>
  While it is said that organization has been a burning need from past to present, "during the period we are going through, it is necessary to come forward to respond to this need. We must see that both families and prisoners need studies in this direction. "
 </p>
<p>
  It was emphasized that all that we see around us is the reality that the martyrs and those who were taken prisoner so and rebelled. "With the same noble behavior, we embrace the flag they waved with, and make our promise." The speech was ended with the words: "This flag will accompany every step we take to a classless and organized future, and it will always waver high . ”
 </p>
<p>
  Then the speaker took the word on behalf of Partizan and said, "We are together to share our voice, consciousness and enthusiasm with the immortal."
 </p>
<p>
  It is mentioned that the martyrs chose a path of death where living means to resist, and he said: "They chose to revolt against the rulers who imposed on the people in the society they were born into, misery, ignorance, submission and helplessness. They devoted their lives to the future of the people. "
 </p>
<p>
  In the statement, which affected the increasingly serious economic crisis, it was mentioned that not only a government but the whole system should be considered responsible for poverty. While it was explained that this was a period when local elections were on the agenda, it was emphasized that the real government power of the municipalities was the state and that successful work could not be done for the people of this system.
 </p>
<p>
  “We are experiencing economic crises where others become rich. Again, we are forced to make choices that others will win. It is possible to stand against them all. It has succeeded in the past. It will also succeed in the future. Besides, we have to do it as humanity. We will decide this by organizing us. ”The speech ended in touching the importance of organization with these words.
 </p>
<p>
  The event ended when the group ̇syan Ateşi went on stage.

  On February 6, it was a year since the devastating earthquake hit southern and central Turkey and northwestern Syria. About 60,000 people were killed and millions became homeless. On the anniversary, there were major protests in the areas affected by the earthquake, where they demanded that those responsible for the destruction be held accountable and their relationship improved. Many still live in containers and tents under unbearable conditions and face rising unemployment and exploitation. In some places, the state also tried to prevent people from protesting and celebrating the anniversary on their terms, e.g. in

  The vast majority of bourgeois media in the old Indian state has reported a new important action from the Maoist guerrillas, this time in Chhattisgarh, in the Bastar region on the border between the Bijapur and Sukma districts.

A few hours later, they were exposed to an intense attack with improvised grenade throwers and heavy machine gunfire. The attack was of high intensity, leaving three paramilitary killed and another 15 wounded. After the attack

<p>
  After the operation, the paramilitary forces and police declared that they had performed a search and attack operation against the Maoist guerrillas, but they did not find the bodies and there is no evidence of their existence. The creation of military, paramilitary and police camps, attacks on the population, false meetings and other oppressive operations are part of the usual actions of the ancient Indian state in the Bastar region, which is considered a stronghold for the Maoists. The last of the major oppression operations is 'Operation Kagar'.
 </p>
<p>
  It is the second time in less than two weeks that we report major offensive actions against the oppressive forces of the old Indian state. Last week, 35 agents from the Indian oppression forces were eliminated. As late as this month declared the Indian State Interior Minister AMIT Shah,
  <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/amit-shah-sets-three-year-deadline-to-free-chhattisgarh-from-maoist-menace/article67763170.ece">
   that he was aiming to eliminate Maoism over the next three years

  . But the truth is that by the beginning of 2024 there has been an activity recovery against the old Indian state.

   (CASR) requires immediate release of student activists Shakhdeep and Abhinav Das!
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  January 31, 2024
 </p>
<p>
  On January 29, 2024, students from Revolutionary Student Front (RSF) in Kolkata, Shakhdeep and Abhinav Das, were arrested by police in Bidhannagar and imprisoned until February 1st. Several democratic rights, such as association for the protection of democratic rights (APDR) and student organizations, organized a protest at the International Book Fair in Calcutta, where police triggered violence against protesters and detained 14 people. Shakhdeep and Abhinav Das were among the detainees and were later charged with section 353, 186, 506 and 34 of the Indian Criminal Code. As far as we know, the two denied bail on January 30, 2024, and they have now been moved to legal custody until February 1st.
 </p>
<p>
  The case began on January 28, 2024, when students from RSF and many other social policy activists demonstrated at the same international book fair in Calcutta to relieve political prisoners Prashant Bose, Pramod Mishra, Sheela Marandi, Arun Kumar Bhattacharya, Jayita Das, Sabyasachi Goswami, Pratik Bhowmik, Montu Mallick, Manik Biswas and Amiruddin Ahmed. Casr recently published a statement about some of these arrests and how the Indian state continues to violate all legal procedures and make fun of his democratic rights as it stamps political activists with the red stamp "Maoism". Some of these activists are in the late '70s, and their lives are now in custody of the same Indian state that has committed the murder of Pandu Narote and 84-year-old father Stan Swamy because of medical negligence. The protest on January 28 was about the increasing number of arrests of political activists with the excuse that one would catch "senior Maoist leaders". In particular, the arrests go beyond political activists who are fighting for the working class, peasants, the oppressed women's and the casters 'case, as well as against Adivasis' Landgrab and the fight for Jal-Jangal-Jameen.
 </p>
<p>
  The protest on January 28 was also about the requirement of immediate initiation of a trial for these political activists, where many of them have been in police custody for days, without their families and the public having received any reports or information on where they are located . The protesters on January 28 were also met with undemocratic oppression when police canceled the protest at short notice. Police tried to grab the activists' phones and delete the footage of their attacks on activists during the detention in an undemocratic way. During the same period, the police failed to intervene when Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) attacked political activists and owners of book stalls who had set up posters in solidarity with the Palestinian national liberation movement at the same book fair. The Mamata Bannerjee-led West Bengal Government's indulgence and service to the Brahmanian Hindutva-fascist forces and their politics is visible in the way it deals with pro-popular democratically minded activists towards fascist mob groups. The same Trinamool Congress government in the West Bengal has ensured that the fascist restriction of the struggle for democratic rights and the general restriction of political disagreement is pursued recklessly, where even the demand for the release of political prisoners such as Pramod Mishra, Prashant Bose, Sheela Marandi, Sabyasachi Goswami And others have become an act that justifies police brutality, torture and arrests of students.
 </p>
<p>
  Casr is deeply concerned about Shakhdeep and Abhinav Das' well -being and condemns police brutality and their politically motivated arrests.
 </p>
<p>
  CASR requires immediate release of Shakhdeep and Abhinav Das and the release of all political prisoners!

They had stormed the construction site and declared that the construction should be stopped, after which they set fire to the machines. According to reports, 50 armed Maoists participated in the action. These road connections are used to improve reaction mobility in the fight against the People's War or to better serve large imperialist companies' utilization of raw materials in the interior of the country. This action is part of the frequent sabotage of a road building project in Chhattisgarh's Bastar division. The suspected attackers could not identify a subsequent police action.

<p>
  The ancient Indian state repeatedly claims that the People's War will be defeated in the coming years, and it has now launched a series of oppressive operations, which meet fierce resistance from the guerrillas as well as the masses, which in many villages protest the presence of the so -called 'security forces '.' Already in January, the old state has received hard blows. That

  Facam has learned that the Indian State has again used drones to
  <strong>
   Air bombings in Mettaguda, Errapali and Bottethong on January 13, 2024
  </strong>
  . These villages are located on the border of the Sukma-Bijapur districts in Chhattisgarh.
  <strong>
   In another recent incident, Ramesh Poyam from the village of Bodga in Bastar was shot by the bullets of police and the paramilitary forces on January 30, 2024
  </strong>
  , when he would take a bath in the nearby river. The forces were allegedly on their way back from the Abujhmad region after blasting a 130-meter-long Maoist tunnel and destroyed the Maoists' Martyrs' Memorial 'when they got into battle with the Maoist forces. After the shooting stopped and Ramesh went to the bath, he was allegedly shot by the forces, and once again the killing has been justified with the excuse "Cross Herring with Naxalites". Ramesh had come to his sister's house to invite her to a party on the occasion of his child's birth two days ago.
 </p>
<p>
  The unery -laid civil war in central India has escalated rapidly in recent months. The killings of Adivasi farmers are justified either as a "Maoist clash" or "cross-fire", and the life of the Adivasi farmers is simply made into statistics of consequential damage in the state's "anti-naxal operations". Moreover
  <strong>
   is the fifth time within a three-year period that the Indian state has resorted to throwing bombs in the head of its own population as part of Operation Samadhan-Prahar
  </strong>
  in the effort to quickly expand the looting of natural resources in the region and eradicate the adivasi farmers through large-scale militarization for this purpose. These villages are not strangers to such bombings. Mettaguda and Bottethong have been repeatedly the air bomb since April 14, 2022, when 35 explosions took place in the villages and the surrounding areas. Exactly one year before the current incident, January 11, 2023, the villages of Metaguda, Bottethong and Errapali were exposed to these bombings. In an investigative report published by coordination of organizations for democratic rights (CDRO) entitled »
  <em>
   When the sky spits fire
  </em>
  «About the air bombings on January 11, 2023, a local says:“ We had gone out early in the morning [in the woods] to collect Mahua magazines when a drone suddenly came from the top and threw bombs down over us. We did not understand what happened. ”Adivasi farmers who cultivate their traditional activities of gathering mahua magazines to sell them finds no peace in their lives as the Indian State's Operation Samadhan-Prahar uses more and more folk murderous methods To wipe out their existence, all under the pretext of fighting Maoism. The use of drones for air bombardments has now also become a practice that takes place not only in Bastar, but reportedly in other parts of India.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   On January 8, 2024, reports of drone -based air bombings near the border between India and Myanmar
  </strong>
  , which was allegedly aimed at the Assam-based rebel group united national liberation front in ASOM (independent), which does not participate in peace talks with the Indian state.
  <strong>
   Four days later, on January 12, 2024, reports came that the Indian state used drones again to throw bombs near the Pangsau border in the Changland district of Arunachal Pradesh, which is a densely populated area
  </strong>
  . Once again, the attack was carried out with the excuse that it should limit a separatist movement, this time the Naga movement-national Socialist Council in Nagaland- Khaplang (Yung Aung).
  <strong>
   Over the course of five days, the Indian state made drone attacks in three different parts of the country, aimed at Adivasi farmers in Bastar and oppressed nationalities in the Northeast, just a few days before the state celebrated the adoption of the Indian constitution, and that India became a so-called republic.
  </strong>
  We believe that this expansion of air strikes is a reflection of an experiment performed in central India and which has been conveniently killed by the state and has therefore not been subject to sufficient scrutiny. Also, it should come as no surprise that the Indian state is increasingly using Israeli-made Heron Mark 2 drones for these air bombardments and now has not only become the world's largest weapon buyer but also Israel's largest weapon customer importing a number of weapons , unmanned aircraft, missiles and even technology such as Pegasus surveillance software that it has used against democratically minded activists. Similar to the Zionist state and its restriction of the Palestinian people's right to self -determination and the genocide it performs in Gaza, another attempt at genocide while sailing in Bastar with mobilization of 3000 paramilitary forces during Operation Kagar is. The use of air bombs in internal conflicts that jeopardize the life of the civilian population, regardless of what the political cause may be, is not only a violation of democratic rights in the Indian constitution and national law, but is also an international problem as it is in Review with the Hague Convention of 1907 and Protocol 1 to the Geneva Conventions.
 </p>
<p>
  This escalation of the war in Bastar alone witnessed the murder of a child of 6 months in Mutvandi on January 1st, the false meeting with 3 peasants in Nendra on January 16 and the killing of Ramesh Poyam on January 30. Right now, we are receiving information from members of Moolwasi Bachao Manch that forces have fired rocket grenades in villages around the newly created camp in Tekalguda, where they lost 3 CRPF soldiers, and 14 were injured in the Maoist attack on a building on January 30 2024. We believe that the escalation of the war caused by the increased militarization and the Maoists' counter -attacks will cause the frustrated soldiers to carry out more reckless attacks like these in the coming days and that it will create chaos for Bastar's population if Not the democratic progressive forces across the country are together to fight it.
 </p>
<p>
  We repeat the same question that was asked by an adivasi farmer:
  <strong>
   »
  </strong>
<strong>
   Why are there these attacks in Bastar? Is it a foreign country? We have to go in the field to get something to eat, and the soldiers fill our bodies with bullets. What does the Indian government do to stop it?

<strong>
   ● In the current regime, NIA acts as
  </strong>
<strong>
   'National Implicit Agency'
  </strong>
<strong>
   , Which is in front to crush the deviating voices!
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  On February 8 in the morning, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) conducted a raid in several places in the four states of Telangana, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. In Hyderabad, the well -known author and journalist N. Venugopal and N.Ravi Sharma's house were searched. Over the past six months, NIA in Telangana has often searched various social and political activists and tried to involve them in false reviews. N.Ravi Sharma is a writer and rights activist whose house was searched by NIA once and by the state police a second time recently. N.Ravi Sharma was also arrested in 2019, but they were released against bail because the state has no evidence that this activist is a member of the forbidden IKP (Maoists) and is involved in violent activities. He has worked in the forum against Hinduthva-fascist offensive (FAHFO) to counter the rising wave of Brahmanist Hindutva fascism and reveal its popular nature. For this very reason, it was banned by Telangana's government in 2021 together with 15 other organizations. Later, after three months, this ban was withdrawn by the government itself when it was challenged in Telangana's Supreme Court.
 </p>
<p>
  On the same day, Nia makes a raid with the rights activists Ismail and Rashid in Mallpuram and Palakkad in Kerala. It is also reported that two more raids have been completed in Thane, Maharashtra and Chennai, Tamilnadu the same day.
 </p>
<p>
  N. Venugopal is also the editor of the popular Telugu Month Month magazine "Vekshanam" and nephew of Varavara Rao, a revolutionary poet who was mistakenly charged with the notorious Bhima Koregoan case. N Venugopal has many times been attacked by Telangana police because of his political activism and deviant opinions. In his press release, NIA has claimed that "front -line members of IKP (Maoists) operated in the urban areas of Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala to promote the activities of the breakers". It clearly shows that the Brahmanian Hindutva-fascist state wants to stamp the movement of democratic rights in the cities such as the Maoists' above-ground front activity and crush all deviating voices. It is a practice that the Indian state has had for a long time, and these kinds of raids must not be seen in isolation. They are part of the Indian state's propaganda to criminalize all democratic voices that are critical of its exploitation and oppression of the country's population.
 </p>
<p>
  Telangana has a brutal history of state oppression of democratic rights. Previously, the police, along with the intelligence services, have obviously killed many democratic rights activists in false meetings. In the last six months, Telangana has surprisingly seen various fours, with more than 140 leaders of civil society and mass organizations being implicated in UAPA cases, even those who died two years before FIR were registered.
 </p>
<p>
  As in the Bhima Koregaon case, where NIA struck down on activists across the country using a letter allegedly contained a conspiracy to kill India's prime minister. It is NIA's Modus Operandi to build a tale through the media that before the Razzia arrested a Maoist leader and found a diary with the names of these activists. All over India, the houses of various lawyers, students, journalists, professors and democratic rights activists were searched and the same story was repeated. NIA uses this kind of diaries as a toolbox throughout India to implicate various activists in fake cases.
 </p>
<p>
  During the colonial period, the state used its arbitrary power to implicate revolutionaries in conspiracy cases such as the Meerut Conspiracy case and the Lahore Conspiracy case to suppress people's movement against colonial exploitation and oppression. Today we see that the Brahmanian Hindutva-fascist BJP-RSS government learns from its colonial stewards and uses similar tactics to suppress voices against the exploitation and oppression of the people, as well as voices that are against foreign and domestic companies' looting of the country's resources.
 </p>
<p>
  Campaign against state oppression (CASR) condemns this oppressive measure in the form of NIA. We believe that this act is an attempt to divert the issue of democratic rights and popular affairs to "red horror" by stamping those who raise questions, like Maoists. We urge all democratic and progressive forces to oppose this raid and a major attack on democratic rights.

<p>
  Tuesday, February 13, a march of
  <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/protesting-indian-farmers-clash-with-police-for-a-second-day-as-they-march-toward-the-capital/ar-BB1igpi8">
   Tens of thousands of peasants in India
  </a>
  , especially from Punjab and Haryana, towards the country's capital, New Delhi. They loaded trucks and all kinds of vehicles with food and equipment, ready to travel for a long time and camp in the city if needed. All this happens after failed negotiations with the state authorities, who have obviously deceived the peasants after giving several promises in the past.
  <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/13/india-farmers-march-what-are-their-demands-why-is-govt-blocking-roads">
   Since Tuesday, police have shot with tear gas
  </a>
  , fortified the capital and attacked the peasants violently to prevent them from reaching their destination. The Internet has also been interrupted in many places in Haryana, and meetings of a certain size in the capital have been banned. Although most farmers are from Punjab and Haryana, there are groups from Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, who join the protests.
 </p>
<p>
  Indian peasants and the current Indian government have come together before. Between 2020 and 2021 there were major protests, and after them Modi and BJP had to withdraw a number of measures that liberalized the agricultural market. In addition, they promised the peasants to take a number of measures, the most prominent of which was to secure the price of the farmers' products to avoid loss for them. Some time ago the Indian government had
  <a href="https://scroll.in/article/885312/explained-the-increase-in-minimum-support-prices-for-14-crops-and-what-it-means-for-farmers">
   already promised to double peasants' income
  </a>
  by 2022, which was not once again fulfilled. In 2022, the Indian government also promised peasants to stabilize a number of guaranteed prices to maintain the existence of the hard -tried Indian peasants.
 </p>
<p>
  All of this has served as a growing broth, so Indian peasants rebel against the ancient Indian state. Finally, after years of waiting and abandonment,
  <a href="https://www.deccanherald.com/india/delhi/explained-why-farmers-are-marching-in-protest-to-delhi-2893643">
   requires the Indian peasants guarantees
  </a>
  , either through prices set by law or with more state aid, including that the government guarantees state reserves of food and buys products at the minimum prices agreed with the farmers. Another requirement they have is
  <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/13/india-farmers-march-what-are-their-demands-why-is-govt-blocking-roads">
   Agricultural loan remission
  </a>
  , and that income exceeds more than 50 percent of production costs. The most active peasants have been the ones from Haryana and Punjab because they have been the largest recipients of the minimum prices that have been set in recent years,
  <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-in/news/India/explained-why-mainly-farmers-from-punjab-want-legal-msp-and-what-makes-their-demand-so-complex/ar-BB1ij9ot">
   Since they sell most of their grain during this price system
  </a>
  .
 </p>
<p>
  BJP's government and the Indian ruling class have repeatedly shown that they do not seek to protect the interests of the peasants, but serve the interests of imperialism, primarily the Yankee's. Not only did they break the promises they made after the strong protests in 2020-2021, but lately, the farmers' living conditions have also worsened after the new agreements with the imperialists on the sale of land. Another action that worsened the Terms of the Peasants came a few months ago after the G20, where an agreement was made between Yankee imperialism and the Indian ruling class: India lowered the taxes of many very important agricultural products for Yankee imperialism's economy, which paved the way for mass imports at the expense of local farmers' production.

  To these protests and the enormous mobilizations of peasants who resolute marching to Delhi, the old Indian state has performed several actions: It has fortified New Delhi and cut off all access to the peasants.
  <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2024/2/13/tight-security-and-barricades-as-indian-farmers-march-to-new-delhi">
   It has protected the borders of the city
  </a>
  , as if they were boundaries from one state to another with whom they were at war, but against their own people. In addition, they have triggered a brutal wave of oppression with unprecedented actions, such as bombing protesters with tear gas from drones. In addition, there have been violent clashes with the rebel police where the peasants have stood firm and fought, and they have even

    We publish an official translation of the following statement from case.
   </em>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  After the negotiations between farmers and the government failed this morning, "Kisan Mazdoor Morcha" started their Delhi Challo March to get the modi government to remember its promises of farmers' demands that the Indian state has not fulfilled.
 </p>
<p>
  Drone Image and Information Service in Haryana Limited (Driishya)
 </p>
<p>
  The Brahmanian Hindutva-fascist state was fully prepared and armed, even before farmers started their agitation and closed the Internet in many districts in Haryana, and farmers' leaders and some YouTuberes Twitter accounts also held back and had fenced the state's borders with concrete barrikades and sharp nails , which made it look like an international border between two countries. They not only used drones to tear the protesters, but police and other armed forces also used air rifles during the protests. Many farmers were brutally wounded and hospitalized. Police are using drones made by drone image and information service in Haryana Company (Driishya), a limited company founded in 2021 under the pretext of measuring horticulture and agricultural crops.
 </p>
<p>
  The brutal suppression of the peasant movement cannot be seen in isolation as the Indian state in several places in India treats protests such as terrorist activities, and to deal with these protests, they beat protesters and imprison them for implanting them in false cases and if these methods do not work, Uses the state of aerial bombardment as a remedy in forest areas in Bastar to close the mouth of the people's struggle struggling to protect their own democratic rights.
 </p>
<p>
  Delhi, which is the capital, also has the same situation where disagreement is not allowed, and people are prevented from expressing their opinions, the permit is canceled by the police under the pretext of a situation of law and order and other vague reasons that are completely baseless. The fascist state is trying to stop the political expressions of farmers and raise their own reasonable demands when they are not allowed to enter Delhi. Both of these situations are the same and both things are related to the struggle for democratic rights in India. This is not only a protest, but a process where we regain democratic spaces that are not only closed to Delhi's civil society but also to the peasants.
 </p>
<p>
  India has a brutal history of oppression of different peasant fighting throughout India. During the peasant movement in 2020-2021, when they came to Delhi, more than 800 peasants lost their lives due to government arrogance and ignorance.
 </p>
<p>
  Casr strongly condemns the fascist state's brutal oppression of peasants' protest to crush the peasant movement's political claim and demand that all barricades be removed immediately and that Mazdoor Kisan Morcha is allowed to show their disagreement.

  The Sarona group, led by Juvie Sarona, has long been known by the inhabitants as a mercenary group supported by AFP/PNP and is usually employed by large compressor owners and fascist politicians. Among the many bloody debt of the aforementioned mercenary group is their involvement in what is now known as the Sagay 9 massacre on October 20, 2018 in Barangay Bulanon, Sagay City, Negros Occidental.
 </p>
<p>
  The Sarona Group is also involved in land grabbing, including problems with the country they control through AianDo. Boy Sarona, Juvie's father, administers all the earth under their control.
 </p>
<p>
  For fear of the mercenaries, the landowners could not negotiate the conditions of Aiendo. Their trees are unfairly felled and sold to sugar centers such as firewood. Usually, the unproductive/unplanted pieces of land they own are subject to AianDo conditions. Events with tractor and manual work erections were also reported by landowners as well as sugar cane farmers in the neighborhood. Land workers from former landowners (usually taken over by arander with the same terms as the original landowner) have been exposed to work problems during the Sarona group, such as detention of 1-2 days' salary per week and further forfeiture of wages when one cannot work it the following week.
 </p>
<p>
  The community around the land that the Sarona group controls also lives in fear because they are exposed to threats and harassment. Members of the Sarona group train their weapons and even shoot at the residents. A Carabao was once shot after accidentally damaging part of a sugar cane field controlled by the said group and the animal owner was still forced to pay for the damaged crops.
 </p>
<p>
  Negrosanons, especially the population of northern Negros, celebrate NPA's punishment of the Sarona group. RJPC-NPA is grateful for the boundless support of the population, which secured the successful action against the Sarona, a stone's throw from the provincial road, placed between two hostile departments (Marcelo and Pulupanguyan).
 </p>
<p>
  This military action conducted by RJPC-NPA is part of the guerrilla front's celebration of the 55th anniversary of the Filipin 'Communist Party (CPP). It is also a picture of the front's determination to recover from previous losses and rebuild the mass base.

<p>
  Major General Marion Sison is completely wrong if he believes that the Anti -Terroric Act will put an end to the popular democratic revolution, such as the New Folk Army (NPA), which is under the absolute leadership of the Philippines' Communist Party (PKP).
 </p>
<p>
  The fact that the head of the 3rd Infantry Division greets the Supreme Court's procedure rules for petitions and applications in connection with the drakonian anti -terror law simply reveals how fascist he is. The law, which should rightly be called the Terrorist Act, will only increase the number of human rights violations and further nourish the sustained culture of impunity on Negros Island.
 </p>
<p>
  To resort to tyrannical measures is an expression of desperation on the part of the reactionary state. The 3rd ID can repeatedly declare that "the guerrilla front in Negros is dissolved" that "the areas are free of rebellion" and what do I know, but it cannot hide the obvious truth - the People's War is still undefeated, even after five years of counter -revolutionary War on Negros Island.
 </p>
<p>
  As long as the roots of the armed conflict are there, the people will continue to cherish, support and join their real army, NPA. The revolutionary movement is in sharp contrast to reactionary fascist institutions that act only in submissiveness to their imperialist masters.
 </p>
<p>
  Reactionary leaders are selfish and self -absorbed, while the rich treasure trove of the revolution continues to let older cadres train younger to promote the welfare of the masses. The old will be replaced by the new, and new revolutionary forces will take on new tasks against imperialism, feudalism and bureaucratic capitalism.
 </p>
<p>
  No matter how many millions of AFP (the reactionary Armed Forces of the Philippines (Filipins' Armed Forces)) and PNP (Philippine National Police) spend on indescribable war crimes, including air bombings and massacres, the political line of the revolution remains correct because it is based on the interests of the majority of the Philippine people. The Philippine masses are looking for real land reform and national industrialization, and no smart expressions from the National Task Force (NTF))-ELCAC or patch solutions from Barangay development programs can give them. Only a national democratic revolution with a socialist perspective can really solve the problems of the working masses-the same ones that the AFP butchers kill every day.

<p>
  As a spoiled child who gets rage attacks, #Dimasaligan79IB's commander-in-chief Colonel Lieutenant Arnel Calaoagan recently released a statement in which he boasted the terrorist stamp of CPP-NPA-ADF as a whole and Roselyn Jean Pelle Commanded Negros Guerrillafront of the NPA (RJPC ) in particular. Peace Saboteur Calaoagan, who is a trained fascist of American imperialism, flared up and tried to cancel the victory of the people, including the long-desired justice of criminals and counter-revolutionaries as the Sarona group, by simply stamping it as 'acts of violence'.
 </p>
<p>
  The population of northern Negros has long demanded the punishment of the Sarona group. Involvement in the massacre of nine country workers in the sagay metropolis (more known as the Sagay 9-massacre), soil theft and work abuse, especially in Barangays in Toboso and Calatrava, Negros Occidental, labor problems, contract problems for their timber business (cheating with payment to owners of timber and utilization of carpenters) and cohabitation with criminals are just some of the many crimes that this mercenary group led by Juvie Sarona has committed.
 </p>
<p>
  The Sarona group is also a counter-revolutionary gun-for-hire syndicate. These mercenaries are active intelligence agents for PNP, who monitor suspected NPA supports in the area. The RJPC-NPA asked for a meeting with the Sarona group to make them understand the seriousness of their actions and the consequences, but they did not respond.
 </p>
<p>
  The Sarona group was punished for their unforgivable acts against the population of Northern Negros as despotic landlords and counter-revolutionaries. The revolutionary movement does not allow business activities that jeopardize the safety and livelihood of the people within its territory. The RJPC-NPA has not traded with the Sarona group in connection with revolutionary taxation or other financial obligations.
 </p>
<p>
  AFP's complicity in such crimes and the pure hypocrisy of condemning actions to punish the Sarona group, which has proven to have committed murder and other abominable crimes against the people, show that Colonel Calaoagan and AFP are instruments to preserve the class interests of the landlords.
 </p>
<p>
  Calaoagans and AFP's terminologies and definitions are heavily polluted with the tale of imperialism, bureaucratic capitalism and feudalism. To them, "peace -loving individuals" (like Sarona) are those who willingly submit to imperialists', the great compressor of the great compressors and the local landlords, which will lead to "Peace of Peace". Meanwhile, they are stamping those who openly oppose such aggressions to defend a large number of people's lives and livelihoods as' terrorists', which according to AFP will result in ›Violence '.
 </p>
<p>
  Calaoagan's deceitful claims that #Dimasaligan79ib and PNP are "professionals who do their duty" ignored the many violations of rights against civil and poor communities in northern Negros that their ranks have committed, including the barbaric killings of Hors de Combat like Ella, Ka Monet, Ka Simo, Ka Huawei and Ka Brod, and declared them victims of false clashes.
 </p>
<p>
  It is RJPC-NPA's duty to take responsibility for its activities against criminals and counter-revolutionaries to protect the people from baseless accusations and fictional charges from NTF-Elcac and their whole-nation approach. NPA publishes its actions so people can be informed of the reasons behind each military action.
 </p>
<p>
  In a "He says she says" situation, RJPC-NPA encourages the public (and the media) to investigate the reasons for collecting truthful information. The large number of ordinary citizens are the impartial source of knowledge as opposed to AFP/PNP figures who are in the pocket of the landlords.
 </p>
<p>
  Although farmers and country workers are poor and live a modest life, they make sure their beloved NPA gets food and clothing. NPA, which is the real folk army, is always welcome and sought after by the working masses.

  Filipino's Armed Forces (AFP) 3. Infantry Division is more shameless than ever when they declare new Folk Army (NPA) Guerilla Lter on Negros Island for "dissolved" after two false clashes on January 15 and 17 in Calatrava and La Castellana in Negros respectively Occidental. In the second fake meeting, two civilians were taken prisoner and cold -bloodedly murdered by elements of the 62nd infantry battalion.
 </p>
<p>
  Units from Roselyn Jean Pelle command-npa northern Negros Guerrillafront are all intact and perform their revolutionary tasks with renewed glow among peasants and land workers, who suffer a lot from landlessness and slave-like wages introduced by notorious despotic hacientos and their mercenaries. The supposed camp that 79. IB soldiers plundered was staged, and the claim of the meeting was taken from AFP's worn drama manuscripts.
 </p>
<p>
  Meanwhile, 62. Ib used an old trick of releasing intelligence people who pretended to be confused, to monitor peasant societies and penetrate housing in La Castellana, especially Barangay Sag-Ang, prior to fighting. The 62. Soldiers persecuted families and individuals who had been hiding after they were red -marked and set as a target during the Philippine National Police (PNP) bloody synchronized improved police operations (Synchronized Enhanced Managing of Police Operations (SEMPO) 1 in December 2018 in the Guihulngan metropolis, Negros Oriental.
 </p>
<p>
  On January 17 at 1 p.m. 6.45 in the morning in brgy. Sag-Aang, La Castellana, victims Bernard Torres and Boy Baloy were abducted and then brutally killed by 62. IB soldiers. They were unarmed. More importantly, they were not members of the NPA, as opposed to the old Filipino army reports. In fact, there was no meeting between 62. Ib and NPA that day.
 </p>
<p>
  Bernard Torres, from BRGY. Buenavista, Guihulngan metropolitan, was Habal-Habal driver and a member of Piston Guihulngan metropolitan department. Boy Baloy, an elderly man, was on the other hand farmer and native to Bry. Linantuyan, Guihulngan metropolis. Both have experienced harassment from the state power since 2017. They would have been part of the death toll for the Uplan Sauron 1 if they had not been able to flee with other families.
 </p>
<p>
  It is clear that the 3rd ID, 302 and 303. Brigades and the six battalions under their command here on Negros Island are making fake news. Their "dismantled" illusion is jeopardizing Negrosanon's life, especially farmers and country workers. They become more ruthless in their anti-rebellion campaign and are committing more and more human rights violations.
 </p>
<p>
  AFP's basis for declaring guerrilla fronts on Negro's island "defeated" is further from the truth. It knows the people on Negros Island well. The NPA is growing all the time and its mass base is elaborated due to the deteriorating semifeeudal and semicolonial system. AFP deserves the anger of the people because of their continuing focused military operations that create terror in the peasant communities, their defense of foreign interests and local large compressors and landlords, and the exploitation of the people for military corruption.
 </p>
<p>
  The armed revolution is a historical necessity and inevitable. While the American Marcos II regime continues its oppressive socio-economic politics and the spoon of its imperialist gentleman, the broad masses consisting mainly of peasants and workers have to fight against landlessness, poverty, low wages, job security, hunger, soaring prices and the absence of social benefits.
 </p>
<p>
  The 3rd ID is in deception and state terrorism to the neck. Ultimately, its "dismantled" illusion will become its downfall.

<p>
  Red Commanders and Warriors from Roselyn Jean Pelle Commanded Norwegian Negros Guerrillaf front of the new folk army (RJPC-NPA) are alerted to the many reports of questionable plans to trick voting voters to sign the so-called "People's Initiative" (People's Initiative (PI)) To change the reactionary Filipino constitution of 1986.
 </p>
<p>
  Following further studies, RJPC-NPA units have concluded that citizens are deceived and forced to sign PI using the following ordinary empty promises or fictional reasons: Work offer under the TUPAD program, continuation and unchanged status of 4P recipients, petition that Press certain unnamed persons and 20 million PHP from Senator IMee Marcos, among others. Barangay officials and employees led the signature campaign in their respective areas through persistent house-to-house, group meetings or individual invitations. There was no discussion with the inhabitants about PI.
 </p>
<p>
  It is not surprising that several cities in northern Negros are in the top 10 above the largest number of signatures collected for PI. In these cities, residents are dependent on the monocultural sugar industry and suffer from uncertain jobs, miserable and unstable wages, get or no benefits and a standard of living from hand to mouth. It is easy to exploit the economic crisis because any solution to the immediate, worrying situation, just as false promises of the reactionary government's distribution financing project, are eagerly welcomed by people.
 </p>
<p>
  In addition, the cities of Sagay, Escalante and San Carlos as well as the city of Calatrava are now the subject of neoliberal programs to make room for solar parks, modular nuclear power plants, large water projects and economic zones. The local leaders of the cities mentioned mobilized their election campaign, including sitting officials and employees, and used misleading methods to collect a large number of signatures for PI to change the reactionary constitution to allow for foreign ownership of land and basic utilities.
 </p>
<p>
  While RJPC-NPA recognizes the right of the people to participate in the public initiative as a mechanism that allows citizens to demand reforms in the reactionary government, we condemn the misleading mechanisms to gather support for a PI that is left with the interests of foreign monopoly capital. On the other hand, RJPC-NPA praises a few mayors for their decision not to participate actively in such signature collections to PI and give the individual freedom to act (or not) in pi.
 </p>
<p>
  RJPC-NPA orders all units, including units from the people's militia and self-defense corps, to complete their study of the mechanisms behind the collection of signatures for PI, collect evidence, identify the main actors in this fraudulent signature collection and arrest persons taken on a fresh deed, to Interrogation and confiscate signature sheets as evidence and for further examination. Likewise, all revolutionary forces should reveal to the masses what the ultimate goal of this signature collection is, the people's initiative and the movement of charter changes.

<p>
  Apolinario Gatmitan Command-new Folk Army Negros Island Regional Operations Command (AGC-NPA) strongly rejects the 3rd ID's claim that they have "wound up" as much as one guerrilla front on the island. Until now, all five guerrilla fronts under the AGC-NPA continue to act as the Filipin 'Communist Party's (PKP) primary weapon in the long-term People's War through extensive and intensive guerrilla warfare based on an ever-wider and deeper mass base in their respective areas of responsibility.
 </p>
<p>
  It is no surprise that the reactionary state troops will not be pulled out of Negro's island after the ancient Filipino Army's 3rd Infantry Division pretentious claimed that the guerrilla fronts at Negros were already defeated. It is also natural for the governor of Negros Occidental, Eugenio Lacson, to repeat that kind of talk as he represents the yields and oppressors on Negros Island, which the mercenaries of the 3rd ID earn.
 </p>
<p>
  The sustained presence of the reactionary Filipino armed forces (AFP) on the island reveals their rubbish about a 'degraded' front and reveals the anti-raising campaign as a fascist to a neoliberal target. In order to present a facade of a dissolved front, AFP, Filipino National Police (PNP) and National Working Group (NTF) -Elcac-a series of attacks through military offensives and psychological war and intelligence operations on peasant societies, hides countless human rights violations by declaring false meetings and false Surrender and promote corruption-affected and relief programs such as Barangay Development Program.
 </p>
<p>
  Religious focused military operations in Negros continue to result in several human rights violations, most recently the search of a peasant home of 15. Ib and 47. Ib in Cauayan, Negros Occidental. There are about 600 cases of human rights violations committed by reactionary state forces on Negros Island under the US-Marcos II regime, which is monitored by the National Democratic Front (NDF)-Negros involving over 39,000 victims.
 </p>
<p>
  After ›dismantled {Statements and the recommendation to place Negros Island in a state of stable internal peace and security (stable internal Peace and Security (Sips)), bombarding reactionary propaganda machines the media with promises of› Development 'and "Progress". The plan is obvious-to suppress disagreement in resource-rich societies to pave the way for the interests of multinational corporations and large comprades. AFP/PNP/NTF-ELCAC are merely tools and fighting dogs for the ruling class and their imperialist gentleman who want to throughout neoliberal projects such as destructive mining and quarry from northern to southern Negros, a commercial plantation in Candoni city, expansive land recovery projects that must transform Bacolod metropolitan and Dumaguete metropolis into 'super' and 'smart' cities, environmentally unfriendly water projects or mega dams in northern and southern central Negros and other forms of financial attacks against the people.
 </p>
<p>
  In reality, the reactionary state forces will stay on the island to protect the large compressors, landlords and bureaucratic capitalists such as Governor Lacson in collaboration with the imperialists. The reactionary state needs its armed machinery to draw a picture of security for the ruling class so that it can continue to exploit and suppress the Negrosanonic masses.
 </p>
<p>
  While fascism and neoliberalism continue, Negrosanons find justice in armed resistance. In this semi -colonial and semi -feudal society, they have suppressed and exploited every day to support and join the revolutionary movement. As long as the few rulers, the NPA and the Democratic Revolution of the People cannot be dismantled.

  </strong>
  A meeting of the Socialist Front of Nepal, a coalition of four Communist and Socialist parties, took place today.
 </p>
<p>
  The meeting earlier scheduled for Sunday was postponed for today.

<strong>
   Patiala, District, February 17, 2024:
  </strong>
  Amidst the ongoing farmer protest, the Communist Party of India (Maoist) has extended its support to the demonstrators stationed currently along the Punjab-Haryana border.
 </p>
<p>
  According to a copy of the press release issued by the Maoist party, the Maoists have extended their support to the one-day shutdown call given by the farmer unions on Friday, February 16.
 </p>
<p>
  Via the press release, the Maoist party has alleged that the incumbent union government is corporate friendly and has been treating the farmers as enemies of the State. Further, while making an appeal to the masses for their support to the said protest the Maoists in the press release alleged that the government has continued to bar the entry of the farmers at the Shambhu village border.
 </p>
<p>
  The press release further claimed that all the demands of the farmers are legitimate but the government is not willing to fulfill them.

     The Congo: Superexpletation and displacement
    </figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   According to UNHCR, the UN Agency for Refugees, in 2023 the amount of “humanitarian emergencies” registered worldwide was the largest in the last 10 years and the projection is that by 2024 this figure will increase, in the Last year there were 43 emergency statements in 29 countries; In a recent report, the agency says that "this upward emergency trend in 2023 will remain in 2024 and the number of forced displaced people could increase to 130 million at the end of the year."
  </p>
<p>
   The town of Congo in Africa suffers every second of every day the drama and nightmare of the most brutal violence product of the dispute over the wealth in their territory; The figures are really shocking, 10 million killed people, 7 million displaced and at least 1 million violated women. In just one week, 150 thousand displaced were reported, every day they have to flee leaving behind the shattered bodies of their relatives and start wandering around the land waiting to be killed or die of diseases or hunger physics.
  </p>
<p>
   The Congo, called by many
   <em>
    The country cursed for its wealth
   </em>
   Save gold, copper, diamonds, lead, oil, coal, hamlet, manganese, zinc, tin; And above all there is 80 % of Coltán's world reserves that is the base mineral for the manufacture of cell phones and computers, along with this, they discovered 70 % of world cobalt reserves, necessary for the production of batteries.
  </p>
<p>
   On that soil full of countless wealth, 70 % of the Congolese population, that is, 96 million people live in the extreme misery. «All my children were beheaded. My mother too. They arrived at 10 in the morning shooting in the air. They surrounded the town and burned all things. They murdered all who tried to flee and chased anyone who hid in the forest. It is a miracle that has escaped ». This was described by Marié, who lost his mother, his two teenage daughters and his young children of three and two years.
  </p>
<p>
   It is an absolute holocaust that the people are living in the Congo, an indescribable tragedy that has as one of its worst features that the majority of humanity see it as normal in this world plagued by tragedies of different levels and in different parts of the planet. This condition of naturalness can only be the product of conceiving the current world as the only possible one, or as a product of a tragic "divine design."
  </p>
<p>
   But the reality is very different, it is not accidental that in every part where wealth is discovered, all the worst scourges of a society governed by the insatiable appetite of the gain of the bourgeois parasites and the imperialist powers who are launched as they are launched are immediately reproduced hyenas to be played at death everything that produces surplus value. In the Congo, the avidity of gain has triggered a reactionary war between two sides headed by the rebel group March 23 (M23) and the Army of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (RDC).
  </p>
<p>
   The media show violence in the Congo as if it were above all a problem between communities but the great battle is for minerals, on which the economy of the Congo mainly rests; The Congo Diplomatic Information Office published in 2023 a report that highlights that “the economy of the RDC is little diversified and depends on the exports of its natural resources, mainly of copper (especially) and cobalt that represent one more than 70 % of its total exports »
   <sup>
    1
   </sup>
   China and Canada being the main powers that have power in the mining economy of Congo through mining concessions, and in the case of the main suppliers in Chinese inputs and machinery occupies the main place with 32.1 % followed by Zambia with the 13 % and South Africa with 12 %, also China is the main buying country of the minerals that exports the Congo with 72.55 % followed and well from afar by South Korea with just 5.3 %. Will Chinese imperialism have much to do with the tragedy in which our brother people of the Congo live? ... Surely, and they are not the only ones, as confirmed by the publication of the portal thinks press when they denounce in their article about the massacre in the Congo that: «A militia of Rwanda that is supported by the Western powers of the US, the United Kingdom, France and Israel are killing people in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to achieve its natural resources, the coltan or the cobalt, minerals used to create electronic devices »

<p>
   Capitalism is the ultimate cause, the background, the deepest, the one that must be attacked and destroyed completely, so the "humanitarian emergencies" are increasing, so there are so many wars and genocides, so nature intensifies its Virulent reaction against those who are destroying it with their insatiable gain appetite. It is therefore not a problem of making humanitarian aid campaigns to feed villages that live on mountains of wealth.
  </p>
<p>
   The world proletarian revolution is the only exit that the masses have, not only of the Congo, but those of the whole world, healing the wounds, burying their dead and raising their heads to arm themselves from powerful revolutionary armies guided by strong and proven communist parties Revolutionaries ... That is the way, which for many circumstances can be very difficult, but, there is no other, and for that we will have to travel as the only way to end this oprobious system.

<p>
</p>
<p>
  In the abolition of the 1st Piraeus Gymnasium in the school complex of Afentoulis Street, Deputy Minister of Education Z. Makri made a decision on 31/1/2024, causing the fair indignation of teachers, parents and students.
 </p>
<p>
  The designation of the school as an experimental in essence removes the ability of the children in the area to continue their studies in their neighborhood high school. In these schools of "excellence", pupils and students are entered by draw and come from any area, without geographical restriction.
 </p>
<p>
  Priority, Piraeus Experimental Gymnasium is projected to welcome the student potential from Ralleia Primary and draw the other positions. The immediate consequence of the above will be for the pupils and students of 6 elementary schools in the area (20th, 22nd, 26th, 33rd, 50th, 55th) to share in remote high schools, creating sections of 27 students! They will be called upon to move several kilometers away from their homes and stacked in large sections, in inappropriate buildings, exacerbating the conditions of the learning process.
 </p>
<p>
  In addition, teachers of the abolished school unit are subject to a sudden adverse change in their labor rights after losing their organic positions. Their right to permanent and stable work is de facto questioned.
 </p>
<p>
  Another anti -populist decision on the right to education came from the government's side, at the same time that students and students are fighting against the Pierrakakis bill that paves the way for the establishment of private universities. Another problem is added to the many that the popular family has to face, struggling to get out daily, fighting with poverty and poverty, with precision and work insecurity.
 </p>
<p>
  This decision is a continuation of the issues bank in the high school that intensifies the lesson, making it endless hunt for matter and ... whoever can afford it. Supplement to the minimum entry base that leaves thousands of candidates out of higher education. While the announcement of the national diploma that will bring the Pan -Hellenic exams in the three grades of high school and create a wild grade and inhospitable high school for the children's broad mass.
 </p>
<p>
  At the same time, the recent adoption of the law on vocational education and training is presented as a way out for children who are thrown out of higher education, but the final destination is the workplace, with miserable payments and cut off labor rights through "training" and "training" of apprenticeship.
 </p>
<p>
  All of the above, but also the e -learning, the evaluation of educational and school units, the mergers, make it clear that the only plan of the government is education is for few and fine.
 </p>
<p>
  They are preparing for us and our children a future without perspective. To resist the barbarism they are preparing for us and our children. Attacking the right to study, work, rights will not stop unless we stop it. To stand by parents, students, teachers and to fight organized and collectively against government and system plans
 </p>
<p>

<p>
   Nadezhda Constantínovna Krupskaya was born on February 26, 1869 in St. Petersburg, the only child of Constantin Krupsky and his wife Elizaveta. They were a family of noble origin, but they had impoverished; Elizaveta worked as a governess and Constantine was a military.
  </p>
<p>
   As a child, Krupskaya became friends with a rural teacher, so her interest in education was born and wanted to be a teacher. When he was 14, his father died of tuberculosis, so when he completed the gym (in 1887), he had to use himself as a substitute teacher in that same place. That did not prevent him from enrolling, by 1889, in the history courses taught by the Women's University of Besutuzhev and enter a Marxist student circle.
  </p>
<p>
   In August 1891 she began working as a teacher in a night school to which manufacturing workers came, the five years of teaching there were fundamental for the development of her class consciousness, she concluded that the solution was in the powerful movement worker and looked forever to the fight of the proletariat.
  </p>
<p>
   At 25, in 1894, he met Vladimir Ilich Uliánov, a young man from the Volga region who dictated clandestine courses to the workers in the same neighborhood where she gave her Sunday lessons. In the summer of 1895 Uliánov traveled abroad to contact the founders of Russian Marxism who lived exiles in Switzerland and Krupskaya was in charge of clandestine circles.

<p>
   In September 1895, together with Uliánov, Mártov and others, they brought together the most committed militants of about twenty clandestine study circles that worked in Petersburg and founded the union of struggle for the emancipation of the working class, whose mission was closely linked With the mass labor movement and direct it politically, it was the preparatory step for the creation of a revolutionary Marxist labor party.
  </p>
<p>
   In December 1895 Uliánov was arrested and imprisoned; At the beginning of 1896 Mártov had the same fate, so Krupskaya was in charge of directing the union of struggle for the emancipation of the working class and in May 1896 he had to organize the great textile strike of Petersburg: 30,000 textile workers that They demanded the reduction of the workday. Comrade Krupskaya directed the first great strike in the history of Russia, a strike that forced the Tsarist government (June 2, 1897) to limit the workday to 11.5 hours, since before there was no limitation.
  </p>
<p>
   After the great strike of the weavers, the police made numerous arrests, including that of Krupskaya. After three months in prison he went to Kostromá to support a strike, but there she was arrested again and jailed in the fortress of Pedro and Pablo, where she would spend another three months. In March 1897, political prisoners were allowed, including Krupskaya, to wait for their sentence in probation.
  </p>
<p>
   A year later, in March 1898, Krupskaya was sentenced to two years of deportation in UFÁ, but requested that they send it to the Shusheskoe village where Uliánov lived. The authorities agreed to his request with the condition that he married him, then, he moved to that village along with his mother and in July he married Uriánov.
  </p>
<p>
   During exile, Krupskaya wrote in various newspapers and was part of the International Conference of Socialist Women. His experience as leader of the Petersburg textile strike allowed him to write the brochure
   <em>
    The working woman
   </em>
   , the first text of Russian Marxism dedicated to the question of women; The brochure appeared in 1900, signed with the pseudonym of
   <em>
    Sablina
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   As of December 1901 it was founded
   <em>
    spark
   </em>
   , a newspaper to link to the scattered Marxist organizations; Krupskaya became her secretary, because it was she who organized correspondence with dozens of agents that the organization had in Russia. It was in Iskra where he published his article
   <em>
    Women and childhood education
   </em>
   , to denounce that in the legislation of the time there were no rights for pregnant women: «The truth, those benefits are almost never granted. Without receiving the benefits and fear of losing their jobs, women work in the factory almost until the last day of pregnancy and try to return to work as soon as possible, even without being recovered from childbirth. That is why abortions, premature births and all kinds of gynecological diseases in the factory are so frequent ». For Krupskaya, the complaint of the exploitation of working women was very important, but also youth and childhood were primary issues, because on many occasions they worked the same hours as adults.
  </p>
<p>
   Iskra served as a bond between the dispersed circles and social democrats, and prepared the II Party Congress. In this congress, held in 1903, the Democratic Social Workers Party of Russia (POSDR) was formed. In the fight filed in the II Congress, Krupskaya took sides, in favor of Lenin, in the dispute that divided the POSDR into two groups: that of the Bolsheviks and that of the Mensheviks.
  </p>
<p>
   Under the direction of Lenin, in August 1904, a conference was held in Switzerland attended by 22 Bolsheviks, the main paintings that supported Lenin; There Krupskaya was appointed secretary of the Bolshevik newspaper
   <em>
    Vperiod
   </em>
   (Forward), whose first issue appeared on January 4, 1905; Thus, it was clear that two independent fractions had formed within the party, each with its central organisms and its press organs.
  </p>
<p>
   In 1905, Krupskaya participated in the III Congress (exclusively Bolshevique) of the Russian Social Democratic Party, gave the report on the activity in Russia and took the minutes of Congress. Between 1905 and 1907 he served as secretary of the central committee of the party. In 1906, from an village behind the Finnish border, Krupskaya worked as secretary of the new Bolshevik newspaper
   <em>
    Proletarians
   </em>
   , and it was the link between Lenin, who was hidden, and the work in Petersburg.
  </p>
<p>
   In exile Krupskaya had met Inesa Armand, they two, along with renowned Bolsheviques such as Ludmila Stahl and Alexandra Kollontai wrote (at the beginning of 1914), the first issue of the Bolshevik female newspaper
   <em>
    Worker
   </em>
   (The worker). The roll was confiscated before it could be published, but, thanks to the work of Anna Uliano-Elizarova, who had not been arrested as the rest of her edition partners, twelve thousand copies could be printed on the occasion of Women's Day of that same year. INESSA ARMAND AND NADEZHDA KRUPSKAYAYA were in charge of editing the first seven numbers of
   <em>
    Worker
   </em>
   (From March 8 to June 1914), as the Tsarist repression closed it and could not be edited until 1917.
  </p>
<p>
   In the editorial article of the first issue of Rabotnitssa, Krupskaya took advantage of the International Women's Day to point to proletarian women and the entire working class the following: «The women of the working class find that current society is divided into classes. Each class has its interests. The bourgeoisie has theirs, the working class has others. Your interests are opposite. The division between men and women is not very important for proletarian women. What unites workers workers is much stronger than what divides them […] "All for one, one for everyone!" This "all" includes the members of the working class men and women with the same title. The "female issue" for workers and workers is the problem of organizing the backward masses of working women. "
  </p>
<p>
   For 1915 Krupskaya wrote his work
   <em>
    Popular education and democracy
   </em>
   , which constituted a significant contribution to the development of Marxist pedagogy. Here a new interpretation was made, from the point of view of the working class, of the great democratic pedagogues Rousseau and Pestalozzi, Marx and Engels' theories were exposed on the relationship between education and productive work. In the last paragraph of his book Krupskaya sentenced: «While the organization of school activity is in the hands of the bourgeoisie, the labor school will be a weapon directed against the interests of the working class. Only the working class can make labor an instrument for the transformation of contemporary society ».
  </p>
<p>
   In that same year he was part of the Russian delegation to the III International Conference of Socialist Women, a Women's Congress against War. Before the 1917 revolution, more women than men were deported to Siberia for organizing revolts against the Tsar, which denotes the broad female participation in prerevolutionary movements.
  </p>

   In April 1917, by abdicating Tsar Nicolás II, Krupskaya returned to Russia on a armored train, along with Lenin, Inesa Armand and other companions. They settled in Petrograd. After the insurrection of July 1917, the provisional government, under the pretext that the slogans against participation in the war propagated defeatism, began a strong repression against the Bolshevik party; The militants of the party and their political work in hiding were key to building communication codes, preserving the data of the militancy and avoiding the confiscation of weapons; Krupskaya was strongly involved in that important task and in achieving the involvement of the workers.

  The last study of INPS also confirms the difference of 
 treatment of women who work
 </br></b>
 In Italy by the "young workers 
 to retirees ”as reported an article of the Republic of 22 February last, 
 Smely once again, with data and strongly, Meloni's propaganda 
 shouted by the electoral stages, and not only for the wage difference and of the 
 pensions, but also for the number of women at work since
 <b>
  unemployed 
 And inactive there are several millions of unemployed women.
  <o:p>
</o:p>
</b>
<p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  As for the so -called
  <i>
   gender pay gap
  </i>
  , And 
 that is, the difference in pay, you get there regarding pensions at 40 
 billion!
  <o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  “In 2022 they were paid by INPS 322 billion in 
 Pensions and assistance performance.
  <b>
   141 billion went to women
  </b>
  .
  <b>
   To men 180 billion
  </b>
  . With a difference of almost 40 billion. 
 This is despite the average, women are holding more than one pension, 
 As happens when reversibility is. AND
  <b>
   although the retirees are more 
 Numerous retirees: 8.3 million against 7.8.
  </b>
  Women are 52% but 
 they take 44%.
  <o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The causes, according to the study, but that women live daily 
 on your skin, they are “intermittent careers, chopped by needs 
 of maternity and care. Fixed-term and part-time contracts, chosen or mostly 
 forced. But also a structural difference in the hourly salary between man 
 and woman (horizontal segregation). Also in the public administration. AND 
 everywhere at the highest levels, those of the management, to whom women arrive in 
 few (vertical segregation). " All this ends "on the defendants' counter".
  <o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  “Il
  <i>
   gender gap
  </i>
  Start from work. - continues the 
 Daily - Also in 2022, the annual salary gap between women and 
 man in the private sector was on average 6 thousand euros per year: 17,300 euros account 
 24,500 euros per year, 97 euros against 106 euros per day. A difference of 40% 
 which, although calculated as the INPS does for the same conditions (age, contracts, hours 
 worked), never reset and reaches a 12-13% stable.
  <o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Almost half of Italian women work in part-time (47.7%) 
 against less than a fifth of men (17.4%). Paid days in a 
 Year to women are 221 against 234 of men. And this explains a lot of 
 you can. "
  <o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  And the public sector is not even saved, says the 
 Journalist, “considered safe and sheltered from inequalities. Instead no. " Why: 
 "The remuneration gap, albeit lower than the private individual, exists: 5,200 euros per year, 
 15-20 euros per day: 28,400 euros against 33,600 euros per year, 95 euros against 
 114 euros per day. The gap is created from the growing appeal in the PA 
 of short contracts, especially in school and healthcare, where the presence 
 of women is relevant. Even part-time, certainly less present than in 
 Private, it concerns women double men (6% against 3%). Two thirds of 
 All public workers are women. "
  <o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  “There is no escape even at home. Parental leave comes 
 asked 80% by women. And the gap with companions is very large, above all 
 up to the three years of the son. The fathers, when they ask, are mostly 
 workers of large companies and full -time. While 46% of mothers 
 applicants and part-time.
  <b>
   Women penalized at work, in the paycheck, a 
 house and then retired
  </b>
  . Not a nice see. " But it is clear that this study 
 is limited to direct or deferred salary (pensions) and not to

<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Therefore when the newspaper of the Agnelli puts “on the counter 
 of the defendants ... intermittent careers, chopped by needs of 
 maternity and care. Fixed-term and part-time contracts, chosen or mostly 
 forced "tries to give an" aseptic "," objective "picture of the state of 
 things, as if all this did not depend on the capitalist-imperialist exploitation system, 
 A system that must be reversed by a political and social revolution.

   Although he no longer has the media impact that he had in the weeks after October 7, 2023, the genocide against the Palestinian people by the criminal state of Israel has not stopped. According to the most recent
   <em>
    Weekly Bulletin on the situation on the ground
   </em>
   That the Palestine Embassy in Argentina, the number of Zionist barbarism against the Palestinians already reaches the figure of 30,105 people killed and 74,400 wounds, among which we find more than 100,000 Palestinian children who have been killed, injured or are missing under the rubble product of bombings.
  </p>
<p>
   Since then, the Imperialists have not ceased to support the genocide that Israel has been executing against the Palestinian people; and workers, oppressed peoples and revolutionary and progressive people in the world have been supporting the cause of the release of the Palestinian people. Moreover, this February 23 solidarity actions were carried out in some cities in Colombia, which, although they were modest, demonstrate the support that a sector of the Colombian people maintains with the Palestinian cause.
  </p>
<p>
   As part of that support that the Imperialists grant to the Zionists of Israel, since the end of last year the imperialists Yankees reactivated their international naval coalition to, according to them, "protect" the commercial flow and safety in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Adén in the face of the "threat" representing the hutis rebels of Yemen. The name that receives this coalition is that of "combined maritime forces" (CFM, in English). The coalition is under the command of the US Vice Admiral Brad Cooper.
  </p>
<p>
   Recently it was published in
   <em>
    The viewer
   </em>
   An article of notes entitled «Alto Turmequé: of necropsy, transfugas and agreements» (FEB/2024) signed by Óscar Alarcón Núñez. There we are told that in a statement from the Central Command of the United States Naval Forces on January 27, it is reported that Colombia has entered as a member number 41 of that CMF coalition, and the aforementioned Vice Admiral Brad Cooper that celebrated The announcement of Colombia's entry to the coalition: "We welcome Colombians to the largest international naval coalition, dedicated to maritime security and stability in the Middle East ...".
   <sup>

   </sup>
</p>
<p>
   Indeed, since January 29 it was confirmed that Colombia was integrated into this CMF coalition. Integration was also celebrated by both the US embassy in Colombia, and Luis Gilberto Murillo, ambassador for Colombia in Washington.

   The objective of that coalition that is hidden behind its speech of peace and maritime security is to defend the positions of the Imperialists of the West in the Middle East and their main Israel ally, since the hutis have carried out military operations against Zionist and positions against Zionist positions and Attacks against several ships of both Israeli companies and imperialist countries that sponsor the genocide, navigating in the Red Sea, actions that are part of the support that Yemen rebels have given to the Palestinian resistance.
  </p>
<p>
   The attacks against the Hutis rebels by the imperialists have not ceased since the Yemeni began their offensive in the Red Sea against the load ships and on Saturday, February 24, the military forces of the United States and the United Kingdom made bombardments in Against the hutis for the fourth time.
  </p>
<p>
   That the current government "of change" has integrated the Colombian Naval Force to the CMF makes it complicit
   <em>
    in the facts
   </em>
   of genocide against the Palestinian people, although
   <em>
    in words
   </em>
   It is demonstrated in favor of the Palestinian cause. In addition, the Lacaya attitude evidenced against Yankee imperialism that has already been exercising the Government of the Historical Pact as recently happened with the initiative to continue the construction project of an American military base on the Gorgona Island, passing over the protests of scientists, environmentalists and settlers close to the island.
   <sup>

   </sup>
</p>
<p>
   The Communist Workers Union (MLM) rejects and opposes Colombia to be part of the CMF or to be part of any action or decision that contributes to the genocide against the Palestinian people. We call on President Petro that, if he really wants to be consistent with the Palestinian cause and that his support goes beyond words, he must break diplomatic, economic, military and any kind with any kind with the genocidal state of Israel, to which expels the Zionist Ambassador Gali Dagan and that the Colombian Naval Navy - leaves the CMF coalition. Otherwise, his attitude will be the same political attitude that other governments of the world hold, oppose
   <em>
    In the speech
   </em>
   at different levels to genocide, while
   <em>
    in the facts
   </em>
   They militarily support imperialists and Zionists. We invite the popular workers and masses of Colombia to make these demands.

 Draghi, who in this case represents the genuine voice of the whole of the countries 
 imperialists of Europe, divided and fighting within them by history e 
 capitalist development level: the "paradigm change" is necessary for 
 "Compete with the United States in an increasingly armed and violent world" (see the 
 Manifesto of February 25) but also with China ...
  <o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  For Draghi the difference with other imperialist countries is 
 in all sectors: «In the
  <b>
   productivity
  </b>
  , in the growth of
  <b>
   Pil
  </b>
  , 
 in the per capita GDP ». "The global economic order in which Europe has thrived 
 it's shaken, "he says,
  <b>
   on high dependence on Russian energy
  </b>
  , give her
  <b>
   exports 
 Chinese
  </b>
  and from the
  <b>
   Dependence for defense from the USA
  </b>
  e
  <b>
   from the 
 digital industrial production
  </b>
  .”
  <o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  To give a turning point "Colossal investments are needed"! Alone 
 In the green and digital transition they need “500 billion a year, to pay the 
 cutting costs of 90% of emissions by 2040 (
  <b>
   800 billion 
 per year
  </b>
  , estimated the ECB president Lagarde;
  <b>
   75 billion to be given to 
 Born and respect the 2% commitment of GDP per year in arms
  </b>
  . With governments 
 who have their hands linked by the stability pact, it would be necessary to mobilize the 
 Private savings to feed European financial capitalism. In Europe, 
 he would have remembered Draghi, instead the fragmentation prevails and 250 billion of 
 Euro per year fall into Wall Street. "
  <o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  That the appearance of the "defense" is the main one, it 
 Confirm Valdis Dombrovskis, Latvian vice-president of the EU Commission, and “Uno 
 of the clients of dragons ":“ It is clear that the defense-dimensions will have a place 
 much more important in our agenda - said Dombrovskis - we have a 
 paradigm change from the basic supply chain model 
 on the efficiency of the supply chain model based on resilience. And it's 
 clear that even resilience and economic security will not reach the cost 
 zero. This will involve costs ".
  <o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  "Costs": money but above all as conditions of life and 
 work that fall and fall even more on the shoulders of the proletariat and the 
 Popular masses of all of Europe!
  <o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Despite the cannonate of the ongoing wars, despite 
 dead and wounded to thousands, despite the generalized destruction the representatives 
 of the bourgeoisie do not lose sight of their class interests! Every day they must 
 find the way to continue to guarantee their social system of death e 
 putrefaction ... every day, therefore, the proletariat and the popular masses have the 
 duty to find the ways to end it with this capitalist-imperialist system.
  <o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  PS.: of Mario Draghi this said Joe Biden, after having it 
 awarded as a "world statesman": "I congratulate my friend, first 
 Minister Mario Draghi ", awarded the World Statesman Award," for the 
 his work in making human rights progress on the planet. Draghi was one 
 powerful voice in promoting tolerance and justice and I thank him for the 
 his leadership ".
  <o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The correct vision on dragons expressed in this blog was 
 Instead this: "Man of the most servant of the servants of imperialism 
 USA ", for his watery support/commitment for war 
 interimperialist, for the increase in financing for NATO, for its link 
 with the worst reactionary regimes of the "USA", from Egypt, to 
 Türkiye, from India, to Libya, human rights and oppressor massacrators 
 of their peoples,
  <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">

  for its tolerance

<p>
  A year after the crime in Tempi where 57 people were murdered, the system continues to prove that it does not care about our lives and our future.
  <b>
   The people and the youth go out on the streets and question the anti -populist policies. For two months students are mobilized,
  </b>
  With general assemblies (unprecedented mass), occupations and mass demonstrations against Pierrakakis for private universities.
  <b>
   Farmers set up blocks against accuracy and anti -righteous policies,
  </b>
  against the new CAP and the general government-EU attack. Teleperformance workers are mobilized, strike and claiming rights.
  <b>
   Task-US and CERTH employees are mobilized
  </b>
  Against the redundancies of their colleagues and employer threats. The people and the youth show that the attack on lives and rights will not go easily.
 </p>
<p>
<b>
   At the same time the system intensifies its attack.
  </b>
  The anti -labor laws Hatzidakis and Georgiadis strike the rights of workers in the eight -hour, strike, trade union organization and beyond. Law 4777 and the Law Framework strike the rights of students in public-dimensional studies bring tuition, deletions and disciplinarys, the secondment of professional rights from degrees. The policy of class barriers with the EBE and the Bank of themes throws students from universities and the law on technical education throws students from schools and makes them cheap, exploitable, without rights. They have submitted the bill that allows the establishment of private universities and will directly affect the rights of those who study in public with tuition, more intensification of our terms of study, more class barriers, abolition of trade unionism and fragmentation and degradation. They want to bring the national diploma that will mean nationwide for all 3 classes of high school.
 </p>
<p>
<b>
   Their attack should not pass! The claims that have erupted, students, students, farmers of the rest of the people have scared the system. That is why he is recruiting repression to stop them, so students impose on the students, so he brings out the strikes, unions and collective claims in illegality.
  </b>
</p>
<p>
<b>
   We have to make their fears a reality.
  </b>
  The struggles of the students, the workers, the whole people must be linked to each other.
  <b>
   Our claims are our lives and our future. They relate to the defense of our rights, the rights of the whole people in life, studies and work with rights.
  </b>
  Together we must fight for:
 </p>
<p>
</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>
<b>
    Increases in wages and pensions to cover the cost of living
   </b>
</li>
<li>
<b>
    Public - Free Education for all without class barriers
   </b>
</li>
<li>
<b>
    Labor rights
   </b>
</li>
<li>
<b>
    Professional Rights Degree - Unique Prerequisite for Stable Work
   </b>
</li>
<li>
<b>
    Against private universities
   </b>
</li>
<li>
<b>
    Against Pierrakakis and the Law on Vocational Education
   </b>
</li>

    Against the National Bachelor's Degree
   </b>
</li>
<li>
<b>
    Against tuition, deletions and disciplinary
   </b>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>
   Through our collective struggles, unions and student associations, our general assemblies and occupations, strikes and demonstrations we will respond to anti -populist politics.
  </b>
  Through the collective and single struggles of people and youth, students and workers we will conquer studies - work - life with rights

<p>
  For weeks, youth and farmers have been on the road and stand against the seizure attack that has launched the system against their rights.
 </p>
<p>
  Students and students with mass assemblies, occupations and demonstrations clearly state that they will not accept the black future they are planning for government and system.
  <b>
   They defend public free education against a few and fine education!
  </b>
  At the same time, farmers are massively involved in the blocks against the anti -grocery policy and the EU, against the new joint agricultural policy claiming compensation for 100% of the losses and increases in incomes that cover the cost of living.
 </p>
<p>
  At the same time that these mass matches have erupted, the working class,
  <b>
   The workers and the people are increasingly immersed in poverty and poverty with precision crushing popular income.
  </b>
  The government knows very well that society is a boiling cauldron, so it is trying to mislead us with communication tricks such as the upcoming supposed increase in minimum wage. It is constantly equipped with new anti-labor and anti-populist bills, culminating in the laws of Hatzidakis and Georgiadis, which, among other things, abolish the 5-day-8-hour period and hit the right to strike and class trade unionism.
  <b>
   Tempi's crime revealed once again that our lives are sacrificed on the altar of profit.
  </b>
  A year after the prescribed crime and the mass strikes that broke out shortly thereafter, the system continues to prove to be indifferent to human life.
 </p>
<p>
  It is now clear that all that this system has to do with is cutting rights, poverty and a medieval work. It won't pass them!
  <b>
   It is imperative for workers to go out on the road, to claim wages, work and life with rights.
  </b>
  Against the silent fish that trade unions are trying to impose, culminating in the attitude of the GSEE, which announced a strike on April 17!
  <b>
   To massive the upcoming strike, alongside the youth and the farmers who are already struggling, on a front -system resistance front!
  </b>
  Only the massive and relentless struggle of people and youth can put a brake on anti -populist and anti -labor policy!

    It is solidarity with the companions and colleagues of the
    <b>
     Popular Mountain Front
    </b>
    of Guerrero after the repression committed against him last February 15, 2024 when the FPM was mobilized in the municipality of Tlapa de Comonfort, Guerrero.
    <a name="more">
</a>
<br>
</br></span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">
<span>
    The partners of the
    <b>
     Popular Mountain Front
    </b>
    They maintained five highway blockages for 33 hours in demand that the municipal and state authorities meet a series of fundamental demands of a fundamental nature such as drinking water, the construction of schools and the relocation of a group of merchants adhered to the FPM recently evicted by the municipal authority.
    <br>
</br></span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">
<span>
    The response of the municipal and state governments has been the most bestial and shameless repression in the hands of drug-de-elderly groups disguised as carriers, a situation that is not only seen in Comonfort's Tlapa but in the entire state of Guerrero where the unhealthy violence of these Groups has come to paralyze transport, in addition to commercial and educational activities in municipalities such as Acapulco and Chilpancingo.
    <br/>
</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">
<span>
    We want to emphasize that the FPM struggle arises from communities, which before the closure of the State have determined to mobilize in the highway blockages where minors were in the company of their mothers fighting. The criminal groups paid by the State were particularly crossed against the companions and their children to impose terror and demobilization.
    <br/>
</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">
<span>
    That nobody is doubting: the political use of gangsterile and narco-de-inconential character shock groups to repress the popular movement is the means by which the different levels of government and the different electoral parties of the regime try to silence the protest and the resistance of workers and peoples throughout the national territory. This scenario is exacerbated, the more the violent elections of the regime are approaching, which makes it clear that voting in the next elections only serves to legitimize the bureaucratic path and state terrorism. The only valid alternative for popular masses remains the call to the boycott against the bourgeois electoral farce.
    <b>
     Do not vote, organize and fight!
    </b>
<br/>
</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">
<span>
    We greet the fair struggle of the companions of the
    <b>
     Popular Mountain Front
    </b>
    From Guerrero, we hug the victims of repression and tell them that it is possible to stop the war against the people as long as workers and peoples unify our struggles in action and based on solid principles, democratic and revolutionary.
    <br/>
</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">

    We demand that the municipal governments of Gilberto Solano Arriaga, the state government of Evelyn Salgado Pineda, and the federal government of Andrés Manuel López Obrador:

Testimonies will be done by those who are directly affected by the case, and the Judging Committee will carry out an inspection visit and listen to the case’s lawyers’ report on the crimes committed by the land grabbers so that, on March 10, 2024, each member can comment about everything they read, saw, heard, exposing their personal considerations and evaluations. In the end, a single report will be produced with the necessary steps”, it concludes.

  </a>
  in several areas of the country, including casualties, defections of troops, captured military material and police and military bases taken. Among these triumphs of the people of Myanmar, in these weeks the victories in the State of Rakhine have especially stand out, where the Arakan Army (AA) acts, a member of the Brotherhood Alliance which months ago has launched Operation 1027. Previously there were already advances of the struggle in Rakhine, where military bases were seized and hundreds of military defections to Bangladesh have occurred,

   as we reported

  <a href="https://www.dhakatribune.com/world/asia/339852/arakan-army-claims-myanmar-junta%E2%80%99s-withdrawal-in">

  .
 </p>
<p>
  Myanmar’s regime is in a sharpen crisis in Rakhine, and due to this, has unleashed the most brutal and bloody repression, trying

  , which at the beginning of the middle of February was bombarded in more than 100 occasions in just a couple of days. During this week, many other Rakhine towns have been indiscriminately bombarded, attacking non-military targets such as markets, temples and even a hospital, which has been hit with larger and destructive bombs than used before,
  <a href="https://www.irrawaddy.com/news/war-against-the-junta/rakhine-on-fire-myanmar-junta-hits-hospital-with-most-devastating-bombs-yet.html">
   according to the AA

  . This is part of the massacre-campaign against the civilian population by the regime, which is unleashed in all those regions where resistance has a notable presence and

   local media report massacres in numerous places
  </a>
  .
 </p>
<p>
  Despite the terror campaign of the regime, these weeks the advance has continued and now Rakhine’s own capital, Sittwe, is beginning to witness
  <a href="https://www.irrawaddy.com/news/burma/sittwe-braced-for-street-fighting-as-myanmar-junta-retreats.html">
   the first combats in its streets
  </a>
  . Witnesses and local sources report that the regime has decided to blow up access bridges to Sittwe to prevent the advance of AA troops, but this has been useless. At the same time, the high military and administrative ranks of the regime have abandoned the city towards Thandwe, which is 200 kilometers to the south. Sittwe is in total crisis, with internet and telephone signal cuts, remittance transfer cuts from abroad, and many businesses closed for months. The advance towards the capital has been continuous by the AA, which has been taking
  <a href="https://www.irrawaddy.com/news/burma/arakan-army-seizes-myanmar-junta-police-station-near-rakhine-capital.html">
   towns, military bases and police police stations

  Once again the struggle of the people against the regime in Myanmar has shown that the bureaucratic-big landlord regimes cannot do anything else than increase repression and their crimes against the people, but this is useless to stop the struggle, because it encourages and pushes the masses to the war and accelerating the fall of the regimes of the local ruling classes and their imperialists masters.

   We strike on the 28th of Ferries

  To manifest

   Massive our resistance to Antilaiki LAILAPA!
  </b>
  For weeks, farmers have been massively out of the blocs against the government and the EU's anti -groomed policy that has ruined their lives. Students with occupations and demonstrations are struggling to prevent the bill on private universities, which aims to abolish the right to free studies and the stroke of democratic freedoms in the field of study.
 </p>
<p>
  The working class, workers are experiencing unbearable conditions at work and their daily lives, at the same time trying to get the month with salaries that reach only for the first few days, while accuracy is galloping. The government invites us to accept poverty and poverty, since their economy cannot stand, at the same time as it treasures the capital and spends 3.5% of GDP on military spending, dozens of billions on F-35s and other equipment programs .
 </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
  The so -called growth played by the ND government requires no rights work, up to the deep old age, intensification and inhumane working conditions with consumable workers who will be sacrificed on the altar of capital profitability. That is why it promotes one anti -populist bill after another and hits that it is left of free care (afternoon payrolls with payment and new "NSS"). in universities with repression forces to hit student occupations.
 </p>
<p>
  The peasantry's peasants in the country, but also in the rest of Europe, the movement of student youth, solidarity demonstrations in Palestinian resistance around the world, send a message of hope that workers, peoples want to live life with rights. Despite slander and state repression they insist on fighting for their right.
 </p>
<p>
  These struggles have not only the government and the parties of the system (PASOK, SYRIZA, fascist structures) that support its policy but also the sold -out GSEE leadership that has not only rejected any struggle against government policy but are stable System pillar. The responsibilities of the reformists are also huge, because at the same time they are talking about racing, their unions have dissolved their policy, and their great anxiety is not how these struggles will be united in a front against anti -populist politics, but How will they be redeemed in the polls of the upcoming European elections.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<b>
   THE MASSIC PARTICULAR RACE THE ONLY A REAL DISCUSSION!

<p>
  It is well known that the Brazilian health scenario is chaotic. Overrexploitation, cases of coronelismo, salary delays, remuneration below the floor and lack of rights are among some of the problems that affect the category. In Amazonas, professionals in the area have denounced a truly calamitous scenario. “There are professionals, professionals of all categories, being outsourced, who are months without receiving, up to 7 months, this is absurd. So they are already threatening to take security, not go, so it will become even worse chaos. Water, capacity, overload on employees, employees being coerced, threatened, morally harassed. And it is not only at the 28 de Agosto institution, it is in all institutions, ”said Mauro Bastos, leader of the Todos for Health Movement, to the
  <strong>
   AND
  </strong>
  Em manaus.
 </p>
<p>
  Because of these serious problems, health workers are organizing for a major demonstration in front of the Federal Public Prosecution Service, to be held at 9 am on February 28.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   Check out the full interview below:
  </strong>
</p>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>
<p>
<strong>
   AND:
  </strong>
  Companion, starting this interview, would we like to know in general how you evaluate the health scenario in the state of Amazonas in recent years?
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   Mauro:
  </strong>
  Well, health in the state of Amazonas is as everyone is seeing there, being publicized in all media and posting, right? (…) There are professionals, professionals of all categories, being outsourced, who are without receiving, up to 7 months, this is absurd. So they are already threatening to take security, not go, so it will become even worse chaos. Water, capacity, overload on employees, employees being coerced, threatened, morally harassed. And it is not only at the 28th of August institution, it is in all institutions.
 </p>
<p>
  It's a real chaos. Public health in the state of Amazonas is scrapped. It is becoming a very serious thing and no one solves anything. No one solves anything. The Secretary of Health does not solve, the governor does not solve, the administrations they put within these units, by the way, everyone fell by parachutes, most have fallen inside with sponsoring, and do only what the system is sending, ready.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   AND:
  </strong>
  We see that health workers in the Amazon has a broad history of mobilization, having made major strikes and demonstrations during the last years. In this context, how did the construction of the all -health movement occur?
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   Mauro:
  </strong>
  This started long before this current scenario, right? This started there in 2019, where Samu's fellow Dennis raised the flag, right? And I raised another flag.
 </p>
<p>
  So it was in the time of the pandemic where we were overwhelmed, they did not make a decision. The current management did not make a decision to hire people. So we started to have many misconduct. And we started to raise flag, each in a unit. I went to 28 [August], Denis was at Samu, Paulo there for the Juveni, and we were uniting this strength. Approaching, approaching, because we charged unions, we charged advice to work for professionals, but nothing was done.
 </p>
<p>
  So it started there. In early 2019, all this kind of movement. Then this movement was founded, all out of health.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   AND:
  </strong>
  And since we talk about it, what is the position of the movement with regard to traditional union entities in the category?
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   Mauro:
  </strong>
  Well, we always call them to work with us, understand? I mean, we are the workers, they are the union. But in no way do they make themselves available, claiming whenever they have the authority to do this and they won't do it.
 </p>
<p>
  They won't do it for the way: they won't go against the government, get it? They do not go against the government. When in reality they should go to the worker. So they practically put themselves with the government, receiving order, seeing that neglect is there.
 </p>
<p>
  And today the Nursing Council, which in this case is my branch, the Denis branch, the Nursing Council is willing to accompany us, even will be there with us on the day of the demonstration, but no union will be there. If you're there, it's, how can I say, to “show up,” say they are doing, they are following, but at all. So much so that we send him an invitation for them to attend, they never attend.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   AND:
  </strong>
  We also know that Amazonas has a terrible history of persecution of workers leaders. Did the companions of the organization suffer any retaliation from companies or the government itself?
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   Mauro:
  </strong>
  Well, there is always persecution. I can report three facts. Our colleague here, Frank, was persecuted, according to his words, was chased in João Lúcio, if I am not mistaken, being mobilizing ahead of the mobilizations, taking the lead to request improvement of conditions for employees and even for the population, which depends on the system.
 </p>
<p>
  Companion Denis, he has persecuted, persecuted to this day. They have already released several things about his personal life, which has been proven yet and is in justice. He can say that himself, understand?
 </p>
<p>
  And to me, this is where the direction of the hospital, because I have shown the truth to the population [about the treatment of patients], punished me, returning me to the secretariat. The secretary inside had the director's friend, the director, and as he had superiority to lease me where he wanted, he retained me in a far away from my residence. Since in my financial situation, I have no financial conditions to be moving around every day.
 </p>
<p>
  And as a form of retaliation, I made a bank re -registration, where I had not received in December. And as a form of retaliation, when I did my re -registration, they filed my re -registration in January so I didn't receive it again, understand? Just for a way of punishing myself for what I showed. But regardless of this, I will not fail to show the truth to the population. Because it may be the mother or father of anyone who was in that situation there.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   AND:
  </strong>
  Now, when it comes to the general privatization tendency we see in the state, how do workers see this? Do you see a difference in treatment with outsourced workers in the sector before the others?
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   Mauro:
  </strong>
  In my view, to privatize health in the state is to give broad power to entrepreneurs. It is to take the responsibility of the state, which has to have the responsibility for the workers, and play in the hands of a businessman, understand? Then every right is over.
 </p>
<p>
  So that is, in this case, they raised the hypothesis of privatizing the 28 August. August 28 is a gateway. You can not do that! See Delfina [Aziz]. Delfina is the great white elephant. It's complete of everything, but you only go there if you pass the system to go there. So there is no reason to have a hospital of that size that does not serve the population, overwhelming the other three ready-to-state in the state of Amazonas.
 </p>
<p>
  So, and in case of difference, a difference between outsourced before too much, as you expose, in this case the state civil servant, agreed, has a difference in your rights. For example, a nursing professional gives 13 shifts and earns less than a nursing professional who gives 10 shifts. So Susam's maker wins more than outsourced maker. I mean, today a maker costs 7 thousand. 7 thousand reais per month, understand? And even costing this value, they have been four, five, six months without receiving. So, I mean, there is a big difference, you know? There is a great discrimination between one professional and another who actually performs the same function, has the same working weight, understand?
 </p>
<p>
  So it's complicated, it's complicated, it's very complicated to privatize health in the state of the Amazon, understand? If there was this general privatization, it would become such a big chaos that it would no longer be resolved.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   AND:
  </strong>
  And during the covid19 pandemic and the total collapse of health in Amazonas, health professionals were the population's defense front line against the virus, where we saw several of them even died as a result of the exhibition. At this time, there was no shortage of politicians to extol workers, but now, years later, how do you see the state's retribution to these professionals?
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   Mauro:
  </strong>
  To be honest, at that time of Covid, we were heroes, understand? Today we are humiliated. I mean, we only take it when they need it, after it ends everything back to normal. I mean, they forgot, they forgot.
 </p>
<p>
  I was one who made a video in front of 28 [August], a stoppage at that time, in 2019. There came several deputies in my private, wanted me to meet them, why? To take advantage, understand? To take advantage. Only I didn't go. I was excluding one by one. I didn't go because I knew they wanted to take advantage. Because as the video went viral, they wanted to take advantage.
 </p>
<p>
  So many of the colleagues died, got it? And colleagues who would almost be buried as indigent. Colleagues who spent 20 years working at an institution that did not have the consideration of sending a crown of flowers even, got it? Colleagues of humble families, unable to buy the coffin at that time here was too expensive, understand? And we had to make little quotinhas to be able to give a decent burial to our colleagues. And the situation of the state, I can tell you that it was totally silent against these professionals, understand? Totally silent, and today we are like this, destroyed, we are persecuted, we are humiliated, we are coerced, we are harassed, we live under pressure, we are working in double, understand? With overcrowded hospitals, without conditions, without inputs, without dressing material, without any things.
 </p>
<p>
  And the population revolts against us. We are helping the population, we are preserving the patient's health, we are taking care of the patient, but still they think we are wrong. When in reality it is the state that is being wrong, because the state does not promote health for them, which is their right, is the right to citizen health. Every citizen has the right to health, understand? Now, only it is difficult. So, so, since then the heroes is over, understand? We are today the clowns, in reality. We are clowns. System Clown. Did you understand? This is what happens.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   AND:
  </strong>
  And beyond the act on 28/02, what are the prospects for struggle for the category in the face of this chaotic scenario?
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   Mauro:
  </strong>
  This will only end when there is 100%improvement, understand? When everything is inside the axles, it is over. As long as there is a colleague, who is one, going through persecution, coercion, harassment, not receiving, being rioted by managers or even the system, we will always be there to help, understand?
 </p>
<p>
  The movement was created not to end. The movement was created to follow no end date. So it is a movement that we can say is infinite, there will be no end. It will always exist. We are still organizing some things so that we can make a thirst, have a movement, have a legal thing within the law that will support us. So that we can't just be in the hands of the unions, the councils, understand? This is how we intend to go.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   AND:
  </strong>
  Companion, we thank the interview a lot and, finally, we would like to say that the newspaper The New Democracy has the honor of placing itself with the just struggle of workers throughout its existence. Would you like to leave a final message for health workers and all other categories that, Brazil, are reading this article?
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   Mauro:
  </strong>
  Yes, I want to congratulate all health professionals from Brazil and say that you are true warriors. You who often leave your families, your family members to take care of the beloved sick of others.
 </p>
<p>
  This is very beautiful, but I also want to tell my professional colleagues, all health officials who do not accept, do not accept being humiliated, do not accept being coerced or even harassed. Always be in the fight, always charging what your right is.
 </p>
<p>
  And we will try to join strength so that we can have better health, better health for the population, better health for the health worker, that today the health worker is sick, is asking for help, but unfortunately our governors do not come with others Eyes, only see yourself. So, my dear ones, we will always be in the fight, we will always look for our achievements, seek what we deserve. And my thanks to everyone.

  On 23/02, residents of ladder closed the BR-101 with tires for the third day in a row, demanding justice to DeyVision Batista da Silva, who was surrendered and executed by the Military Police for any reason on the afternoon of 21/02, while talking with two friends.

<p>
  The murder occurred when the victim was talking to two friends. At one point, three Moto MPs, including the infamous police “Pitbull,” known for the aggressiveness, stopped in front of him. Pitbull surrendered him and soon threw it on his face. Deyvison was taken to the hospital and was kept isolated, with no possibility of family visit.

<p>
  At the time of the event, in a video released on social networks, a resident predicts:
  <strong>
   “Only the police entered the hospital, banned family members from entering the hospital, certainly to put something on the victim to say he is wrong. But we know not. The family [his] everyone knows, the whole neighborhood is moved ”
  </strong>
  . The version of the Military Police, confirming the resident's right forecast, falsely says that Deyvison was armed, which was denied by all witnesses.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  The manifestations
 </h4>

</video>
</figure>
<p>
  Hours after DeyVison's death, the staircase residents closed the BR-101 with tires. On February 22, residents continued to protest with the same intensity and indignation: they closed a bridge in the city center, made demonstrations in front of the police station, the Military Police Battalion and closed the BR-101 once again. On the third day of the demonstration, on 23/02, residents continued closing the BR-101, confronting firefighters who tried to erase the flames of the tires and who retreated against the popular action.
 </p>
<p>
  These three -day actions opened the strength and indignation of the stairs, who refuses to admit police neglect, and claims justice to Deyvidson and his seven -month wife. Pernambuco witnesses today the fair fury of a people who tired of seeing another worker being killed for nothing, without any liability of the criminal executors of the Military Police and the criminal state that protect them.

  In the late 1970s and the beginning of the 1980s, a grileiros consortium closely linked to the military set up on the border of Pará with Maranhão a 5 letters based on sesmarias. With the support of the “authorities” the documents of five farms, allegedly belonging to a Canadian group that owed them, whose areas initially added 54,000 hectares, were transformed “alchemically” into 387 thousand hectares of land! The scandalous case of grabbing occurred in Viseu, northeastern region of Pará. The notary maneuver was followed by a major conflict, to this day known in the region as “War of Cidipar”, as all these lands belonged to more than 40 thousand squatters, farmers and Garimpeiros, scattered by 36 villages, who had their source of subsistence. Against the military offensive launched by the landowners to effect the land grabbing, the Gurupi River Valley peasants opted a harsh resistance.
 </p>
<p>
  With a paramilitary group of 102 gunmen, armed with rifles, helicopters and the most modern war arsenal at the time, at the behest of Captain James Vita Lopes, the consortium of companies Propara, Jehosapar, Denasa, among others, started to expel and Assassination the peasants in the area of the “Citipar” Gleba from fraudulent documents in total connivance with the Pará State Government and the military who ruled Brazil at the time.

<p>
  The first peasant murdered in this war against the people was Sebastião Mearim, from the village Alegre. From this murder the men of the village gathered to discuss their defense. Hence, from this group, there is still little known figure outside the region, but undoubtedly stands out among the great peasant leaders of our country: Quintino Lira, the Quintino Gatilheiro, “Basty Goat Matador”, like him Even he said and proved. The nickname of "trigger" was in direct opposition to the gunmen, because according to him, gunslinger was the one who killed in the name of the land will lands and trigger was the one who killed for the people. Under Quintino's command, the peasants organized a self -defense of more than 50 regular men, reaching 200 at times. Deep connoisseurs of the woods, the peasants responded with war of guerrillas to reactionary war. And during his struggle it is estimated that more than 50 gunmen and land grabbers were justice.
 </p>
<p>
  The fighting were mostly waged in the woods, where the peasants were able to change the correlation of the forces of the powerful weapons of the land grabbing, ambushing them in smaller numbers, beating them when they ran and hiding when they were majority. In combat, only 3 peasants were murdered, while on the side there, as already said, more than 50. The ammunition, either conquered in combat or provided by the people. Food also came from the work of the peasant people.

<p>
  Defeated by the people, the consortium then appeals to the repressive apparatus of the old state using the dread of the military to the organized people: 300 military police sent by the then governor, Jader Barbalho, go to the battlefield to "pacify" the region, ie ensuring the "rights" of the land grabbers. Now with the support of Brasilia and the State Government, the PM and the gunmen challenge a brutal repression of the peasants and their main leadership, Quintino Gatilheiro. Dozens are tortured, several murdered, women are raped, and all kinds of war crime is committed. In one of the repressive operations of which Quintino can escape, the PM kills his wife and companion, Antonia.
 </p>
<p>
  Despite the escalation of violence, the peasant self -defense remains active, demonstrating with wide popular support even after the hunt against the “bad guy”. A remarkable example of this occurs when Quintino incursions with his men at the headquarters of the municipality of Viseu and is received with a party by the population. The repercussion of the case at national level mobilizes the democratic field in favor of squatters, led by the active support of the lawyer and communist deputy Paulo Fonteles. Popular demonstrations in defense of the Posses occur in the cities of Belém and Viseu.
 </p>
<p>
  After being hunted for months by the Pará State Military Police and gunmen, Quintino is killed by rifle shots on January 4, 1985 (news reports about 70 police officers involved in the ambush). But the struggle did not stop, Quintino immediately passed from man to myth. The peasants said he turned into a dog and soon appeared to attack the tormentors! The gunmen and police, with fear, killed all the dogs they saw nearby. The people continued resisting and increasingly public opinion became favorable to the fight, forcing the government of José Sarney and the then already minister of agrarian reform Jader Barbalho, to expropriate the lands in favor of squatters!
 </p>
<p>
  A year after Quintino's death is published Decree No. 92,623 that began the expropriation of the entire area, including the minister's own family farms. Since then, to this day, amid continuous pressure from land grabbing on the lands of the Amazon, throughout the Gurupi region, Quintino follows alive in the minds and hearts of peasants that resist the landlord. The “naughty goat killer” trigger continues to fight beyond death!

<strong>
   Writing Note:
  </strong>
  Below is an article published in the Palestine Chronicle Portal, which deals with the military capabilities of the Ansarallah movement to support a war against noted American imperialism.

  The Yemeni Movement, Ansarallah Houthi, is ready to engage in a prolonged conflict with the western coalition, led by the United States, even in a scenario in which the Israeli War in Gaza Dure for years, says Russian newspaper Izvestia on Tuesday .
 </p>
<p>
  This statement was transmitted by Nasr Al-Din Amer, deputy director of the Ansarallah Department of Information, in an interview with the Russian journal.
 </p>
<p>
  For his part, Washington is aware of the sturdy Humacy military capabilities and compared the Red Sea fighting ladder with World War II
 </p>
<p>
  “In a practical way, delaying the process of ceasing fire in the Palestine conflict means that Washington will be deprived of the option of serving as a security guarantee in the region,” says Izvestia.
 </p>
<p>
  The European Union also declared the launch of its own operations to protect ships in the Red Sea.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Well -armed Yemen
 </h4>
<p>
  US Navy Vice Admiral Brad Cooper, in charge of the US Central Defense Department (Centcom), said in an interview with CBS that World War II was the last time the US Navy participated in fighting in this Navy scale and intensity.
 </p>
<p>
  The advantages of the Ansarallah military consist of the cost of projectiles and drones launched against civil and military vessels, says Murad Arefi, from the Center for Strategic Studies from Sana'a to Izvestia.
 </p>
<p>
  “The intense releases of the group cost the US a lot. The hethis has plenty of room for maneuvers, given the area of the Red Sea and the Arabic Sea. They know the terrain well and are well armed by Iran. We can say the same for intelligence data, ”says the expert.
 </p>
<p>
  According to Arefi, first, the West was betting on the loss of power of the military group, but over time, it became clear that this would not be a simple task.
 </p>
<p>
  That said, the Ansarallah movement ensured that European vessels would not be hit by projectiles and drones.
 </p>
<p>
  "We will not reach the European coalition ships if they do not make any aggressive movement against Yemen," said Nasr Al-Din Amer, but "if the EU tries to prevent us from fulfilling our tasks from helping the Gaza Strip and block ( Israel), so we will consider this an intervention in our national interests ”
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Solidarity with Gaza
 </h4>
<p>
  Ansarallah are one of the first groups of Arab resistance that declared solidarity with Gaza, opposing the genocidal war against the region.
 </p>
<p>
  The group made it clear that it has no intention of reaching any other ship other than those destined for Israel, stating that they will only stop when Israel is over war.
 </p>
<p>
  Washington responded by creating a war coalition, named prosperity guardian operation, and began launching bombing against Yemeni targets, killing and hurting many.
 </p>
<p>
  The US British Union, however, only encouraged the Yemeni position, which began attacking British and American ships in the Red Sea.

      Polish farmers blocked the motorway to Germany near the border near Frankfurt (Oder) on Sunday.
     </a>
     The farmers originally announced a four -week protest. After placement talks with Mariusz Olejniczak, the independent mayor of Słubice, only a warning strike should take place in which 500 to 700 vehicles participate. About 17,000 trucks pass the border crossing daily, the effects on traffic could extend to the outskirts of Berlin.

     This protest is only one of the many organized by Polish farmers in recent months and adds to the wave of peasant protests ranging from imperialist countries such as Germany, Spain or France to semicolonial and semi -feudal countries. The protests in Poland are directed against the agricultural policy of the European Union, particularly against the fact that Ukrainian farmers import (or export (to the EU)? Translation note) their tax -free cereals since 2022 and are sold by Little money.

     Many of the protests aim at the termination of agreements with semi -feudal and semi -colonial countries, which they classify as unfair, since the same environmental regulations do not apply to the farmers and farmers of the European Union, which leads to a price increase and a disadvantage in the competition. However, it is the European monopolis itself, especially German imperialism as a dominant power in the EU who take advantage of the war in Ukraine to enable the free traffic of the Ukrainian grain in the EU and thus prices for the grain under the pretext to reduce the "global nutritional security" because the Russian blockade of exports over the Black Sea took place at the beginning of the war.

      As reported by the revolutionary "The Red Herald" website, farmers demand that the Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk withdraw Poland from the so -called "Green New Deal", an agreement for "EU" climatic neutrality for 2050 ", which , among other things, it foresees for the significant reduction of fertilizers and crop rotation. They also requested the prohibition of Ukrainian grain in the EU.

  On February 17, Roberto de Fortini died, a great anti-fascist combatant and hero of the people. VPR militant and guerrilla articulation in the northwestern Gaucho, Fortini was directly involved in the armed struggle against the military regime.
 </p>
<p>
  Always living in a simple and reclusive way, the Italian never talked about his past, at least not to anyone who has exposed the public today. What is known to Fortini is that he comes from the region of Veneto, Italy. In testimony in 2014, said that
  <strong>
   ‘The experience I have from small where practically attacked huge columns well armed with Germans and fascists’ ’
  </strong>
  . He accompanied the Italian guerrilla leader, in operations against the fascists.
 </p>
<p>
  In the 1960s, it reappears in Passo Fundo as a street vendor. When the armed resistance against the military regime is intensified, Fontini quickly became involved with the revolutionary organizations of Passo Fundo, the VPR and the POC, quickly becoming a regional VPR leader, responsible for the regional revolutionary court and getting involved with the work of Advertising, especially among student means.
 </p>
<p>
  When Captain Carlos Lamarca deserted from the reactionary army and integrates the guerrillas, the initial idea of the VPR was that he would take refuge on the border with Argentina in the cities of Três Passos and Lieutenant Portela. Fortini was the large organizer of the guerrilla infrastructure in the region, preparing the land for the arrival of Lamarca. The plan, however, did not materialize. In 1970, reactionary intelligence investigated the ‘Pesqueira do Alto Uruguay Society Ltda.’ VPR's facade company whose Fortini was responsible for “suspected smuggling”. The justification was a lie. The reactionary military had been monitoring the supposed company for a long time.
 </p>
<p>
  In jail, Fortini was arrested with many other companions and brutally tortured. He says he was threatened to be deported back to Italy and handed over to the mafia. It was in one of these torture sessions with electric shocks that Fortini lost the ability to speak fluent Portuguese. Until the end of his life, he began to mix his tongue with Spanish and Italian.
 </p>
<p>
  Fortini was released in 1971, along with 70 other political prisoners, in exchange for the freedom of Swiss ambassador Giovanni Bucher, kidnapped by the VPR. Again, Fortini's story is obscure, and he comes to live clandestinely with his companion Nadia and his adoption son on a VPR base somewhere in missions in Argentina. Where he lived until his death, in a false name and always stating that he did not live in his home, but on a base of VPR support. On February 17, 2024, at the age of 87, his heart stopped beating, but Fortini's memory always lives, like every great fighter of the people, is immortal.

   In Lyon, as everywhere in France, the year 2023 was embers.
   <br>
   The class struggle has indeed reached several times a very high level, whether during the pension battle during which the organized working class fought with fierce and fighting spirit in June during which youth youth The most isolated proletarian has led the question of power high by directly attacking the bourgeois state, secondarily in Sainte-Soline with the intense confrontation with the repressive forces of the State around the ecological and productivist question, or with the support for the Palestinian national resistance following the history offensive of October 7.
  </br></p>
<p>
   We have said it on several occasions: nothing will ever be as before, and it is truly a "new time" that opens, the era of proletarian revolutions.
   <br>
   For this it is the duty of revolutionaries to maintain political agitation, to denounce the imperialists as soon as possible, and to participate in all the struggles of the masses, because it is the masses that make history.
  </br></p>
<p>
   In Lyon, activists from the Revolutionary Youth League (LJR) continued to seize their tasks, plunging themselves into proletarian masses and youth.
   <br>
   Thus, activists of the LJR were able to go alongside farmers on the blocking of Saint-Quentin-Fallavier.
   <br>
   It is obvious that it is essential for revolutionaries to be present where the masses are fighting, even if they are not at the origin of mobilizations as in this situation.
   <br>
   It is also obvious that all the claims brought cannot be 100% shared by the revolutionaries, but a movement cannot be changed from the outside!
   <br>
   In addition, this movement is nevertheless mainly fair and we share the demands of the peasant masses: being able to live with its work, expropriating the monopolies, put an end to the business of the food industry.

<p>
   LJR activists have also carried out numerous agitation and propaganda actions, around the farmers' struggle in addition to support for movement, but not only.
  </p>
<p>
   We have indeed been able to observe in the streets of the capital of the Gaulle many messages in tribute to Pierre Overney or to the Manouchian group.
   <br>
   New Epoque has sent several articles to these major figures of the proletariat which gave their lives for the Revolution and for the cause of the people! (

   </a>
   )
   <br/>
   By realizing the last sacrifice, these heroes of the proletariat carried the red flag of the immortal commune of Paris very high, marking a glorious page of the fight against revisionism with their blood.
   <br/>
   In addition, numerous propaganda actions in favor of the Palestinian national resistance have been carried out. Indeed, after almost 150 days of war, the resistance continues to inflict a terrible camouflet on the imperialists Yankees and its lackey, the Zionist criminal state, always showing the real fragility of the imperialists, torn between all the fronts in practice which threaten to open up during this period of rotting of imperialism. The Palestinian national resistance shows us by its heroic struggle that must be dare to fight to overcome!

  Six Military Police (PM) linked to the Assistant Executive Secretariat of Operations (Seaop) were reported on February 22 by the Public Prosecution Service after an accusation of torture against a resident of the Educandos neighborhood in Manaus. The case occurred in 2023 during an illegal approach to the PM.
 </p>
<p>
  The crime occurred on August 12, 2023, when a resident of the Educandos neighborhood was approached by the military in the distributor who owned. The police wore a white S10 and chevrolet onyx, both with cold plates, and carried rifles.
 </p>
<p>
  When they ordered the distributor's owner to let them enter the establishment, the resident said she would only do so with the arrival of her lawyer. The police, who had no court order for the operation, pulled the grid of the residence, handcuffed the resident and began an illegal magazine. During the search, they also beaten the owner of the establishment with punches, slaps and players.
 </p>
<p>
  "Even saying that I would only open the door in the presence of my lawyer, they invaded the house, assaulted me with slaps, punches and played in my head, wanting to know where my boyfriend was," she said at the time.
 </p>
<p>
  Before leaving and taking the victim to the police station, the military would also have erased the security camera circuit of the establishment.
 </p>
<p>
  The justification for the barbarity of the military was the "search for drugs and weapons." Nothing was found during the invasion. Of the military involved, a cable and a warrant officer, two were arrested after a stretch of a security camera that was recovered by the victim's family.

  We did not understand Saint Larissa well, the rest of the common mortals and the media altered the content of his speech in the memorial for the victims of Crime in Tempi.
 </div>
<div>
<br>
</br></div>
<div>
  This is told by the Press Office of the Holy Metropolis.
 </div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
  The saint wanted to oppose the "speculation" (no sacred "language") they did with the victims. Who exactly?
 </div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
  The young who for a week flooded the streets, the unions, the parties?
 </div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
  And why did the Metropolitan's (if) sacred reason also deal with those who covered the crime or at least with those who caused it?
 </div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
  We do not fall from the "sacred" clouds.
 </div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
  Such is the role of an institution that remained in history with "I slaughter me to sanctify".
 </div>
<div>
  Of the Church in this case and its leaders.
 </div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
  Always willing to serve power, to recommend silence and submission to reward eternal after death.
 </div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
  Stroumboulos and well -known Saint Larissa and surroundings did and spoke according to what the institution has done and speaks for centuries now ...
 </div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
  Serving and sanctifying the unholy human exploitation affair.
 </div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
  Synchronized characteristics and at all by accident with the representatives of the third… power who was just comforting and praying for the souls of their dead people had set up… directly to the parents of the murdered souls.
 </div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
  The disgust was ashamed of the… disgust in this case.
 </div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
  But this is the system as it tries to justify and sanctify its barbarism.
 </div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
  More nasty than the… disgust.
 </div>
<div>
<br/>

<a href="https://www.msn.com/en-xl/africa/top-stories/us-signs-deal-to-build-5-military-bases-for-somalia-army/ar-BB1ioNeo">
   On Thursday, February 15, the governments of the United States and Somalias signed an agreement,
  </a>
  In the context of the Yankee imperialism, five bases will be built for the Somali army, in particular to prepare an elite brigade, the Danab brigade. The bases are built in: Baidoa, Dhusamareb, Jowhar, Kismayo and Mogadischu, the capital of the country. According to the targets of the United States, the Brigade should include 3,000 soldiers. The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) is preceded by this agreement between Ethiopia and Somaliland,
  <a href="https://redherald.org/2024/01/05/ethiopia-makes-a-deal-for-sea-access-with-somaliland/">
   about which we have already reported
  </a>
  . This agreement gave the Ethiopian state access to the sea. Somaliland has been a state independent of Somalia for more than 30 years, which, however, is not recognized internationally as sovereign. The agreement between Ethiopia and Somaliland has shaken the region on the Horn of Africa, which was already in turmoil.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The bourgeois press mentions that the USA will build bases for the Somali army, but most likely they will also use them for its own armed promotions in the region. Several of these bases, in particular those in Kismayo and Mogadischu, agree to build a wider network of constant and temporary military base on the African continent with the plans of Yankee imperialism. This emerges from a Pentagon document
  <a href="https://mg.co.za/article/2020-05-01-exclusive-the-us-militarys-plans-to-cement-its-network-of-african-bases/">
   that came to the public in 2020
  </a>
  . The plan would include an investment of $ 330 million and it is planned that it will be carried out from 2021 to 2025. As for the Yankees military facilities in Somalia, it is known that the first plan was to prepare several temporary institutions,
  <a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/02/27/africa-us-military-bases-africom/">
   But it was soon decided that three of the bases would be "semi-permanent",
  </a>
  i.e. a higher level of importance than expected, these were concrete the bases of: Baledogle, Kismayo and Mogadischu. Yankee imperialism recently suffered its own direct losses when two members of the Navy Seals disappeared on the coast of Somalia on January 11th and on January 22nd too
  <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/01/21/1225980951/2-navy-seals-who-went-missing-off-somalias-coast-are-dead-the-u-s-military-says">
   Fallen in battle were explained
  </a>
  after they continued to be missing.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The military presence of the Yankees on the Horn of Africa has increased over the years, not only through the network of military base points across Africa, but also through specific efforts in this area. After deducting the Yankees from Somalia under
  <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-61631439">
   Trumps
  </a>
  The presidency was again stationed hundreds of Yankee troops in Somalia under the presidency of Joe Biden. Yankee imperialism is involved in dark crimes against the Somali people, as it turned out soon after the stationing again when the already mentioned Danab-Brigade and other militias trained and equipped by Yankee imperialism
  <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/5dg7wn/puntland-security-force-somalia-cia">
   on the massacre of the Zivilist
  </a>
  and were involved in other crimes against the Somali people.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  With regard to the military presence of the Yankees, this is not limited to their direct presence, but their lackeys are also militarily present. For example, the United Arab Emirates, which maintain a strong presence in the region of Africa horn, including Somalia, where the Emiratic troops were indeed involved in operations against al-Shabab and several of their units together with troops from other countries that are subject to Yankee imperialism, were eliminated,
  <a href="https://redherald.org/2024/02/12/somalia-four-uae-soldiers-and-a-bahraini-officer-killed-in-an-attack/">
   As we reported
  </a>
  . Other lackeys of Yankee imperialism also plan to get involved directly in the region, such as the old Turkish state, the recently
  <a href="https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/02/turkey-somalia-sign-defense-deal-wake-ethiopia-somaliland-agreement">
   signed a defense agreement with Somalia
  </a>
  And as the main reason for this, the cooperation in the fight against terrorism. In addition, another Lakai, the Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, has
  <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/21/egypt-backs-somalia-in-dispute-over-ethiopia-somaliland-deal">
   quickly his support for Somalia
  </a>
  In a dispute with Ethiopia, expressed around the Mou and explains that Ethiopia wants to tear Somalisches Land itself. The Egyptian president has been hypocritical on the "fraternity" between the Arab peoples and declared that Egypt is ready to "provide support against one of the Arab countries in the event of aggression, especially if fraternal countries ask us to stand up to them". This determination was not available to defend other Arabic brothers, such as the Palestinian people who are exposed to the genocide committed by the state of Israel.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Yankee imperialism continues its plans to subjugate the oppressed African nations, in this case Somalias, and accelerates this process in a moment of unrest on the horn of Africa and in the Middle East, because Somalia due to its proximity to the Middle East and its access situation Red Sea plays a key role. In addition, the struggle of the Somali people and the Arab peoples is a challenge that Yankee imperialism wants to transform into blood and fire, as he has been doing in this region for years. This agreement will strengthen the military presence of the Yankees in the region, but as the Arab peoples have shown several times, in particular the Palestinian people and the Somali people, a greater military presence and repression are not sufficient to the will to fight and resistance of the oppressed peoples to bend.

  One day after the demonstration called by Jair Bolsonaro, the repercussion in the press monopoly and communication confirms the analyzes of
  <strong>
   AND
  </strong>
  exposed in the program
  <strong>
   By the way
  </strong>
  As for the unquired objectives of Bolsonaro. The number of people, even politically relevant, was not able to prevent PF investigations from continuing. On the contrary, Bolsonaro's backward speech will be included in the PF's inquiry against Bolsonaro and other bigwigs. However, all analyzes culminate, in the end, to pass the armed forces - scammers ever since.
 </p>
<p>
  In Reinaldo Azevedo's “O É do Thing” program, the obvious was found: Bolsonaro admitted his scammers preparations. However, the writer stated that what prevented the culmination of the coup d'état was the non -adherence of military. It must be clear that Reinaldo's statement expresses very well the position of the liberal and reactionary right: commitment to the military. The alleged “objective analysis” is replaced by amnesia: forgetting that, before Bolsonaro ascended to the presidency, it was the high military officers
  <strong>
   active
  </strong>
  who propelled the intervention of the Armed Forces in political matters and interfering with political decisions through blackmail and dissuasion. Reinaldo, also seems to have forgotten that while discussions about the need for military intervention were running loose in the barracks in 2022, the “legalists” of the Armed Forces participated in it and shut up in the initiative. They only said "no" to Bolsonaro at the end of the year after the election, prizes by orders from the US State Department, which no longer wants disorders in Latin America, its backyard. Reinaldo Azevedo is the typical reactionary “defender of democracy”: he knows that generals are supporters of the scammer theses and only disagree with Bolsonaro as to
  <em>
   method
  </em>
  and to
  <em>
   time
  </em>
  ; Therefore, Azevedo does not want to face them and denounce them, for fear of rooting them. Azevedo prefers to deliver the wallet to the thief so as not to irritate him and avoid the robbery.
 </p>
<p>
  Already the journalist Vera Magalhães, found that "Bolsonaro explained his desire to articulate amnesty to those who committed some coup action." The communication monopoly journalist “O Globo” said that in addition to a demonstration of political support to her figure, Jair Bolsonaro used the demonstration to explain “one or more bills proposing amnesty for those who have practiced some coup action in recent years”, Encouraging a broader amnesty project that includes itself and also its most immediate political allies, such as Valdemar Costa Neto (the president of the PL). For Vera Magalhães, the articulation has no chance to avenge due to the lack of interest on the part of Arthur Lira and Rodrigo Pacheco, presidents of the Chamber of Deputies and the Federal Senate. The press monopoly journalist also states that Bolsonaro had a "success" in bringing to Paulista a large number of supporters, but could not achieve his goal of "pressing the judiciary and the legislature", and also admitted that he had knowledge of the "draft of the coup".
 </p>
<p>
  Ricardo Corrêa, from “Estadão”, also states that Bolsonaro offered “White Flag” in exchange for amnesty and that continues to conduct the opposition: “Even in the strings, it is the former president who continues to conduct any opposition, which was seen with the Main names in the 2026 race kissing his hand in the face of the arrival of his worst moment. ” To Veja, an anonymous ally of Bolsonaro said that "the multitude [present on Paulista Avenue] here is proof that pockets are more alive than ever, and this will surely help us in this year's elections."
 </p>
<p>
  In fact, about the number of people present, USP researchers estimated 185,000 people. In contrast to the figures presented by the Public Security Bureau of SP (which is from the scope of the pocketist Tarcísio de Freitas), the political debate monitor in the digital environment, linked to the University of São Paulo, estimated a number well below the 750,000 announced . Researchers calculation is based on the point to point network method (known as P2PNet). It is an algorithm that identifies the number of heads in aerial photos taken by drones. The number is still relevant, but it is well below what is being disclosed by the far right.
 </p>
<p>
  It was also revealed that Michel Temer met with Bolsonaro to advise him to step on the brake. Michel Temer was sought by STF ministers, who were concerned about what Bolsonaro could talk about at the time of February 25. “If the speech is provocative, the court will have no other way other than prison. How could he trust the Lord, could you look for a conversation? ”Asked a magistrate to Temer. At the meeting with Bolsonaro, Michel Temer said the following to Bolsonaro, according to Veja: “Bolsonaro, let me tell you: you have the STF against you, have the press against you and have half the population against you. Make an act preaching the pacification, preaching a rubber in everything. If you assault the Supreme, you will be arrested the next day. I'm sure of that. ” Apparently, Bolsonaro answered the
  <em>
   order
  </em>
  .
 </p>
<p>
  Press monopolies analyzes focus only on one of the scammer forces, Jair Bolsonaro, and ignore that Armed Forces's coup continues. The analyzes impacted in the press monopoly ignore the main factor responsible for scammer plans to have taken a huge dimension, being discussed repeatedly in meetings that were attended by ministers, politicians, allies of the president and reserve generals.
 </p>
<p>
  By ignoring that very important generals of active and reserve were involved to the neck in recent coup moves, the main vehicles of the monopolistic press seeks to leave the role of the armed forces in the country's history.
 </p>
<p>
  Both analyzes ignore, for example, that Bolsonaro met with the Ativa General, a member of the High Command and responsible for land operations, General Estevam Theophilo Gaspar de Oliveira, and that this
  <strong>
   agreed to use your troops
  </strong>
  If Bolsonaro signed the decree.
 </p>
<p>
  They ignore, for example, that Navy Commander Almir Garnier has made his troops available to the then coup president if he ordered it. They also ignore that Army Commander Freire Gomes himself participated in numerous meetings with the scammented scammers, received all the information from the preparations, the legal arguments and did nothing. By contemporary with the entire articulation, he adopted a convenient position to “wait to see what he will give”; Only at the last minute did the negative position be adopted for the institutional rupture.
 </p>
<p>
  That is, all the serious tension of the military crisis was based on the fact that
  <strong>
   There was a huge possibility of the Armed Forces, their high active officers, to unite in the extremist position of giving a coup d'état
  </strong>
  . There was no military crisis and scam risk if it were not for the army's coup character (in which legalists are also scammers, but only differ from others because he believes “not time”). The writer totally ignore this.
 </p>
<p>
  The FA have been scammers ever. They retain in their conception, in their mindset, and in their routine operations the protection of the country's political institutions. They feel responsible for preventing Brazil from “communism” and are entitled to determine when and how to intervene.
 </p>
<p>
  All of this, after all, reveals not only the hypocrisy of these newspaper newspaper of the communication of Brazil that blatantly supported the military coup of 1964, but its real interests in the defense of this old order.

  No we will not be stuck!
 </p>
<p>
  We don't want to be stuck!
 </p>
<p>
  We must not be stuck!
 </p>
<p>
  It is the system and its attack that does not let us forget, we do not let us live, it does not let us go!

<p>
  Get up in the morning to go to your field and know that you will be able to live!
 </p>
<p>
  Get up in the morning and go to school, school and dream!
 </p>
<p>
  That is normal! The obvious!
 </p>
<p>
  And yet! If you go on an excursion, if you go to your parents for holidays, if you get on a train to go to find friends and girlfriends, in the 21st century Greece they will kill you along the way!
 </p>
<p>
  Therefore; What is the prospect of this system?
 </p>
<p>
  The challenge of the self -evident !!!!
 </p>
<p>
  This perspective doesn't make us! We want our own perspective! We want the obvious and even more and we will not be stuck!
 </p>
<p>
  We will go out and shout it, as students and peasants do! As the peoples of all over the world do!
 </p>
<p>
  On February 28, 1 year after the state murder in Tempi, to go to the streets and say we don't forget! To take to the streets and fight, for the lost brothers, to fight because we are right and we will win, to fight for the self -evident work, education, health!

<p>
  The dependent and unmistakable bourgeoisie of Greece, the country and the people with the immediate involvement of the plans and wars of the US-NATO, leads to a dangerous course.
 </p>
<p>
  While the people of Ukraine watered the West -Russia confrontation with their blood and the nuclear trap is trampled on over Europe •
 </p>
<p>
  At a time when the people of Palestine are bombardedly bombarded, giving tens of thousands of dead by the fascist-Zionist state of Israel with the protection of the US-EU and is in danger of a new mass displacement from its land •
 </p>
<p>
  The ND government, with the support of PASOK, SYRIZA and fascist parties, is ginging that the murderers of the US peoples consider it the most obedient "child" and assigns the roles of direct participation in their war plans. The "congratulations" of US officials on the remarkable of the country's armed forces are a forerunner to make the statements of ministers to make, "we will give our blood again for the allies", meaning the blood of the children of the people of course!
 </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
  This submission and the unmistakable adventurism of the entire bourgeoisie to "satisfy" its baby -fillingness leads:
 </p>
<p>
  • In the department of frigate for participation in US-M war operations. Britain in the Red Sea, against Yemen.
 </p>
<p>
  • Participating in the business with the nickname ASPIDES of EE, even undertaking the management of the business.
 </p>
<p>
  • The concession of any territory, air and sea for military bases, war or other US -NATO operations and the mission of forces where requested.
 </p>
<p>
<span>
<span style="white-space: pre;">
</span>
   The bourgeoisie of the country and its governments over time have every reason to pursue this policy, as they have ascended to power with the support, and with the weapons of the foreign factor.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
  But our people should not forget the younger generation to find out what they have paid for when it was called to become "meat" for the canons of the imperialists.
 </p>
<p>
<b>
<u>
    1919:
   </u>
</b>
  At the beginning of the year, the Greek army's participation in Ukraine, in the war declared France, England, the US against the newly established state of workers and the people, the Soviet Union, begins. It had preceded, in November 1918, a telegram of El. Venizelos to the Greek Ambassador to Paris "please declare Prime Minister and Foreign Ministry that the Greek Army is at their disposal and may be used by a common struggle, where his mission is considered necessary." 23,351 men were sent to Ukraine, killed 1055 (others talking about 1300), and many joined the Red Army lines. Apocalyptic of the kind of operation is that they forced the Greek soldiers to turn against the French sailors who had been revolted and did not want to fight against the people of the Soviet Union. The imperialists were defeated and the Greek army returned in the spring of 1919.
 </p>
<p>
<b>
<u>
    1919-1922:
   </u>
</b>
  The imperialists, mainly the English, encouraging the Modern Moderate and the Great Rebellion of the bourgeoisie, for their own interests against the Ottoman Empire, pushing it into the campaign in Asia Minor with the painful results for the Greeks. Over 1,500,000 refugees, about 25,000 dead soldiers, an unknown number of missing soldiers and Greeks in Asia Minor.
  <b>
   The war ended whenever they wanted the terms imposed by the imperialists!
  </b>
</p>
<p>
<b>
<u>
    1950-1955:
   </u>
</b>
  The bourgeoisie has grabbed power with the weapons of Scobby and Napalm bombs in the US. It holds thousands in the dry, others imprison and exterminates and the people as a whole are narrowing under poverty and state violence. So he is eagerly seeking the support of the West (to join NATO) and sends, as credentials, an expeditionary body in distant Korea in the war declared by the US and their allies against communism! A total of 10,255 men were sent in succession and an aviation flock. 186, 577 were injured and destroyed 4 C-47 aircraft in a war that has been described as "the forgotten war"!
 </p>
<p>
<b>
<u>
    1974:
   </u>
</b>
  The military junta of Greece is encouraged by the US and overturns Makarios, the President of the Republic of Cyprus, thereby giving Turkey's bourgeoisie to intervene in Cyprus and occupy the northern part of it in 1974.
 </p>
<p>
<b>
   1991
  </b>
  US invasion into Iraq,
  <b>
   1999
  </b>
  NATO bombings against Belgrade and Yugoslavia,
  <b>
   2001
  </b>
  NATO attack in Afghanistan,
  <b>
   2003
  </b>
  invasion of the US and their allies in Iraq,
  <b>
   2011
  </b>
  NATO raid in Libya.
  <b>
   2022
  </b>
  Ukraine becomes a field of confrontation between Russia -West. In all these imperialist operations, the US -based bases in the country and especially in Souda and Akrotiri Chania, as well as the whole country offered to serve the war plans of the imperialists. Military forces are included in NATO and participate in operations.
 </p>
<p>
  Today, when the US -Russia and China exacerbation of competitions are generating new warships with destruction of countries, throwing up refugees and the deaths of thousands of oppressed, at the same time as threats to nuclear dwelling, it is imperative. Our people to go on the way of the struggle, to strengthen the anti-war-anti-imperialist movement and
  <b>
   to demand:
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  No involvement of the country in the wars and plans of the imperialists. Do not leave the frigates for the Red Sea! No involvement of the country in the slaughter of the Palestinian people. To demand, in mind that only a mass decisive movement can be effective.
 </p>
<p>
  The anti -war -anti -imperialist struggle to "paint" the struggles for bread - Diakia, Freedom Studies. The forces that really refer to the Left, the story has shown that they are judged by their contribution to these struggles and not to election rates.

  As we already mentioned in our previous article, Egypt continues
  <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68375460">
   the construction of a concentration camp for Palestinian
  </a>
  s near the Rafah border. Already 3 km of concrete walls have been built, and another 16 square kilometers of land have been cleared to continue the work. For the moment Egypt still denies that it is a camp for displaced Palestinians, and claims that it is a “logistics center” for aid.
 </p>
<p>
  Meanwhile, so-called “human rights” associations continue to accuse Israel of
  <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/human-rights-watch-accuses-israel-of-blocking-aid-to-gaza/ar-BB1iUwiB">
   blocking the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza
  </a>
  . Although in the International Court of Justice trial, one of the clear orders was that Israel should allow humanitarian aid to enter, it has even
  <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/human-rights-watch-accuses-israel-of-blocking-aid-to-gaza/ar-BB1iUwiB">
   prevented the entry of up to 30% more humanitarian aid,
  </a>
  according to the UN office.

<p>
  Meanwhile, Netanyahu continues to threaten

  </a>
  ” to attack Rafah with even more power, in order to achieve “total victory” over Hamas. With the death toll close to 30,000 only from direct Israeli attacks in the Gaza-Strip, with two-thirds of the city’s hospitals out of operation, and the rest at rock bottom, and a population with increasingly severe signs of starvation, Netanyahu continues his threats to wipe out Hamas. However, as the media reports, there has only been one senior leader killed by Israeli forces in Beirut, by a drone, and US officials claim that
  <a href="https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/israel-at-war/1706422691-80-of-hamas-tunnel-system-remains-intact-report">

  . Proving that Israel’s war is not against Hamas, but against the people in resistance.

<p>
  Meanwhile, the solidarity actions continue worldwide:
 </p>
<p>
  In
  <a href="https://en.abna24.com/story/1439898">
   Sanaa
  </a>
  , the capital of Yemen, there has been a large demonstration with thousands of people. In a note from the march, it was said: “We call on the Arab and Islamic nations and freedom-seeking peoples of the world to take immediate action to stop the Zionist regime’s attack on Rafah, which is taking place with the full support of the West and the United States”. It also added that most countries and governments, “are not just bystanders, some of them even cooperate with the Israeli enemy and secretly support the genocidal acts of the Zionist regime.”

 </p>
<p>
  February 24, 2024
 </p>
<p>
  The Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) condemns the US-Marcos fascist regime, the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and the Philippine National Police (PNP) for the massacre of five captured revolutionaries in Bilar, Bohol yesterday, and joins the demand for justice for Domingo Compoc, Hannah Cesista, Parlito Historia, Marlon Omosura and Alberto Sancho.
 </p>
<p>
  The five were all captured alive and taken into custody yesterday morning by the fascist criminal troops of the 47th Infantry Battalion and Bohol police in Sitio Matin-ao 2, Barangay Campagao, Bilar, Bohol. They were subjected to severe torture and consequently murdered in cold blood.
 </p>
<p>
  There is no truth to the lie being circulated by the police that the five were killed in an encounter. Local residents attest that no encounter took place that morning. What people witnessed was the brutality of the military and police combat troops, torturing and killing the five revolutionaries.
 </p>
<p>
  A picture surreptitiously taken shows Compoc, with arms apparently bound behind his back, under custody of a soldier of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) after being accosted by the military and police. This image is presently circulating among the people of Bohol and on social media.
 </p>
<p>
  Compoc, who was in his 60s, was suffering from arthritis and was in no position to fight. He was subjected to severe torture in front of a number of people in the village in the hope of striking fear among them. Based on facts initially gathered in the area, Ka Silong was hacked to death, suffering fatal wounds on his neck and abdomen.
 </p>
<p>
  Cesista, on the other hand, a young lawyer from Cebu, who chose to serve the peasant masses and their revolutionary movement in Bohol, was thrown to the ground by the soldiers and made to lie and crawl on the mud, before she was eventually shot to death.
 </p>
<p>
  The willful killing of Compoc, Casista, Historia, Omosura and Sancho after being captured and placed under the custody of the military and police consists of gross violations of international humanitarian law. The 47th IB and Bohol police, the leadership of the AFP and PNP, and Marcos himself, are liable for war crimes and must be prosecuted and punished for their nefarious deeds.
 </p>
<p>
  Further details are being gathered how the others were similarly tortured and killed. A post-mortem autopsy of the remains of the victims of the Bohol massacre conducted by independent pathologists will surely add more details to the initial facts bravely put forward by the community, and help unravel completely the gruesome crime committed by the military and police.
 </p>
<p>
  Initial details provided by local witnesses contradict the “findings” of the so-called “scene of the crime” unit of the Philippine National Police, who are in collusion with the police and military criminals in brazenly covering up the crime.
 </p>
<p>
  The Party calls on the Filipino people, peasant associations, workers unions, youth groups, lawyers, the media, church people, women and others to unite and stand with the families, friends and loved ones of the victims of the Bohol Massacre in their demand for justice. The Party and the New People’s Army will vow to do all it can to punish the fascist and terrorist criminals.
 </p>
<p>
  The Bohol massacre is just the latest of the string of fascist crimes that are being perpetrated by the AFP and PNP in the course of its desperate campaign to put an end the Filipino people’s armed resistance. The 47th IB, in particular, is also responsible for the killing of Manuel “Loloy” Tinio on April 4, 2023 in Ubay, Bohol, and Arthur Jasper Lucenario on May 14, 2023 in San Miguel, Bohol.
  <br>
<br>
  In perpetrating these fascist crimes, the Marcos regime and the AFP is only succeeding in further inciting the Filipino people to take up arms and join the New People’s Army to fight for their rights and advance their cause for social justice. By employing state terrorism, the US-Marcos regime is showing why the people’s revolutionary armed resistance is just and necessary, and why it is the only option for the people, especially, the peasant masses in their struggle for genuine land reform.
 </br></br></p>
<p>
  The people and the majority of peasant masses of Bohol, in particular, are left with no option but to rise up in resistance and fight back with arms. In Bohol, land remains in the hands of a few big landlords, big bourgeois compradors and foreign big corporations. Majority of the peasants are tenants and oppressed suffering gross forms of exploitation and economic hardship and hunger. They are being dispossessed of their land by big oil palm plantations and eco-tourism projects.
 </p>
<p>
  The Communist Party of the Philippines and the revolutionary movement pays the highest tribute to Domingo Compoc, Hannah Cesista, Parlito Historia, Marlon Omosura and Alberto Sancho. They are heroes of the Filipino people who gave up all comforts to serve the downtrodden and oppressed masses. Their contributions to the Filipino people’s cause will never be forgotten.
 </p>

  Inspired by the heroism of Francisco Dagohoy, who led Bohol’s resistance for more than eight decades from 1744 to 1829 against Spanish colonial forces, the peasant masses of Bohol, together with the rest of the oppressed and exploited masses of the Filipino people, under the leadership of the Party, are determined to rise up and fight with arms, however long it takes, to advance the struggle for national democracy towards complete victory.

<p>
  This year’s February 24 the all-out war of aggression against Ukraine by Russian imperialism marks its second anniversary. This unjust war have generated hundreds of thousands of dead and wounded and millions of displaced, caused misery and pain for the whole Ukrainian people.
 </p>
<p>
  Through the heroic defense of their homeland by the people of Ukraine, in spite of the national traitorous regime headed by the Yankee lackey Zelensky, the Russian aggressor until now have not been able to fulfill its maximum war aims.
 </p>
<p>
  It is just and correct to reaffirm what the International Communist League issued one year ago:
  <em>
   “The main contradiction is that between Ukraine, a country oppressed by imperialism, and Russia, an imperialist country. Regardless of the class character of the Ukrainian regime and its service to the interests of other imperialist powers, mainly the Yankee superpower, any confusion on this point leads to deny the Ukraine its right to independence and national sovereignty, and hence, to, at least indirectly, support the interests of Russian imperialism.”
  </em>
  as well as
  <em>
   “The long term plan of the Yankees to encircle and ultimately defeat its only nuclear equivalent and the Russian counter measures to retake lost positions, is the key factor leading up to the war.”
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  It is particularly noteworthy that it has also been proven correct what was written then:
  <em>
   “The Zelensky regime stands in acute contradiction to the interests of the overwhelming majority of the Ukrainian People, trafficking with their justified patriotic feelings, applies absolute centralism and there are no democratic rights what so ever for the People. The rights of opinion, assembly and organization is suppressed by draconian and chauvinist repression and the regime relies on open Fascist military formations to smash every expression of popular discontent. It sabotages the independent armed resistance of the People by relying on the weapons, eagerly given by the Yankee led NATO, fearing the armed People who are the only one who really defends the Nation.”
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  This is an important fact. Because today it is clear and obvious that the main point why the Zelensky regime is unable to defeat the Russian imperialist aggression – despite all the heroic sacrifices of the Ukrainian people – is because these country-selling traitors rely on imperialism, mainly Yankee, and not on the people.
 </p>
<p>
  This is expressed among many other different things in the case of the fall of Avdiivka, a small town in the Donetsk region. A bitter tragedy as such wars write them.
  <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/19/europe/ukrainian-avdiivka-soldiers-messages-intl/index.html">
   As media reported
  </a>
  , Soldiers stationed there made desperate attempts to escape the ruins of the town. One of them wrote:
  <em>
   “It was just about survival. The road to Avdiivka is filled with Ukrainian corpses.”
  </em>
  A commander informed over the radio that the wounded would not be evacuated. The men were left behind to be executed by the Russian invaders. This way the Ukrainian armed forces made the decision to abandon the town, handing Russia its most significant victory since it captured the city of Bakhmut last year.
  <em>
   “The ability to save our people is the most important task for us,”
  </em>
  Zelensky said utmost cynically at the Munich Security Conference. The New York Times analyzed:
  <em>
   “Russia’s capture of Avdiivka is a strategic and symbolic blow to Ukraine’s military. Avdiivka was a stronghold of Ukrainian defenses in the Donetsk region, protecting several key Ukrainian military positions farther west and putting the nearby Russian-controlled city of Donetsk under constant threat.”
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  We can see that the current tendency is that Russian imperialism is on its way of accomplishing slowly its minimum war aims. Maps published by the bbc show this clearly:

  Also internally Russian imperialism is making advances. The new head of the Wagner mercenaries, Anton Yelizarov, lately stated on the restructuring of the organization: “We are building a camp, so that the new units that will be formed – which will become part of the volunteer corps of the Russia’s National Guard (Rosgvardiya) – can arrive and settle.” This so-called “Cossack Camp” would “almost certainly” be based in Russia’s southern city of Rostov,
  <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/feb/07/russia-ukraine-war-live-explosions-in-kyiv-and-other-cities-amid-mass-russian-missile-strikes">
   as The Guardian reports.
  </a>
  This development finally buries all the speculations and western dreams of a military coup against Putin. Also the death of Navalny serves in this sense, as does the courts ruling that Boris Nadezhdin is denied to participate in the upcoming elections scheduled for March 15 to 17 or the liquidation of a deserter pilot in Spain.
 </p>
<p>
  It is not only militarily that Russian imperialism is gaining grounds. Economically,
  <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/19/europe/russia-oil-india-shadow-fleet-cmd-intl/index.html">
   as CNN reports
  </a>
  , Russia is entering its third year of war in Ukraine with an unprecedented amount of cash in government coffers, bolstered by a record $37 billion of crude oil sales to India in 2023. Hence, India increasing its purchases of Russian crude oil by over 13 times of its pre-war amounts, a trade not subject to sanctions and since entirely legal. Russia’s federal revenues ballooned to a record of $320 billion in 2023 and are set to rise further still. Roughly a third of the money is spent on the war in Ukraine.
 </p>
<p>
  Also in international politics Russian imperialism still is a force to calculate with, as it is shown by the latest proposal for a meeting of all the Palestinian factions in Moscow in order to create a somehow national unity, especially between the two largest factions the Fatah and the Hamas,
  <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/middleeast/live-news/israel-hamas-war-gaza-news-02-18-24/h_d7fe8b0d1648652842b5f5daa65928c1">
   as CNN reported
  </a>
  on February 18.
 </p>
<p>
  Under these impressions it is necessary to reaffirm the tasks ahead, set by the ICL in February last year:
  <em>
   “We must also do everything we can to promote the friendship of the Ukrainian and Russian Peoples. Two Peoples who once were united as one in the great Soviet Union under the red banner with the hammer and sickle of Lenin and Stalin now are driven against each other on the battle field due to the intrigues of the imperialist. The communist in formation, the revolutionaries and all consequent anti-imperialists, have a particular responsibility to increase the propaganda against the imperialist war of Russia, raising their struggle to new heights against the imperialist State and its war of aggression, by all means at their disposal, also struggling against imperialist war mongering and weapon sending in the respective imperialist countries.”

   The call for innumerable organizations with the slogan “The food emergency cannot wait any longer. Enough adjustment ”, had as a center the food claim for popular dining rooms, update of the amount of plans, increased retirement and the minimum vital and mobile salary, the delivery of school kits.
  </p>
<p>
   Thousands and thousands throughout the country expressed, in unity, the repudiation of social adjustment and exclusion policies.
  </p>
<p>
   The brutal devaluation that the National Government executed, added to the high inflationary indices, the tariffs and the cut to food assistance to dining rooms and picnings, has led the Argentine people to extreme poverty and favoring a handful of monopolies and landowners.
  </p>
<p>
   In a country that produces food for millions, there are 27 million poor with almost 7 million homeless people who do not have for daily food, which increases with each measure against the people that the reactionary government takes, hunger and delivery of Milei.
  </p>
<p>
   The mobilizations and cuts developed in all provinces: Jujuy, Salta, Tucumán, Córdoba, Misiones, Chaco, Formosa, Corrientes, Entre Ríos, Santa Fe, Buenos Aires, Mendoza, San Juan, San Luis, La Rioja, La Pampa, Neuquén, Río Negro, Chubut, Tierra del Fuego.
  </p>
<p>
   In
   <strong>
    CABA
   </strong>
   The mobilization of the set of organizations that make up the UTEP, the piquetera unit, workers and various organizations and movements marched to the Ministry of Human Capital claiming answers to the enormous needs of our people because hunger does not expect. The broad police operation to apply the Bullrich protocol I cannot prevent the massive mobilization.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
    "A gigantic step to face Milei's policy"
    <em>
</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
   In radio statements of that day
   <strong>
    Juan Carlos Alderete
   </strong>
   , coordinator of the unemployed and precarious movement of the CCC, spoke of the day as a gigantic step to face Milei's policy.
  </p>
<p>
   “Today is a very giant step forward of popular forces, social organizations. I remember that of 2001 where we had achieved this unit with all those who claimed at that time. And that unit has also made possible the unit with the middle class and that is why on January 27, 2001, “Picket and saucepan was born, the fight is only one”.
  </p>
<p>
   “This gigantic step will serve to face Javier Milei's policy, which has been more than 60 days. Milei and his henchmen are demonstrating that they are looters, that they want to take everything in the shortest possible time. We know the level of inflation and poverty that we have, and they publicly say the macabre plan that they intend to lower inflation based on demolishing everything, salaries, retirement and thus seek to liquidate consumption. That is called recession that we have already lived in 2001 and other crises but this is fierce. ”
  </p>
<p>
   In relation to hunger and the dining rooms Alderete said that “in several provinces, I live in La Matanza, in what is Virrey del Pino, González Catán, there are already dining rooms with the poster ´ there are no food 'because logically what we receive from donations Of the merchants and entrepreneurs in the area, who have been doing it for a long time, it is not enough. A huge sadness. The level of perversity of what the government does with people is incredible. And in those liar stories in which they talk about intermediation, food arrives directly to the dining rooms. We are asking to deliver food to the dining rooms, not a social leader, to continue feeding, people are desperate. The government believes it is an Excel payroll, don't you see what is happening? In that Excel form there are people who are suffering a lot. They will close the accounts but people cannot live like this. ”
  </p>
<p>
   “The government celebrates because they lowered the deficit, we would have to celebrate that we arrived at the end of the month without feeding our children, without paying the light, the gas and without being able to send the boys to school. Let's face that. If time continues, they will leave a devastated country, without SMEs, without shops because the purchasing power has dropped so much that consumption will go down greatly. It is like in 2001: if they shout me too, if they come to hit me I am going to defend myself. Our country is at stake here. To Milei, who makes the madman, I want him to go wrong, because if he is doing well, he is a business policy that he has, it is not a government policy, it is a business plan that he does with the macro business caste that is in the government and that occupy important positions. The Minister of Economy is the one who borrowed us together with Macri and entire generations that have to pay the debt to the IMF, is a criminal because it allowed the capital escape of our country. What caste do they talk about? Casta turns out that they are the workers and the most down. ”
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
    Voices from the cuts in the country
   </strong>
</p>
<p>
   From the cut in La Plata
   <strong>
    Ramiro joked,
   </strong>
   leader of the CCC, stated that “this day is part of the 500 route cuts throughout the country. It is to tell Patricia Bullrich that the antipiquete protocol will put it where it does not give him the light. And it shows the path we need because they want to make us believe that there is no money in the country. But here the 20 companies that produce 85% of food, financial capital, oil companies, landowners and the IMF remain the big beneficiaries of millions that are having a very bad time. In two months there are 3,200,000 new poor ones, they are numbers but in the day to day We have been able to buy neither the backpack nor the shoes. ”
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   From one of the cuts in Rosario
   <strong>
    Eduardo Delmonte
   </strong>
   From the CCC declared that “this government was wanting to intimidate us with fear and getting into our homes to suffer in silence to those of social organizations. However, in a process the courage was more important that made us want to prevent our children from hungry and diseases to fear that they wanted to impose, and expresses itself here. This government came to destroy Argentina, not only impose hunger but to deliver the country. ” And he said that “we are touring a path together that does not have to be just this, it has to also be to support the light on the cacerolazos and multisectoral that allow us to make the framework of neighborhood unit per neighborhood, factory by factory, place I work, because that is ultimately unstoppable. ” He then referred to the struggles of December 20, of the cacerolazos when the DNU and the historic unemployment of January 24 were announced that told him outside the adjuster project of the Omnibus law and said that “with these cuts we show that it is possible to defend the democratic freedoms, which is possible to fight and that there will be no protocol that intimidates us. ”

   Massive strikes and workers, peasants, women and young people, from natives, culture and science workers, and other popular sectors, travel the country, face the brutal adjustment, the delivery of national sovereignty and repression, taxes, taxes by the reactionary government of Milei.
  </p>
<p>
   Faced with the growth of the struggles and their failure in the Milei Congress, it launched a fierce campaign of insults, pressures, blackmail and squeezes, "against the traitors" that are not subordinated.
  </p>
<p>
   Defending the "model" of the landowner oligarchy that threw butter into the roof and drove the country to blood and fire, now the "libertarians" launched an offensive against the provinces, reissued the confrontation between "unit and federal", stealing the funds they must be distributed between Nation and the provinces.
  </p>
<p>
   Faced with Milei's offensive, the solidarity of most governors advanced.
  </p>
<p>
   We start from the needs and claims of the working class and the people. We sympathized with the struggle of the Chubutense people, as expressed on February 23 in the massive act of the labor, social, popular movement, of which we were part.
  </p>
<p>
   We fight the unity for the struggles to advance, today with the aim of twisting the arm to the policy of Milei recovering the federal character of the funds collected and we continue to lead the struggles to end hunger, unemployment, the delivery of national sovereignty and repression of popular struggles.
  </p>
<p>
   We work for the unity of all democratic, popular and national forces accumulating forces to conquer an exit in favor of the people.
