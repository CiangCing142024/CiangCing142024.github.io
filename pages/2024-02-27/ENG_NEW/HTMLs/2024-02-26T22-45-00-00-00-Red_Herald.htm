  As we already mentioned in our previous article, Egypt continues
  <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68375460">
   the construction of a concentration camp for Palestinian
  </a>
  s near the Rafah border. Already 3 km of concrete walls have been built, and another 16 square kilometers of land have been cleared to continue the work. For the moment Egypt still denies that it is a camp for displaced Palestinians, and claims that it is a “logistics center” for aid.
 </p>
 <p>
  Meanwhile, so-called “human rights” associations continue to accuse Israel of
  <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/human-rights-watch-accuses-israel-of-blocking-aid-to-gaza/ar-BB1iUwiB">
   blocking the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza
  </a>
  . Although in the International Court of Justice trial, one of the clear orders was that Israel should allow humanitarian aid to enter, it has even
  <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/human-rights-watch-accuses-israel-of-blocking-aid-to-gaza/ar-BB1iUwiB">
   prevented the entry of up to 30% more humanitarian aid,
  </a>
  according to the UN office.

  </a>
  ” to attack Rafah with even more power, in order to achieve “total victory” over Hamas. With the death toll close to 30,000 only from direct Israeli attacks in the Gaza-Strip, with two-thirds of the city’s hospitals out of operation, and the rest at rock bottom, and a population with increasingly severe signs of starvation, Netanyahu continues his threats to wipe out Hamas. However, as the media reports, there has only been one senior leader killed by Israeli forces in Beirut, by a drone, and US officials claim that
  <a href="https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/israel-at-war/1706422691-80-of-hamas-tunnel-system-remains-intact-report">
   80% of the tunnels used by the Palestinian National Resistance Front remain intact

  . Proving that Israel’s war is not against Hamas, but against the people in resistance.

  Meanwhile, the solidarity actions continue worldwide:

 <p>
  In
  <a href="https://en.abna24.com/story/1439898">
   Sanaa
  </a>
  , the capital of Yemen, there has been a large demonstration with thousands of people. In a note from the march, it was said: “We call on the Arab and Islamic nations and freedom-seeking peoples of the world to take immediate action to stop the Zionist regime’s attack on Rafah, which is taking place with the full support of the West and the United States”. It also added that most countries and governments, “are not just bystanders, some of them even cooperate with the Israeli enemy and secretly support the genocidal acts of the Zionist regime.”
