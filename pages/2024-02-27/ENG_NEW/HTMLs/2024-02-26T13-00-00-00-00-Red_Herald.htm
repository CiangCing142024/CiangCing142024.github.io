Testimonies will be done by those who are directly affected by the case, and the Judging Committee will carry out an inspection visit and listen to the case’s lawyers’ report on the crimes committed by the land grabbers so that, on March 10, 2024, each member can comment about everything they read, saw, heard, exposing their personal considerations and evaluations. In the end, a single report will be produced with the necessary steps”, it concludes.
