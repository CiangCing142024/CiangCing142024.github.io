  The last study of INPS also confirms the difference of 
 treatment of women who work
 </b>
 In Italy by the "young workers 
 to retirees ”as reported an article of the Republic of 22 February last, 
 Smely once again, with data and strongly, Meloni's propaganda 
 shouted by the electoral stages, and not only for the wage difference and of the 
 pensions, but also for the number of women at work since
 <b>

 And inactive there are several millions of unemployed women.

 <p>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">
  As for the so -called
  <i>
   gender pay gap
  </i>
  , And 
 that is, the difference in pay, you get there regarding pensions at 40 
 billion!
  <o:p>
  </o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">
  “In 2022 they were paid by INPS 322 billion in 
 Pensions and assistance performance.
  <b>
   141 billion went to women
  </b>
  .
  <b>
   To men 180 billion
  </b>
  . With a difference of almost 40 billion. 
 This is despite the average, women are holding more than one pension, 
 As happens when reversibility is. AND

 Numerous retirees: 8.3 million against 7.8.
  </b>
  Women are 52% but 
 they take 44%.

 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">
  The causes, according to the study, but that women live daily 
 on your skin, they are “intermittent careers, chopped by needs 
 of maternity and care. Fixed-term and part-time contracts, chosen or mostly 
 forced. But also a structural difference in the hourly salary between man 
 and woman (horizontal segregation). Also in the public administration. AND 
 everywhere at the highest levels, those of the management, to whom women arrive in 
 few (vertical segregation). " All this ends "on the defendants' counter".
  <o:p>

 <p class="MsoNormal">
  “Il
  <i>
   gender gap
  </i>
  Start from work. - continues the 
 Daily - Also in 2022, the annual salary gap between women and 
 man in the private sector was on average 6 thousand euros per year: 17,300 euros account 
 24,500 euros per year, 97 euros against 106 euros per day. A difference of 40% 
 which, although calculated as the INPS does for the same conditions (age, contracts, hours 
 worked), never reset and reaches a 12-13% stable.
  <o:p>
  </o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">
  Almost half of Italian women work in part-time (47.7%) 
 against less than a fifth of men (17.4%). Paid days in a 
 Year to women are 221 against 234 of men. And this explains a lot of 
 you can. "
  <o:p>
  </o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">
  And the public sector is not even saved, says the 
 Journalist, “considered safe and sheltered from inequalities. Instead no. " Why: 
 "The remuneration gap, albeit lower than the private individual, exists: 5,200 euros per year, 
 15-20 euros per day: 28,400 euros against 33,600 euros per year, 95 euros against 
 114 euros per day. The gap is created from the growing appeal in the PA 
 of short contracts, especially in school and healthcare, where the presence 
 of women is relevant. Even part-time, certainly less present than in 
 Private, it concerns women double men (6% against 3%). Two thirds of 
 All public workers are women. "
  <o:p>
  </o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">
  “There is no escape even at home. Parental leave comes 
 asked 80% by women. And the gap with companions is very large, above all 
 up to the three years of the son. The fathers, when they ask, are mostly 
 workers of large companies and full -time. While 46% of mothers 
 applicants and part-time.
  <b>
   Women penalized at work, in the paycheck, a

  Therefore when the newspaper of the Agnelli puts “on the counter 
 of the defendants ... intermittent careers, chopped by needs of 
 maternity and care. Fixed-term and part-time contracts, chosen or mostly 
 forced "tries to give an" aseptic "," objective "picture of the state of 
 things, as if all this did not depend on the capitalist-imperialist exploitation system, 
 A system that must be reversed by a political and social revolution.
