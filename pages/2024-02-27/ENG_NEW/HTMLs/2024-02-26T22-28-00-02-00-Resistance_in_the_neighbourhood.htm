  The dependent and unmistakable bourgeoisie of Greece, the country and the people with the immediate involvement of the plans and wars of the US-NATO, leads to a dangerous course.
 </p>
 <p>
  While the people of Ukraine watered the West -Russia confrontation with their blood and the nuclear trap is trampled on over Europe •
 </p>
 <p>
  At a time when the people of Palestine are bombardedly bombarded, giving tens of thousands of dead by the fascist-Zionist state of Israel with the protection of the US-EU and is in danger of a new mass displacement from its land •
 </p>
 <p>
  The ND government, with the support of PASOK, SYRIZA and fascist parties, is ginging that the murderers of the US peoples consider it the most obedient "child" and assigns the roles of direct participation in their war plans. The "congratulations" of US officials on the remarkable of the country's armed forces are a forerunner to make the statements of ministers to make, "we will give our blood again for the allies", meaning the blood of the children of the people of course!
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  This submission and the unmistakable adventurism of the entire bourgeoisie to "satisfy" its baby -fillingness leads:
 </p>
 <p>
  • In the department of frigate for participation in US-M war operations. Britain in the Red Sea, against Yemen.
 </p>
 <p>
  • Participating in the business with the nickname ASPIDES of EE, even undertaking the management of the business.
 </p>
 <p>
  • The concession of any territory, air and sea for military bases, war or other US -NATO operations and the mission of forces where requested.
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   <span style="white-space: pre;">
   </span>
   The bourgeoisie of the country and its governments over time have every reason to pursue this policy, as they have ascended to power with the support, and with the weapons of the foreign factor.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  But our people should not forget the younger generation to find out what they have paid for when it was called to become "meat" for the canons of the imperialists.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   <u>
    1919:
   </u>
  </b>
  At the beginning of the year, the Greek army's participation in Ukraine, in the war declared France, England, the US against the newly established state of workers and the people, the Soviet Union, begins. It had preceded, in November 1918, a telegram of El. Venizelos to the Greek Ambassador to Paris "please declare Prime Minister and Foreign Ministry that the Greek Army is at their disposal and may be used by a common struggle, where his mission is considered necessary." 23,351 men were sent to Ukraine, killed 1055 (others talking about 1300), and many joined the Red Army lines. Apocalyptic of the kind of operation is that they forced the Greek soldiers to turn against the French sailors who had been revolted and did not want to fight against the people of the Soviet Union. The imperialists were defeated and the Greek army returned in the spring of 1919.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   <u>
    1919-1922:
   </u>
  </b>
  The imperialists, mainly the English, encouraging the Modern Moderate and the Great Rebellion of the bourgeoisie, for their own interests against the Ottoman Empire, pushing it into the campaign in Asia Minor with the painful results for the Greeks. Over 1,500,000 refugees, about 25,000 dead soldiers, an unknown number of missing soldiers and Greeks in Asia Minor.
  <b>
   The war ended whenever they wanted the terms imposed by the imperialists!
  </b>
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   <u>
    1950-1955:
   </u>
  </b>
  The bourgeoisie has grabbed power with the weapons of Scobby and Napalm bombs in the US. It holds thousands in the dry, others imprison and exterminates and the people as a whole are narrowing under poverty and state violence. So he is eagerly seeking the support of the West (to join NATO) and sends, as credentials, an expeditionary body in distant Korea in the war declared by the US and their allies against communism! A total of 10,255 men were sent in succession and an aviation flock. 186, 577 were injured and destroyed 4 C-47 aircraft in a war that has been described as "the forgotten war"!
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   <u>
    1974:
   </u>
  </b>
  The military junta of Greece is encouraged by the US and overturns Makarios, the President of the Republic of Cyprus, thereby giving Turkey's bourgeoisie to intervene in Cyprus and occupy the northern part of it in 1974.
 </p>

   2022
  </b>
  Ukraine becomes a field of confrontation between Russia -West. In all these imperialist operations, the US -based bases in the country and especially in Souda and Akrotiri Chania, as well as the whole country offered to serve the war plans of the imperialists. Military forces are included in NATO and participate in operations.
 </p>
 <p>
  Today, when the US -Russia and China exacerbation of competitions are generating new warships with destruction of countries, throwing up refugees and the deaths of thousands of oppressed, at the same time as threats to nuclear dwelling, it is imperative. Our people to go on the way of the struggle, to strengthen the anti-war-anti-imperialist movement and
  <b>
   to demand:
  </b>
 </p>
 <p>
  No involvement of the country in the wars and plans of the imperialists. Do not leave the frigates for the Red Sea! No involvement of the country in the slaughter of the Palestinian people. To demand, in mind that only a mass decisive movement can be effective.
 </p>
 <p>
  The anti -war -anti -imperialist struggle to "paint" the struggles for bread - Diakia, Freedom Studies. The forces that really refer to the Left, the story has shown that they are judged by their contribution to these struggles and not to election rates.
