  Tomorrow, February 27, Mario Draghi will be at the Conference of 
 Presidents of Commission of the European Parliament, in Strasbourg, to talk about the 
 his next
  <b>
   competitiveness report
  </b>
  of the expected European economy 
 for June and the need for a "paradigm change" of politics e 
 of the economy of the European Union.
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">
  <o:p>
  </o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">
  The former president of the Italian Council does not turn around, 
 Draghi, who in this case represents the genuine voice of the whole of the countries 
 imperialists of Europe, divided and fighting within them by history e 
 capitalist development level: the "paradigm change" is necessary for 
 "Compete with the United States in an increasingly armed and violent world" (see the 
 Manifesto of February 25) but also with China ...
  <o:p>
  </o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">
  For Draghi the difference with other imperialist countries is 
 in all sectors: «In the
  <b>
   productivity
  </b>
  , in the growth of
  <b>
   Pil
  </b>
  , 
 in the per capita GDP ». "The global economic order in which Europe has thrived 
 it's shaken, "he says,
  <b>
   on high dependence on Russian energy
  </b>
  , give her
  <b>
   exports 
 Chinese
  </b>
  and from the
  <b>
   Dependence for defense from the USA
  </b>
  e
  <b>
   from the 
 digital industrial production
  </b>
  .”
  <o:p>
  </o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">
  To give a turning point "Colossal investments are needed"! Alone 
 In the green and digital transition they need “500 billion a year, to pay the 
 cutting costs of 90% of emissions by 2040 (
  <b>
   800 billion 
 per year
  </b>
  , estimated the ECB president Lagarde;
  <b>
   75 billion to be given to 
 Born and respect the 2% commitment of GDP per year in arms
  </b>
  . With governments 
 who have their hands linked by the stability pact, it would be necessary to mobilize the 
 Private savings to feed European financial capitalism. In Europe, 
 he would have remembered Draghi, instead the fragmentation prevails and 250 billion of 
 Euro per year fall into Wall Street. "
  <o:p>
  </o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">
  That the appearance of the "defense" is the main one, it 
 Confirm Valdis Dombrovskis, Latvian vice-president of the EU Commission, and “Uno 
 of the clients of dragons ":“ It is clear that the defense-dimensions will have a place 
 much more important in our agenda - said Dombrovskis - we have a 
 paradigm change from the basic supply chain model 
 on the efficiency of the supply chain model based on resilience. And it's 
 clear that even resilience and economic security will not reach the cost 
 zero. This will involve costs ".
  <o:p>
  </o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">
  "Costs": money but above all as conditions of life and 
 work that fall and fall even more on the shoulders of the proletariat and the 
 Popular masses of all of Europe!
  <o:p>
  </o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">
  Despite the cannonate of the ongoing wars, despite 
 dead and wounded to thousands, despite the generalized destruction the representatives 
 of the bourgeoisie do not lose sight of their class interests! Every day they must 
 find the way to continue to guarantee their social system of death e 
 putrefaction ... every day, therefore, the proletariat and the popular masses have the 
 duty to find the ways to end it with this capitalist-imperialist system.
  <o:p>
  </o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">
  PS.: of Mario Draghi this said Joe Biden, after having it 
 awarded as a "world statesman": "I congratulate my friend, first 
 Minister Mario Draghi ", awarded the World Statesman Award," for the 
 his work in making human rights progress on the planet. Draghi was one 
 powerful voice in promoting tolerance and justice and I thank him for the 
 his leadership ".
  <o:p>
  </o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">
  The correct vision on dragons expressed in this blog was 
 Instead this: "Man of the most servant of the servants of imperialism 
 USA ", for his watery support/commitment for war 
 interimperialist, for the increase in financing for NATO, for its link 
 with the worst reactionary regimes of the "USA", from Egypt, to 
 Türkiye, from India, to Libya, human rights and oppressor massacrators 
 of their peoples,
  <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">
  </span>
  for its tolerance 
 towards fascists, racists ... "
