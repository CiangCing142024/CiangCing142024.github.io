It had preceded, in November 1918, a telegram of El. Venizelos to the Greek Ambassador to Paris \"please declare Prime Minister and Foreign Ministry that the Greek Army is at their disposal and may be used by a common struggle, where his mission is considered necessary.\" 23,351 men were sent to Ukraine, killed 1055 (others talking about 1300), and many joined the Red Army lines. Apocalyptic of the kind of operation is that they forced the Greek soldiers to turn against the French sailors who had been revolted and did not want to fight against the people of the Soviet Union. The imperialists were defeated and the Greek army returned in the spring of 1919.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <b>\n   <u>\n    1919-1922:\n   </u>\n  </b>\n  The imperialists, mainly the English, encouraging the Modern Moderate and the Great Rebellion of the bourgeoisie, for their own interests against the Ottoman Empire, pushing it into the campaign in Asia Minor with the painful results for the Greeks. Over 1,500,000 refugees, about 25,000 dead soldiers, an unknown number of missing soldiers and Greeks in Asia Minor.\n  <b>\n   The war ended whenever they wanted the terms imposed by the imperialists!\n  </b>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <b>\n   <u>\n    1950-1955:\n   </u>\n  </b>\n  The bourgeoisie has grabbed power with the weapons of Scobby and Napalm bombs in the US. It holds thousands in the dry, others imprison and exterminates and the people as a whole are narrowing under poverty and state violence. So he is eagerly seeking the support of the West (to join NATO) and sends, as credentials, an expeditionary body in distant Korea in the war declared by the US and their allies against communism! A total of 10,255 men were sent in succession and an aviation flock. 186, 577 were injured and destroyed 4 C-47 aircraft in a war that has been described as \"the forgotten war\"!\n </p>\n <p>\n  <b>\n   <u>\n    1974:\n   </u>\n  </b>\n  The military junta of Greece is encouraged by the US and overturns Makarios, the President of the Republic of Cyprus, thereby giving Turkey's bourgeoisie to intervene in Cyprus and occupy the northern part of it in 1974.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <b>\n   1991\n  </b>\n  US invasion into Iraq,\n  <b>\n   1999\n  </b>\n  NATO bombings against Belgrade and Yugoslavia,\n  <b>\n   2001\n  </b>\n  NATO attack in Afghanistan,\n  <b>\n   2003\n  </b>\n  invasion of the US and their allies in Iraq,\n  <b>\n   2011\n  </b>\n  NATO raid in Libya.\n  <b>\n   2022\n  </b>\n  Ukraine becomes a field of confrontation between Russia -West. In all these imperialist operations, the US -based bases in the country and especially in Souda and Akrotiri Chania, as well as the whole country offered to serve the war plans of the imperialists. Military forces are included in NATO and participate in operations.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Today, when the US -Russia and China exacerbation of competitions are generating new warships with destruction of countries, throwing up refugees and the deaths of thousands of oppressed, at the same time as threats to nuclear dwelling, it is imperative. Our people to go on the way of the struggle, to strengthen the anti-war-anti-imperialist movement and\n  <b>\n   to demand:\n  </b>\n </p>\n <p>\n  No involvement of the country in the wars and plans of the imperialists. Do not leave the frigates for the Red Sea! No involvement of the country in the slaughter of the Palestinian people. To demand, in mind that only a mass decisive movement can be effective.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The anti -war -anti -imperialist struggle to \"paint\" the struggles for bread - Diakia, Freedom Studies.
