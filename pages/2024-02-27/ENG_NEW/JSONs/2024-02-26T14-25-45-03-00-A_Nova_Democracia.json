At one point, three Moto MPs, including the infamous police \u201cPitbull,\u201d known for the aggressiveness, stopped in front of him. Pitbull surrendered him and soon threw it on his face. Deyvison was taken to the hospital and was kept isolated, with no possibility of family visit.\n </p>\n <div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n  <figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\">\n   <img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-169992\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"860\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" src=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WhatsApp-Image-2024-02-23-at-18.27.47-1024x860.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WhatsApp-Image-2024-02-23-at-18.27.47-1024x860.jpeg\" width=\"1024\"/>\n  </figure>\n </div>\n <p>\n  At the time of the event, in a video released on social networks, a resident predicts:\n  <strong>\n   \u201cOnly the police entered the hospital, banned family members from entering the hospital, certainly to put something on the victim to say he is wrong. But we know not. The family [his] everyone knows, the whole neighborhood is moved \u201d\n  </strong>\n  .

On February 22, residents continued to protest with the same intensity and indignation: they closed a bridge in the city center, made demonstrations in front of the police station, the Military Police Battalion and closed the BR-101 once again. On the third day of the demonstration, on 23/02, residents continued closing the BR-101, confronting firefighters who tried to erase the flames of the tires and who retreated against the popular action.\n </p>\n <p>\n  These three -day actions opened the strength and indignation of the stairs, who refuses to admit police neglect, and claims justice to Deyvidson and his seven -month wife. Pernambuco witnesses today the fair fury of a people who tired of seeing another worker being killed for nothing, without any liability of the criminal executors of the Military Police and the criminal state that protect them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   See other videos of the three days of protest:\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <figure class=\"wp-block-video aligncenter\">\n  <video controls=\"\" src=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WhatsApp-Video-2024-02-23-at-18.27.47.mp4\">\n  </video>\n  <figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">\n   Protest on February 22.
