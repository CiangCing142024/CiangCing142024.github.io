The incident. took place as she threw candy into the crowd like a carnival queen. As an article in a reactionary newspaper has written on the opinion side, the dozens of deaths that her government has caused using the armed forces and police, tied around her neck and pulling her down and will end up lowering her. Now she is doomed not to travel in the country, her advertised intention to visit Ouno these days has been rejected and she is sitting in the government palace and considering: traveling or not to travel is the question.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now the Peruvian people who continue their rejection, condemnation and rejection of Dina Boluarte's fascist, folk murderous and homeland -selling government have demonstrated in Puno, as the newspapers have reported:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \u00bbMinister of Culture Leslie Urteaga had an eventful visit to Puno on Sunday,\n  <a href=\"https://www.infobae.com/peru/2024/02/03/ministra-de-cultura-leslie-urteaga-fue-echada-de-evento-publico-en-puno-largate-gobierno-asesino/\">\n   where a group of citizens jogged her away under insults while she demanded justice for those killed in the protests\n  </a>\n  against the government. Under the traditional entrada de Kapus, the protesters shouted slogans as \"murderous government\", \"disappear from Puno\", \"What do you want here?\" But she ignored them all the time.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The portfolio manager stated that despite the signs of rejection from the executive power, she will continue with her visits to other regions. \u201cI think we sometimes ministers are missing time to visit all the places we want. This question of humiliation or verbal aggression is not going to stop us from continuing to work, \u201dshe said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The mass's rejection of the government is in full swing. As we have said:\n </p>\n <p>\n  The crisis at all levels, the reactionary measures to read the burden of the crisis onto the masses, sow wind and must harvest storm. The fiscal adaptation policy with cuts in pensions, rights and benefits, with worsening of employment and wages, with the reduction of 'support' and subsidies, with more and more rot and inefficiencies of the old state from top to toe and the genocide of the masses increase the masses Day by day, and the protest and resistance of the popular masses as their counterpart grows, the masses are more active and in motion. The reaction brings the revolution to life.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Crisis in ancient society, crisis in the bureaucratic capitalism and crisis of the old landlord-bureaucratic state that defends and maintains it. Crisis in parliament and in all the bourgeois-democratic institutions. Submission of the other powers to the executive power with the support and support of the reactionary armed forces and the bureaucratic state apparatus. The situation has not been significantly changed by the current situation where the existence of the current government depends on the will of parliament, and the existence of the present parliament with its current composition depends on the will of the genocide president. It happens in a fierce battle between the factions of the big citizenship and the struggle and the struggle of the masses and resistance to rights, freedoms and goods, which are the basis of their mobilization, so that the party can raise them for political struggle to fight for power by joining the People's War. This is why it is necessary to complete the general reorganization of the party. Chairman Gonzalo says on the 2nd plenary: To see the new fascism, it is very important to elaborate on the study and the foundation found in \"Comments on the coup in 1992\" both in compressor citizenship and in the bureaucratic citizenship.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The fire of the three mountains' exploitation and oppression of the masses of workers, peasants and petty bourgeoisie and the national bourgeoisie, which is facing further ruin. The masses who are struggling to keep what they have won in the hard class struggle, and not to be further impoverished by the new crisis, ups and downs that will repeat themselves cyclically in this ruling system, and as only the invincible People's War will be able to sweep away. The masses 'opposition to the reactionary governments' famous 'economic and work reforms and adaptations' that try to read the serious crisis in this outdated system of exploitation and oppression over the masses, both in the countryside and in the city, this crisis sharpens the contradiction between the popular masses and the reactionary government. It is an expression of the tightening of the contradictions of ancient society: mass-feudalism, folk-bureaucratic capitalism and nation-imperialism, which can only be solved by leading the democratic uprising to the end of people war.\n </p>\n <h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center\">\n  <strong>\n   The killer Dina Boluarte replaces her secretaries of ministers\n  </strong>\n </h3>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   14th of February\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <em>\n   We publish an unofficial translation of the following article.

The presidency confirmed that the head of state would take at least five ministers in oath at 1 p.m. 18.00: \u00c1lex Contreras (Economics and Finance), Miriam Ponce (Education), Albina Ru\u00edz (Environment), \u00d3scar Vera (Energy and Miner) and Jorge Ch\u00e1vez (Defense).\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was later revealed that the new finance and finance minister is Jos\u00e9 Arista. Previously, it was \u00c1lex Contreras.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As the same newspaper reports, the ministerial crisis with some ministers' departure and the redeployment of the cabinet with the new ministers mentioned above is a clear sign of the old state's rot, which is expressed in all its institutions and more open in the executive power , where the ministers go because of big questions, not only about incompetence, but also rottenness and a consequence of secret agreements and struggles within and with the other powers and institutions of the old state.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Furthermore, this remodeling of Otarola's cabinet is a lifeline to try to maintain the Boluarthe Otarola government, a fascist genocomeric and homeland-selling government in the service of imperialism, mainly Yankee imperialism.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The new Minister of Finance and Finance was the regional president of the Amazon, a post he had from 2011 to 2014. And like all regional presidents, there are no exceptions, he has the following complaints:\n </p>\n <p>\n  The new Minister of Economy, Jos\u00e9 Arista Arbildo, has three complaints with the State Attorney. The replacement for Alex Contreras is accused of negotiating incompatible or drawn undue advantage of his position, extortion by cheating the state of its assets and abuse of authority.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He has already served as minister under Yankee Kusynki, was Minister of Agriculture in 2018 and by 2020, under the short-term Merino government, he was the leader of the Ministry of Economy and Finance.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He is a large national and international bureaucrat breastfeeding by Yankee imperialism; He belongs to the high state bureaucracy, the \"autopilot\" in the old landlord-bureaucratic state in the service of imperialism, which the counter-revolutionary Rondero Castillo Terrone confided in his speech on July 28, 2021, a high state bureaucracy that has been on \"pilot\" since The beginning of the current regime in 1992 and has earned almost all governments, as Jos\u00e9 Arista's Curriculum Vitae says:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Jos\u00e9 Arista has a master's degree in economics from the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) and a specialization course at the Catholic University of Chile (project evaluation).\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Jos\u00e9 Arista's career in the Peruvian state began in 1990 as national director of the public budget in MEF, in 1992 he supported the establishment of Sunat, and in 1997 he was responsible for the development of the tax administration (SAT). Between 2006 and 2010 he was Deputy Finance Minister.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Subsequently, Jos\u00e9 Arista was elected regional president in the Amazon and worked in the period 2011-2014.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The following year, the Ministry of Education appointed him project director for the preparation and development of the Pan American Games in 2019.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Between January and April 2018, Jos\u00e9 Arista was Minister of Agriculture and irrigation under Pedro Pablo Kuczynski's government.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Jos\u00e9 Arista has also been director of Banco de la Naci\u00f3n (\n  <em>\n   Ed. - Danmarks Nationalbank\n  </em>\n  ), Deputy Governor of the Inter -American Development Bank (IDB,\n  <em>\n   red. \u2013 Inter-American Development Bank\n  </em>\n  ), and he is currently working as a consultant for financial services in Latin America Development Bank (CAF).\n </p>\n <h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center\">\n  <strong>\n   Turkey\n  </strong>\n </h2>\n <h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center\">\n  <strong>\n   Updating the case of the imprisoned journalist from Yeni Democrasi\n  </strong>\n </h3>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   January 29\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">\n  <img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6557\" data-attachment-id=\"6557\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"billede-50\" data-large-file=\"https://socialistiskrevolution.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/billede-50.png?w=663\" data-medium-file=\"https://socialistiskrevolution.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/billede-50.png?w=300\" data-orig-file=\"https://socialistiskrevolution.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/billede-50.png\" data-orig-size=\"663,375\" data-permalink=\"https://socialistiskrevolution.wordpress.com/2024/02/26/nyheder-om-folkekrigene-rundt-om-i-verden-26-02-2024/billede-50-7/\" height=\"375\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 663px) 100vw, 663px\" src=\"https://socialistiskrevolution.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/billede-50.png?w=663\" srcset=\"https://socialistiskrevolution.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/billede-50.png?w=663\" width=\"663\"/>\n  <figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">\n   <br/>\n   <em>\n    Rapporter Ertan Clay:\n    <a href=\"http://yenidemokrasi34.net/\">\n     New democracy\n    </a>\n    .\n   </em>\n  </figcaption>\n </figure>\n <p>\n  The imprisoned journalist from the newspaper Yeni Democrasi, Ertan \u00e7\u0131ta, has become\n  <a href=\"https://www.yenidemokrasi34.net/muhabirimiz-ertan-cita-hakkinda-tahliye-karari.html\">\n   released\n  </a>\n  to await the trial. \u00c7\u0131ta was arrested on October 3, 2023 for his work to inform the public about the reality that the ruling classes want to keep them unaware of.

Several democratic rights, such as association for the protection of democratic rights (APDR) and student organizations, organized a protest at the International Book Fair in Calcutta, where police triggered violence against protesters and detained 14 people. Shakhdeep and Abhinav Das were among the detainees and were later charged with section 353, 186, 506 and 34 of the Indian Criminal Code. As far as we know, the two denied bail on January 30, 2024, and they have now been moved to legal custody until February 1st.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The case began on January 28, 2024, when students from RSF and many other social policy activists demonstrated at the same international book fair in Calcutta to relieve political prisoners Prashant Bose, Pramod Mishra, Sheela Marandi, Arun Kumar Bhattacharya, Jayita Das, Sabyasachi Goswami, Pratik Bhowmik, Montu Mallick, Manik Biswas and Amiruddin Ahmed. Casr recently published a statement about some of these arrests and how the Indian state continues to violate all legal procedures and make fun of his democratic rights as it stamps political activists with the red stamp \"Maoism\". Some of these activists are in the late '70s, and their lives are now in custody of the same Indian state that has committed the murder of Pandu Narote and 84-year-old father Stan Swamy because of medical negligence. The protest on January 28 was about the increasing number of arrests of political activists with the excuse that one would catch \"senior Maoist leaders\". In particular, the arrests go beyond political activists who are fighting for the working class, peasants, the oppressed women's and the casters 'case, as well as against Adivasis' Landgrab and the fight for Jal-Jangal-Jameen.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The protest on January 28 was also about the requirement of immediate initiation of a trial for these political activists, where many of them have been in police custody for days, without their families and the public having received any reports or information on where they are located . The protesters on January 28 were also met with undemocratic oppression when police canceled the protest at short notice. Police tried to grab the activists' phones and delete the footage of their attacks on activists during the detention in an undemocratic way. During the same period, the police failed to intervene when Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) attacked political activists and owners of book stalls who had set up posters in solidarity with the Palestinian national liberation movement at the same book fair. The Mamata Bannerjee-led West Bengal Government's indulgence and service to the Brahmanian Hindutva-fascist forces and their politics is visible in the way it deals with pro-popular democratically minded activists towards fascist mob groups. The same Trinamool Congress government in the West Bengal has ensured that the fascist restriction of the struggle for democratic rights and the general restriction of political disagreement is pursued recklessly, where even the demand for the release of political prisoners such as Pramod Mishra, Prashant Bose, Sheela Marandi, Sabyasachi Goswami And others have become an act that justifies police brutality, torture and arrests of students.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Casr is deeply concerned about Shakhdeep and Abhinav Das' well -being and condemns police brutality and their politically motivated arrests.\n </p>\n <p>\n  CASR requires immediate release of Shakhdeep and Abhinav Das and the release of all political prisoners!\n </p>\n <p>\n  Campaign against state oppression\n </p>\n <p>\n  (CASR)\n </p>\n <p>\n  Constitutions: AirSO, AISA, AISF, APCR, BASF, BSM, BHIM HEARS, BIGUL MAZDOOR DASTA, BSCEM CEM, CRPP, CTF, DISH DISC, DSU, DTF, Forum against suppression telangana, fraternity, IAPL, Network for Innocence , Karnataka Janashakti, The Association of Progressive Attorneys, Mazdoor Adhikar Sangathan, Mazdoor Patrika, Napm, NBS, Nishant Natya Manch, Nowruz, NTUI, People's Guard, Rihai Manch, Samajwadi Janparishad, Smajwadi Lok Manch, Bahujan Samjavadi Manch, Sfi, Sfi, Sfi, , United Peace Alliances, WSS, Y4S.\n </p>\n <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">\n  <img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6540\" data-attachment-id=\"6540\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"billede-37\" data-large-file=\"https://socialistiskrevolution.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/billede-37.png?w=619\" data-medium-file=\"https://socialistiskrevolution.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/billede-37.png?w=181\" data-orig-file=\"https://socialistiskrevolution.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/billede-37.png\" data-orig-size=\"670,1109\" data-permalink=\"https://socialistiskrevolution.wordpress.com/2024/02/26/nyheder-om-folkekrigene-rundt-om-i-verden-26-02-2024/billede-37-9/\" height=\"1024\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 619px) 100vw, 619px\" src=\"https://socialistiskrevolution.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/billede-37.png?w=619\" srcset=\"https://socialistiskrevolution.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/billede-37.png?w=619\" width=\"619\"/>\n  <figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">\n   <br/>\n   <em>\n    Map of the Districts in Chhattisgarh.

These villages are located on the border of the Sukma-Bijapur districts in Chhattisgarh.\n  <strong>\n   In another recent incident, Ramesh Poyam from the village of Bodga in Bastar was shot by the bullets of police and the paramilitary forces on January 30, 2024\n  </strong>\n  , when he would take a bath in the nearby river. The forces were allegedly on their way back from the Abujhmad region after blasting a 130-meter-long Maoist tunnel and destroyed the Maoists' Martyrs' Memorial 'when they got into battle with the Maoist forces. After the shooting stopped and Ramesh went to the bath, he was allegedly shot by the forces, and once again the killing has been justified with the excuse \"Cross Herring with Naxalites\". Ramesh had come to his sister's house to invite her to a party on the occasion of his child's birth two days ago.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The unery -laid civil war in central India has escalated rapidly in recent months. The killings of Adivasi farmers are justified either as a \"Maoist clash\" or \"cross-fire\", and the life of the Adivasi farmers is simply made into statistics of consequential damage in the state's \"anti-naxal operations\". Moreover\n  <strong>\n   is the fifth time within a three-year period that the Indian state has resorted to throwing bombs in the head of its own population as part of Operation Samadhan-Prahar\n  </strong>\n  in the effort to quickly expand the looting of natural resources in the region and eradicate the adivasi farmers through large-scale militarization for this purpose. These villages are not strangers to such bombings. Mettaguda and Bottethong have been repeatedly the air bomb since April 14, 2022, when 35 explosions took place in the villages and the surrounding areas. Exactly one year before the current incident, January 11, 2023, the villages of Metaguda, Bottethong and Errapali were exposed to these bombings. In an investigative report published by coordination of organizations for democratic rights (CDRO) entitled \u00bb\n  <em>\n   When the sky spits fire\n  </em>\n  \u00abAbout the air bombings on January 11, 2023, a local says:\u201c We had gone out early in the morning [in the woods] to collect Mahua magazines when a drone suddenly came from the top and threw bombs down over us. We did not understand what happened. \u201dAdivasi farmers who cultivate their traditional activities of gathering mahua magazines to sell them finds no peace in their lives as the Indian State's Operation Samadhan-Prahar uses more and more folk murderous methods To wipe out their existence, all under the pretext of fighting Maoism. The use of drones for air bombardments has now also become a practice that takes place not only in Bastar, but reportedly in other parts of India.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   On January 8, 2024, reports of drone -based air bombings near the border between India and Myanmar\n  </strong>\n  , which was allegedly aimed at the Assam-based rebel group united national liberation front in ASOM (independent), which does not participate in peace talks with the Indian state.\n  <strong>\n   Four days later, on January 12, 2024, reports came that the Indian state used drones again to throw bombs near the Pangsau border in the Changland district of Arunachal Pradesh, which is a densely populated area\n  </strong>\n  . Once again, the attack was carried out with the excuse that it should limit a separatist movement, this time the Naga movement-national Socialist Council in Nagaland- Khaplang (Yung Aung).\n  <strong>\n   Over the course of five days, the Indian state made drone attacks in three different parts of the country, aimed at Adivasi farmers in Bastar and oppressed nationalities in the Northeast, just a few days before the state celebrated the adoption of the Indian constitution, and that India became a so-called republic.\n  </strong>\n  We believe that this expansion of air strikes is a reflection of an experiment performed in central India and which has been conveniently killed by the state and has therefore not been subject to sufficient scrutiny. Also, it should come as no surprise that the Indian state is increasingly using Israeli-made Heron Mark 2 drones for these air bombardments and now has not only become the world's largest weapon buyer but also Israel's largest weapon customer importing a number of weapons , unmanned aircraft, missiles and even technology such as Pegasus surveillance software that it has used against democratically minded activists. Similar to the Zionist state and its restriction of the Palestinian people's right to self -determination and the genocide it performs in Gaza, another attempt at genocide while sailing in Bastar with mobilization of 3000 paramilitary forces during Operation Kagar is. The use of air bombs in internal conflicts that jeopardize the life of the civilian population, regardless of what the political cause may be, is not only a violation of democratic rights in the Indian constitution and national law, but is also an international problem as it is in Review with the Hague Convention of 1907 and Protocol 1 to the Geneva Conventions.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This escalation of the war in Bastar alone witnessed the murder of a child of 6 months in Mutvandi on January 1st, the false meeting with 3 peasants in Nendra on January 16 and the killing of Ramesh Poyam on January 30. Right now, we are receiving information from members of Moolwasi Bachao Manch that forces have fired rocket grenades in villages around the newly created camp in Tekalguda, where they lost 3 CRPF soldiers, and 14 were injured in the Maoist attack on a building on January 30 2024. We believe that the escalation of the war caused by the increased militarization and the Maoists' counter -attacks will cause the frustrated soldiers to carry out more reckless attacks like these in the coming days and that it will create chaos for Bastar's population if Not the democratic progressive forces across the country are together to fight it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  We repeat the same question that was asked by an adivasi farmer:\n  <strong>\n   \u00bb\n  </strong>\n  <strong>\n   Why are there these attacks in Bastar? Is it a foreign country? We have to go in the field to get something to eat, and the soldiers fill our bodies with bullets.

In Hyderabad, the well -known author and journalist N. Venugopal and N.Ravi Sharma's house were searched. Over the past six months, NIA in Telangana has often searched various social and political activists and tried to involve them in false reviews. N.Ravi Sharma is a writer and rights activist whose house was searched by NIA once and by the state police a second time recently. N.Ravi Sharma was also arrested in 2019, but they were released against bail because the state has no evidence that this activist is a member of the forbidden IKP (Maoists) and is involved in violent activities. He has worked in the forum against Hinduthva-fascist offensive (FAHFO) to counter the rising wave of Brahmanist Hindutva fascism and reveal its popular nature. For this very reason, it was banned by Telangana's government in 2021 together with 15 other organizations. Later, after three months, this ban was withdrawn by the government itself when it was challenged in Telangana's Supreme Court.\n </p>\n <p>\n  On the same day, Nia makes a raid with the rights activists Ismail and Rashid in Mallpuram and Palakkad in Kerala. It is also reported that two more raids have been completed in Thane, Maharashtra and Chennai, Tamilnadu the same day.\n </p>\n <p>\n  N. Venugopal is also the editor of the popular Telugu Month Month magazine \"Vekshanam\" and nephew of Varavara Rao, a revolutionary poet who was mistakenly charged with the notorious Bhima Koregoan case. N Venugopal has many times been attacked by Telangana police because of his political activism and deviant opinions. In his press release, NIA has claimed that \"front -line members of IKP (Maoists) operated in the urban areas of Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala to promote the activities of the breakers\". It clearly shows that the Brahmanian Hindutva-fascist state wants to stamp the movement of democratic rights in the cities such as the Maoists' above-ground front activity and crush all deviating voices. It is a practice that the Indian state has had for a long time, and these kinds of raids must not be seen in isolation. They are part of the Indian state's propaganda to criminalize all democratic voices that are critical of its exploitation and oppression of the country's population.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Telangana has a brutal history of state oppression of democratic rights. Previously, the police, along with the intelligence services, have obviously killed many democratic rights activists in false meetings. In the last six months, Telangana has surprisingly seen various fours, with more than 140 leaders of civil society and mass organizations being implicated in UAPA cases, even those who died two years before FIR were registered.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As in the Bhima Koregaon case, where NIA struck down on activists across the country using a letter allegedly contained a conspiracy to kill India's prime minister. It is NIA's Modus Operandi to build a tale through the media that before the Razzia arrested a Maoist leader and found a diary with the names of these activists. All over India, the houses of various lawyers, students, journalists, professors and democratic rights activists were searched and the same story was repeated. NIA uses this kind of diaries as a toolbox throughout India to implicate various activists in fake cases.\n </p>\n <p>\n  During the colonial period, the state used its arbitrary power to implicate revolutionaries in conspiracy cases such as the Meerut Conspiracy case and the Lahore Conspiracy case to suppress people's movement against colonial exploitation and oppression. Today we see that the Brahmanian Hindutva-fascist BJP-RSS government learns from its colonial stewards and uses similar tactics to suppress voices against the exploitation and oppression of the people, as well as voices that are against foreign and domestic companies' looting of the country's resources.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Campaign against state oppression (CASR) condemns this oppressive measure in the form of NIA. We believe that this act is an attempt to divert the issue of democratic rights and popular affairs to \"red horror\" by stamping those who raise questions, like Maoists. We urge all democratic and progressive forces to oppose this raid and a major attack on democratic rights.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Campaign against state oppression (CAST)\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Ingredients:\n  </strong>\n  AirSO, AISA, AISF, APCR, BASF, BSM, BHIM HEARS, BIGUL MAZDOOR DASTA, BSCEM CEM, CRPP, CTF, DISH DISC, DSU, DTF, Forum against oppression Telangana, Brotherhood, IAPL, Network for Innocence, Karnataka Janashacti, The Association of Progressive Attorneys, Mazdoor Adhikar Sangathan, Mazdoor Patrika, Napm, NBS, Nishant Natya Manch, Nowruz, NTUI, People's Guard, Rihai Manch, Samajwadi Janparishad, Smajwadi Lok Manch, Bahujan Samjavadi Manch, SFI, Association of Had, Association of Had, Association of Had, Association of Had, Association of Peace Alliances, WSS, Y4S.\n </p>\n <h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center\">\n  <strong>\n   Large peasant protests break out against bureaucratic capitalism\n  </strong>\n </h3>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   13th February\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n  <figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\">\n   <img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6544\" data-attachment-id=\"6544\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"billede-40\" data-large-file=\"https://socialistiskrevolution.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/billede-40.png?w=502\" data-medium-file=\"https://socialistiskrevolution.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/billede-40.png?w=300\" data-orig-file=\"https://socialistiskrevolution.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/billede-40.png\" data-orig-size=\"502,333\" data-permalink=\"https://socialistiskrevolution.wordpress.com/2024/02/26/nyheder-om-folkekrigene-rundt-om-i-verden-26-02-2024/billede-40-8/\" height=\"333\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 502px) 100vw, 502px\" src=\"https://socialistiskrevolution.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/billede-40.png?w=502\" srcset=\"https://socialistiskrevolution.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/billede-40.png?w=502\" width=\"502\"/>\n   <figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">\n    <br/>\n    <em>\n     The peasants' march to Delhi.

They loaded trucks and all kinds of vehicles with food and equipment, ready to travel for a long time and camp in the city if needed. All this happens after failed negotiations with the state authorities, who have obviously deceived the peasants after giving several promises in the past.\n  <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/13/india-farmers-march-what-are-their-demands-why-is-govt-blocking-roads\">\n   Since Tuesday, police have shot with tear gas\n  </a>\n  , fortified the capital and attacked the peasants violently to prevent them from reaching their destination. The Internet has also been interrupted in many places in Haryana, and meetings of a certain size in the capital have been banned. Although most farmers are from Punjab and Haryana, there are groups from Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, who join the protests.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Indian peasants and the current Indian government have come together before. Between 2020 and 2021 there were major protests, and after them Modi and BJP had to withdraw a number of measures that liberalized the agricultural market. In addition, they promised the peasants to take a number of measures, the most prominent of which was to secure the price of the farmers' products to avoid loss for them. Some time ago the Indian government had\n  <a href=\"https://scroll.in/article/885312/explained-the-increase-in-minimum-support-prices-for-14-crops-and-what-it-means-for-farmers\">\n   already promised to double peasants' income\n  </a>\n  by 2022, which was not once again fulfilled. In 2022, the Indian government also promised peasants to stabilize a number of guaranteed prices to maintain the existence of the hard -tried Indian peasants.\n </p>\n <p>\n  All of this has served as a growing broth, so Indian peasants rebel against the ancient Indian state. Finally, after years of waiting and abandonment,\n  <a href=\"https://www.deccanherald.com/india/delhi/explained-why-farmers-are-marching-in-protest-to-delhi-2893643\">\n   requires the Indian peasants guarantees\n  </a>\n  , either through prices set by law or with more state aid, including that the government guarantees state reserves of food and buys products at the minimum prices agreed with the farmers. Another requirement they have is\n  <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/13/india-farmers-march-what-are-their-demands-why-is-govt-blocking-roads\">\n   Agricultural loan remission\n  </a>\n  , and that income exceeds more than 50 percent of production costs. The most active peasants have been the ones from Haryana and Punjab because they have been the largest recipients of the minimum prices that have been set in recent years,\n  <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-in/news/India/explained-why-mainly-farmers-from-punjab-want-legal-msp-and-what-makes-their-demand-so-complex/ar-BB1ij9ot\">\n   Since they sell most of their grain during this price system\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  BJP's government and the Indian ruling class have repeatedly shown that they do not seek to protect the interests of the peasants, but serve the interests of imperialism, primarily the Yankee's. Not only did they break the promises they made after the strong protests in 2020-2021, but lately, the farmers' living conditions have also worsened after the new agreements with the imperialists on the sale of land. Another action that worsened the Terms of the Peasants came a few months ago after the G20, where an agreement was made between Yankee imperialism and the Indian ruling class: India lowered the taxes of many very important agricultural products for Yankee imperialism's economy, which paved the way for mass imports at the expense of local farmers' production.\n  <em>\n   <a href=\"https://redherald.org/2023/09/17/the-interest-of-yankee-imperialism-is-once-again-put-before-the-indian-peasants-interests-during-the-g20/\">\n    As has already been reported\n   </a>\n   About this agreement and the terrible consequences of BJP's measures for the Indian peasants:\n  </em>\n  <em>\n   \u00bb\n  </em>\n  <em>\n   Generally all of these food products have the property that they are\n   <a href=\"https://news.abplive.com/india-at-2047/india-us-trade-deal-opens-market-for-us-farmers-poultry-producers-gets-no-benefits-in-return-1628542\">\n    very widespread products in the Asian country\n   </a>\n   , and therefore their exports are very profitable to the United States.

Among the many bloody debt of the aforementioned mercenary group is their involvement in what is now known as the Sagay 9 massacre on October 20, 2018 in Barangay Bulanon, Sagay City, Negros Occidental.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Sarona Group is also involved in land grabbing, including problems with the country they control through AianDo. Boy Sarona, Juvie's father, administers all the earth under their control.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For fear of the mercenaries, the landowners could not negotiate the conditions of Aiendo. Their trees are unfairly felled and sold to sugar centers such as firewood. Usually, the unproductive/unplanted pieces of land they own are subject to AianDo conditions. Events with tractor and manual work erections were also reported by landowners as well as sugar cane farmers in the neighborhood. Land workers from former landowners (usually taken over by arander with the same terms as the original landowner) have been exposed to work problems during the Sarona group, such as detention of 1-2 days' salary per week and further forfeiture of wages when one cannot work it the following week.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The community around the land that the Sarona group controls also lives in fear because they are exposed to threats and harassment. Members of the Sarona group train their weapons and even shoot at the residents. A Carabao was once shot after accidentally damaging part of a sugar cane field controlled by the said group and the animal owner was still forced to pay for the damaged crops.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Negrosanons, especially the population of northern Negros, celebrate NPA's punishment of the Sarona group. RJPC-NPA is grateful for the boundless support of the population, which secured the successful action against the Sarona, a stone's throw from the provincial road, placed between two hostile departments (Marcelo and Pulupanguyan).\n </p>\n <p>\n  This military action conducted by RJPC-NPA is part of the guerrilla front's celebration of the 55th anniversary of the Filipin 'Communist Party (CPP). It is also a picture of the front's determination to recover from previous losses and rebuild the mass base.\n </p>\n <h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center\">\n  <strong>\n   'Terror Law' will strengthen HRVs and promote impunity culture on Negro's island\n  </strong>\n </h3>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   January 9th\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">\n  <img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6549\" data-attachment-id=\"6549\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"billede-45\" data-large-file=\"https://socialistiskrevolution.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/billede-45.png?w=825\" data-medium-file=\"https://socialistiskrevolution.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/billede-45.png?w=300\" data-orig-file=\"https://socialistiskrevolution.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/billede-45.png\" data-orig-size=\"1024,576\" data-permalink=\"https://socialistiskrevolution.wordpress.com/2024/02/26/nyheder-om-folkekrigene-rundt-om-i-verden-26-02-2024/billede-45-8/\" height=\"464\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px\" src=\"https://socialistiskrevolution.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/billede-45.png?w=825\" srcset=\"https://socialistiskrevolution.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/billede-45.png?w=825\" width=\"825\"/>\n </figure>\n <p>\n  Major General Marion Sison is completely wrong if he believes that the Anti -Terroric Act will put an end to the popular democratic revolution, such as the New Folk Army (NPA), which is under the absolute leadership of the Philippines' Communist Party (PKP).\n </p>\n <p>\n  The fact that the head of the 3rd Infantry Division greets the Supreme Court's procedure rules for petitions and applications in connection with the drakonian anti -terror law simply reveals how fascist he is. The law, which should rightly be called the Terrorist Act, will only increase the number of human rights violations and further nourish the sustained culture of impunity on Negros Island.\n </p>\n <p>\n  To resort to tyrannical measures is an expression of desperation on the part of the reactionary state. The 3rd ID can repeatedly declare that \"the guerrilla front in Negros is dissolved\" that \"the areas are free of rebellion\" and what do I know, but it cannot hide the obvious truth - the People's War is still undefeated, even after five years of counter -revolutionary War on Negros Island.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As long as the roots of the armed conflict are there, the people will continue to cherish, support and join their real army, NPA. The revolutionary movement is in sharp contrast to reactionary fascist institutions that act only in submissiveness to their imperialist masters.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Reactionary leaders are selfish and self -absorbed, while the rich treasure trove of the revolution continues to let older cadres train younger to promote the welfare of the masses. The old will be replaced by the new, and new revolutionary forces will take on new tasks against imperialism, feudalism and bureaucratic capitalism.\n </p>\n <p>\n  No matter how many millions of AFP (the reactionary Armed Forces of the Philippines (Filipins' Armed Forces)) and PNP (Philippine National Police) spend on indescribable war crimes, including air bombings and massacres, the political line of the revolution remains correct because it is based on the interests of the majority of the Philippine people. The Philippine masses are looking for real land reform and national industrialization, and no smart expressions from the National Task Force (NTF))-ELCAC or patch solutions from Barangay development programs can give them. Only a national democratic revolution with a socialist perspective can really solve the problems of the working masses-the same ones that the AFP butchers kill every day.\n </p>\n <h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center\">\n  <strong>\n   AFP and its #dimasaligan79ib is for the rich\n  </strong>\n </h3>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   January 10th\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">\n  <img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6550\" data-attachment-id=\"6550\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"billede-46\" data-large-file=\"https://socialistiskrevolution.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/billede-46.png?w=825\" data-medium-file=\"https://socialistiskrevolution.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/billede-46.png?w=300\" data-orig-file=\"https://socialistiskrevolution.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/billede-46.png\" data-orig-size=\"1024,576\" data-permalink=\"https://socialistiskrevolution.wordpress.com/2024/02/26/nyheder-om-folkekrigene-rundt-om-i-verden-26-02-2024/billede-46-8/\" height=\"464\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px\" src=\"https://socialistiskrevolution.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/billede-46.png?w=825\" srcset=\"https://socialistiskrevolution.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/billede-46.png?w=825\" width=\"825\"/>\n </figure>\n <p>\n  As a spoiled child who gets rage attacks, #Dimasaligan79IB's commander-in-chief Colonel Lieutenant Arnel Calaoagan recently released a statement in which he boasted the terrorist stamp of CPP-NPA-ADF as a whole and Roselyn Jean Pelle Commanded Negros Guerrillafront of the NPA (RJPC ) in particular. Peace Saboteur Calaoagan, who is a trained fascist of American imperialism, flared up and tried to cancel the victory of the people, including the long-desired justice of criminals and counter-revolutionaries as the Sarona group, by simply stamping it as 'acts of violence'.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The population of northern Negros has long demanded the punishment of the Sarona group. Involvement in the massacre of nine country workers in the sagay metropolis (more known as the Sagay 9-massacre), soil theft and work abuse, especially in Barangays in Toboso and Calatrava, Negros Occidental, labor problems, contract problems for their timber business (cheating with payment to owners of timber and utilization of carpenters) and cohabitation with criminals are just some of the many crimes that this mercenary group led by Juvie Sarona has committed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Sarona group is also a counter-revolutionary gun-for-hire syndicate. These mercenaries are active intelligence agents for PNP, who monitor suspected NPA supports in the area. The RJPC-NPA asked for a meeting with the Sarona group to make them understand the seriousness of their actions and the consequences, but they did not respond.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Sarona group was punished for their unforgivable acts against the population of Northern Negros as despotic landlords and counter-revolutionaries. The revolutionary movement does not allow business activities that jeopardize the safety and livelihood of the people within its territory. The RJPC-NPA has not traded with the Sarona group in connection with revolutionary taxation or other financial obligations.\n </p>\n <p>\n  AFP's complicity in such crimes and the pure hypocrisy of condemning actions to punish the Sarona group, which has proven to have committed murder and other abominable crimes against the people, show that Colonel Calaoagan and AFP are instruments to preserve the class interests of the landlords.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Calaoagans and AFP's terminologies and definitions are heavily polluted with the tale of imperialism, bureaucratic capitalism and feudalism. To them, \"peace -loving individuals\" (like Sarona) are those who willingly submit to imperialists', the great compressor of the great compressors and the local landlords, which will lead to \"Peace of Peace\". Meanwhile, they are stamping those who openly oppose such aggressions to defend a large number of people's lives and livelihoods as' terrorists', which according to AFP will result in \u203aViolence '.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Calaoagan's deceitful claims that #Dimasaligan79ib and PNP are \"professionals who do their duty\" ignored the many violations of rights against civil and poor communities in northern Negros that their ranks have committed, including the barbaric killings of Hors de Combat like Ella, Ka Monet, Ka Simo, Ka Huawei and Ka Brod, and declared them victims of false clashes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It is RJPC-NPA's duty to take responsibility for its activities against criminals and counter-revolutionaries to protect the people from baseless accusations and fictional charges from NTF-Elcac and their whole-nation approach. NPA publishes its actions so people can be informed of the reasons behind each military action.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In a \"He says she says\" situation, RJPC-NPA encourages the public (and the media) to investigate the reasons for collecting truthful information. The large number of ordinary citizens are the impartial source of knowledge as opposed to AFP/PNP figures who are in the pocket of the landlords.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Although farmers and country workers are poor and live a modest life, they make sure their beloved NPA gets food and clothing.

Infantry Division is more shameless than ever when they declare new Folk Army (NPA) Guerilla Lter on Negros Island for \"dissolved\" after two false clashes on January 15 and 17 in Calatrava and La Castellana in Negros respectively Occidental. In the second fake meeting, two civilians were taken prisoner and cold -bloodedly murdered by elements of the 62nd infantry battalion.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Units from Roselyn Jean Pelle command-npa northern Negros Guerrillafront are all intact and perform their revolutionary tasks with renewed glow among peasants and land workers, who suffer a lot from landlessness and slave-like wages introduced by notorious despotic hacientos and their mercenaries. The supposed camp that 79. IB soldiers plundered was staged, and the claim of the meeting was taken from AFP's worn drama manuscripts.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Meanwhile, 62. Ib used an old trick of releasing intelligence people who pretended to be confused, to monitor peasant societies and penetrate housing in La Castellana, especially Barangay Sag-Ang, prior to fighting. The 62. Soldiers persecuted families and individuals who had been hiding after they were red -marked and set as a target during the Philippine National Police (PNP) bloody synchronized improved police operations (Synchronized Enhanced Managing of Police Operations (SEMPO) 1 in December 2018 in the Guihulngan metropolis, Negros Oriental.\n </p>\n <p>\n  On January 17 at 1 p.m. 6.45 in the morning in brgy. Sag-Aang, La Castellana, victims Bernard Torres and Boy Baloy were abducted and then brutally killed by 62. IB soldiers. They were unarmed. More importantly, they were not members of the NPA, as opposed to the old Filipino army reports. In fact, there was no meeting between 62. Ib and NPA that day.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bernard Torres, from BRGY. Buenavista, Guihulngan metropolitan, was Habal-Habal driver and a member of Piston Guihulngan metropolitan department. Boy Baloy, an elderly man, was on the other hand farmer and native to Bry. Linantuyan, Guihulngan metropolis. Both have experienced harassment from the state power since 2017. They would have been part of the death toll for the Uplan Sauron 1 if they had not been able to flee with other families.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It is clear that the 3rd ID, 302 and 303. Brigades and the six battalions under their command here on Negros Island are making fake news. Their \"dismantled\" illusion is jeopardizing Negrosanon's life, especially farmers and country workers. They become more ruthless in their anti-rebellion campaign and are committing more and more human rights violations.\n </p>\n <p>\n  AFP's basis for declaring guerrilla fronts on Negro's island \"defeated\" is further from the truth. It knows the people on Negros Island well. The NPA is growing all the time and its mass base is elaborated due to the deteriorating semifeeudal and semicolonial system. AFP deserves the anger of the people because of their continuing focused military operations that create terror in the peasant communities, their defense of foreign interests and local large compressors and landlords, and the exploitation of the people for military corruption.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The armed revolution is a historical necessity and inevitable. While the American Marcos II regime continues its oppressive socio-economic politics and the spoon of its imperialist gentleman, the broad masses consisting mainly of peasants and workers have to fight against landlessness, poverty, low wages, job security, hunger, soaring prices and the absence of social benefits.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The 3rd ID is in deception and state terrorism to the neck. Ultimately, its \"dismantled\" illusion will become its downfall.\n </p>\n <h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center\">\n  <strong>\n   Fraudulent tactics behind the so -called \u203aFolk initiative '\n  </strong>\n </h3>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   January 25th\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">\n  <img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6552\" data-attachment-id=\"6552\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"billede-48\" data-large-file=\"https://socialistiskrevolution.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/billede-48.png?w=825\" data-medium-file=\"https://socialistiskrevolution.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/billede-48.png?w=300\" data-orig-file=\"https://socialistiskrevolution.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/billede-48.png\" data-orig-size=\"1024,576\" data-permalink=\"https://socialistiskrevolution.wordpress.com/2024/02/26/nyheder-om-folkekrigene-rundt-om-i-verden-26-02-2024/billede-48-7/\" height=\"464\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px\" src=\"https://socialistiskrevolution.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/billede-48.png?w=825\" srcset=\"https://socialistiskrevolution.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/billede-48.png?w=825\" width=\"825\"/>\n </figure>\n <p>\n  Red Commanders and Warriors from Roselyn Jean Pelle Commanded Norwegian Negros Guerrillaf front of the new folk army (RJPC-NPA) are alerted to the many reports of questionable plans to trick voting voters to sign the so-called \"People's Initiative\" (People's Initiative (PI)) To change the reactionary Filipino constitution of 1986.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Following further studies, RJPC-NPA units have concluded that citizens are deceived and forced to sign PI using the following ordinary empty promises or fictional reasons: Work offer under the TUPAD program, continuation and unchanged status of 4P recipients, petition that Press certain unnamed persons and 20 million PHP from Senator IMee Marcos, among others. Barangay officials and employees led the signature campaign in their respective areas through persistent house-to-house, group meetings or individual invitations. There was no discussion with the inhabitants about PI.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It is not surprising that several cities in northern Negros are in the top 10 above the largest number of signatures collected for PI. In these cities, residents are dependent on the monocultural sugar industry and suffer from uncertain jobs, miserable and unstable wages, get or no benefits and a standard of living from hand to mouth. It is easy to exploit the economic crisis because any solution to the immediate, worrying situation, just as false promises of the reactionary government's distribution financing project, are eagerly welcomed by people.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In addition, the cities of Sagay, Escalante and San Carlos as well as the city of Calatrava are now the subject of neoliberal programs to make room for solar parks, modular nuclear power plants, large water projects and economic zones. The local leaders of the cities mentioned mobilized their election campaign, including sitting officials and employees, and used misleading methods to collect a large number of signatures for PI to change the reactionary constitution to allow for foreign ownership of land and basic utilities.\n </p>\n <p>\n  While RJPC-NPA recognizes the right of the people to participate in the public initiative as a mechanism that allows citizens to demand reforms in the reactionary government, we condemn the misleading mechanisms to gather support for a PI that is left with the interests of foreign monopoly capital. On the other hand, RJPC-NPA praises a few mayors for their decision not to participate actively in such signature collections to PI and give the individual freedom to act (or not) in pi.\n </p>\n <p>\n  RJPC-NPA orders all units, including units from the people's militia and self-defense corps, to complete their study of the mechanisms behind the collection of signatures for PI, collect evidence, identify the main actors in this fraudulent signature collection and arrest persons taken on a fresh deed, to Interrogation and confiscate signature sheets as evidence and for further examination. Likewise, all revolutionary forces should reveal to the masses what the ultimate goal of this signature collection is, the people's initiative and the movement of charter changes.\n </p>\n <h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center\">\n  <strong>\n   The Old Philippine Army on Negros Island to protect the interests of the ruling and imperialism\n  </strong>\n </h3>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   February 16\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">\n  <img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6553\" data-attachment-id=\"6553\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"billede-49\" data-large-file=\"https://socialistiskrevolution.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/billede-49.png?w=825\" data-medium-file=\"https://socialistiskrevolution.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/billede-49.png?w=300\" data-orig-file=\"https://socialistiskrevolution.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/billede-49.png\" data-orig-size=\"1024,576\" data-permalink=\"https://socialistiskrevolution.wordpress.com/2024/02/26/nyheder-om-folkekrigene-rundt-om-i-verden-26-02-2024/billede-49-7/\" height=\"464\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px\" src=\"https://socialistiskrevolution.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/billede-49.png?w=825\" srcset=\"https://socialistiskrevolution.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/billede-49.png?w=825\" width=\"825\"/>\n </figure>\n <p>\n  Apolinario Gatmitan Command-new Folk Army Negros Island Regional Operations Command (AGC-NPA) strongly rejects the 3rd ID's claim that they have \"wound up\" as much as one guerrilla front on the island. Until now, all five guerrilla fronts under the AGC-NPA continue to act as the Filipin 'Communist Party's (PKP) primary weapon in the long-term People's War through extensive and intensive guerrilla warfare based on an ever-wider and deeper mass base in their respective areas of responsibility.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It is no surprise that the reactionary state troops will not be pulled out of Negro's island after the ancient Filipino Army's 3rd Infantry Division pretentious claimed that the guerrilla fronts at Negros were already defeated. It is also natural for the governor of Negros Occidental, Eugenio Lacson, to repeat that kind of talk as he represents the yields and oppressors on Negros Island, which the mercenaries of the 3rd ID earn.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The sustained presence of the reactionary Filipino armed forces (AFP) on the island reveals their rubbish about a 'degraded' front and reveals the anti-raising campaign as a fascist to a neoliberal target. In order to present a facade of a dissolved front, AFP, Filipino National Police (PNP) and National Working Group (NTF) -Elcac-a series of attacks through military offensives and psychological war and intelligence operations on peasant societies, hides countless human rights violations by declaring false meetings and false Surrender and promote corruption-affected and relief programs such as Barangay Development Program.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Religious focused military operations in Negros continue to result in several human rights violations, most recently the search of a peasant home of 15. Ib and 47. Ib in Cauayan, Negros Occidental. There are about 600 cases of human rights violations committed by reactionary state forces on Negros Island under the US-Marcos II regime, which is monitored by the National Democratic Front (NDF)-Negros involving over 39,000 victims.\n </p>\n <p>\n  After \u203adismantled {Statements and the recommendation to place Negros Island in a state of stable internal peace and security (stable internal Peace and Security (Sips)), bombarding reactionary propaganda machines the media with promises of\u203a Development 'and \"Progress\". The plan is obvious-to suppress disagreement in resource-rich societies to pave the way for the interests of multinational corporations and large comprades. AFP/PNP/NTF-ELCAC are merely tools and fighting dogs for the ruling class and their imperialist gentleman who want to throughout neoliberal projects such as destructive mining and quarry from northern to southern Negros, a commercial plantation in Candoni city, expansive land recovery projects that must transform Bacolod metropolitan and Dumaguete metropolis into 'super' and 'smart' cities, environmentally unfriendly water projects or mega dams in northern and southern central Negros and other forms of financial attacks against the people.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In reality, the reactionary state forces will stay on the island to protect the large compressors, landlords and bureaucratic capitalists such as Governor Lacson in collaboration with the imperialists. The reactionary state needs its armed machinery to draw a picture of security for the ruling class so that it can continue to exploit and suppress the Negrosanonic masses.\n </p>\n <p>\n  While fascism and neoliberalism continue, Negrosanons find justice in armed resistance. In this semi -colonial and semi -feudal society, they have suppressed and exploited every day to support and join the revolutionary movement. As long as the few rulers, the NPA and the Democratic Revolution of the People cannot be dismantled.\n </p>\n</div>\n", "source": "https://socialistiskrevolution.wordpress.com/2024/02/26/nyheder-om-folkekrigene-rundt-om-i-verden-26-02-2024/", "type": "article", "title": "News about the People's Wars around the World 26.02.2024", "description": "Peru masses rejection of the government is in full swing on February 5 We publish an unofficial translation of the following article.
