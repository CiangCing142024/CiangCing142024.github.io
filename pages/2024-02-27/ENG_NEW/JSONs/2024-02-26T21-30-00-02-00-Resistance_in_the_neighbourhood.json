To find a life that makes us, a life worth it!\n </p>\n <p>\n  Get up in the morning and know that you will go to work and come back!\n </p>\n <p>\n  Get up in the morning to go to your field and know that you will be able to live!\n </p>\n <p>\n  Get up in the morning and go to school, school and dream!\n </p>\n <p>\n  That is normal! The obvious!\n </p>\n <p>\n  And yet! If you go on an excursion, if you go to your parents for holidays, if you get on a train to go to find friends and girlfriends, in the 21st century Greece they will kill you along the way!\n </p>\n <p>\n  Therefore; What is the prospect of this system?\n </p>\n <p>\n  The challenge of the self -evident !!!!\n </p>\n <p>\n  This perspective doesn't make us! We want our own perspective! We want the obvious and even more and we will not be stuck!\n </p>\n <p>\n  We will go out and shout it, as students and peasants do! As the peoples of all over the world do!\n </p>\n <p>\n  On February 28, 1 year after the state murder in Tempi, to go to the streets and say we don't forget! To take to the streets and fight, for the lost brothers, to fight because we are right and we will win, to fight for the self -evident work, education, health!\n </p>\n <p>\n  Let's fight! Because in order to live we have to fight!\n </p>\n <p>\n  <b>\n   LA.\n  </b>\n </p>\n <div style=\"clear: both;\">\n </div>\n</div>\n", "description": "", "author": ["\u03a3\u03b1\u0390\u03c4\u03b1"], "labels": ["\u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03c8\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2", "\u039b.\u0391.", "\u03a4\u03b5\u03bc\u03c0\u03b7"], "source": "https://antigeitonies3.blogspot.com/2024/02/blog-post_45.html"}
