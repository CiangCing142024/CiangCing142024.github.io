Enough adjustment \u201d, had as a center the food claim for popular dining rooms, update of the amount of plans, increased retirement and the minimum vital and mobile salary, the delivery of school kits.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Thousands and thousands throughout the country expressed, in unity, the repudiation of social adjustment and exclusion policies.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The brutal devaluation that the National Government executed, added to the high inflationary indices, the tariffs and the cut to food assistance to dining rooms and picnings, has led the Argentine people to extreme poverty and favoring a handful of monopolies and landowners.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   In a country that produces food for millions, there are 27 million poor with almost 7 million homeless people who do not have for daily food, which increases with each measure against the people that the reactionary government takes, hunger and delivery of Milei.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The mobilizations and cuts developed in all provinces: Jujuy, Salta, Tucum\u00e1n, C\u00f3rdoba, Misiones, Chaco, Formosa, Corrientes, Entre R\u00edos, Santa Fe, Buenos Aires, Mendoza, San Juan, San Luis, La Rioja, La Pampa, Neuqu\u00e9n, R\u00edo Negro, Chubut, Tierra del Fuego.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   In\n   <strong>\n    CABA\n   </strong>\n   The mobilization of the set of organizations that make up the UTEP, the piquetera unit, workers and various organizations and movements marched to the Ministry of Human Capital claiming answers to the enormous needs of our people because hunger does not expect. The broad police operation to apply the Bullrich protocol I cannot prevent the massive mobilization.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <strong>\n    \"A gigantic step to face Milei's policy\"\n    <em>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   In radio statements of that day\n   <strong>\n    Juan Carlos Alderete\n   </strong>\n   , coordinator of the unemployed and precarious movement of the CCC, spoke of the day as a gigantic step to face Milei's policy.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \u201cToday is a very giant step forward of popular forces, social organizations. I remember that of 2001 where we had achieved this unit with all those who claimed at that time. And that unit has also made possible the unit with the middle class and that is why on January 27, 2001, \u201cPicket and saucepan was born, the fight is only one\u201d.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \u201cThis gigantic step will serve to face Javier Milei's policy, which has been more than 60 days. Milei and his henchmen are demonstrating that they are looters, that they want to take everything in the shortest possible time. We know the level of inflation and poverty that we have, and they publicly say the macabre plan that they intend to lower inflation based on demolishing everything, salaries, retirement and thus seek to liquidate consumption. That is called recession that we have already lived in 2001 and other crises but this is fierce. \u201d\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   In relation to hunger and the dining rooms Alderete said that \u201cin several provinces, I live in La Matanza, in what is Virrey del Pino, Gonz\u00e1lez Cat\u00e1n, there are already dining rooms with the poster \u00b4 there are no food 'because logically what we receive from donations Of the merchants and entrepreneurs in the area, who have been doing it for a long time, it is not enough. A huge sadness. The level of perversity of what the government does with people is incredible. And in those liar stories in which they talk about intermediation, food arrives directly to the dining rooms. We are asking to deliver food to the dining rooms, not a social leader, to continue feeding, people are desperate. The government believes it is an Excel payroll, don't you see what is happening? In that Excel form there are people who are suffering a lot. They will close the accounts but people cannot live like this. \u201d\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \u201cThe government celebrates because they lowered the deficit, we would have to celebrate that we arrived at the end of the month without feeding our children, without paying the light, the gas and without being able to send the boys to school. Let's face that. If time continues, they will leave a devastated country, without SMEs, without shops because the purchasing power has dropped so much that consumption will go down greatly. It is like in 2001: if they shout me too, if they come to hit me I am going to defend myself. Our country is at stake here. To Milei, who makes the madman, I want him to go wrong, because if he is doing well, he is a business policy that he has, it is not a government policy, it is a business plan that he does with the macro business caste that is in the government and that occupy important positions. The Minister of Economy is the one who borrowed us together with Macri and entire generations that have to pay the debt to the IMF, is a criminal because it allowed the capital escape of our country. What caste do they talk about? Casta turns out that they are the workers and the most down. \u201d\n  </p>\n  <p>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <strong>\n    Voices from the cuts in the country\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   From the cut in La Plata\n   <strong>\n    Ramiro joked,\n   </strong>\n   leader of the CCC, stated that \u201cthis day is part of the 500 route cuts throughout the country. It is to tell Patricia Bullrich that the antipiquete protocol will put it where it does not give him the light. And it shows the path we need because they want to make us believe that there is no money in the country. But here the 20 companies that produce 85% of food, financial capital, oil companies, landowners and the IMF remain the big beneficiaries of millions that are having a very bad time. In two months there are 3,200,000 new poor ones, they are numbers but in the day to day We have been able to buy neither the backpack nor the shoes. \u201d\n  </p>\n  <p>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   From one of the cuts in Rosario\n   <strong>\n    Eduardo Delmonte\n   </strong>\n   From the CCC declared that \u201cthis government was wanting to intimidate us with fear and getting into our homes to suffer in silence to those of social organizations. However, in a process the courage was more important that made us want to prevent our children from hungry and diseases to fear that they wanted to impose, and expresses itself here. This government came to destroy Argentina, not only impose hunger but to deliver the country. \u201d And he said that \u201cwe are touring a path together that does not have to be just this, it has to also be to support the light on the cacerolazos and multisectoral that allow us to make the framework of neighborhood unit per neighborhood, factory by factory, place I work, because that is ultimately unstoppable. \u201d He then referred to the struggles of December 20, of the cacerolazos when the DNU and the historic unemployment of January 24 were announced that told him outside the adjuster project of the Omnibus law and said that \u201cwith these cuts we show that it is possible to defend the democratic freedoms, which is possible to fight and that there will be no protocol that intimidates us. \u201d\n  </p>\n  <p>\n  </p>\n  <h5>\n   Photo: February 23, in CABA, at the Ministry of Human Capital\n  </h5>\n </div>\n <!-- .entry-content -->\n</div>\n", "source": "https://pcr.org.ar/nota/sostener-el-fueguito-encendido-de-los-cacerolazos-y-multisectoriales/", "type": "article", "title": "\"Sustain the fire on the cacerolazos and multisectoral\"", "description": "The call for innumerable organizations with the slogan \u201cThe food emergency cannot wait any longer.
