Law 4777 and the Law Framework strike the rights of students in public-dimensional studies bring tuition, deletions and disciplinarys, the secondment of professional rights from degrees. The policy of class barriers with the EBE and the Bank of themes throws students from universities and the law on technical education throws students from schools and makes them cheap, exploitable, without rights. They have submitted the bill that allows the establishment of private universities and will directly affect the rights of those who study in public with tuition, more intensification of our terms of study, more class barriers, abolition of trade unionism and fragmentation and degradation. They want to bring the national diploma that will mean nationwide for all 3 classes of high school.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <b>\n   Their attack should not pass!
