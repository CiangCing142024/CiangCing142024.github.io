   Bijapur District, February 27, 2024:
  </strong>
  Four cadres of the CPI (Maoist) were killed in separate encounters with security personnel in Chhattisgarhâ€™s Bijapur district on Tuesday, a senior police official announced to the press today.
 </p>
 <p class="no_first_intro_para">
  The two skirmishes took place in the forests between Bade Tungali and Chhote Tungali villages under the Jangla police station area, where separate teams of security personnel were out on an anti-Maoist operation, the official stated.
 </p>
 <div class="ev-meter-content ie-premium-content-block">
  <p>
   The operation was launched in the area on Monday based on intelligence inputs about the presence of Prashant, the platoon commander of company no. 2 of the West Bastar Division of the Maoist party, Matwara Local Organization Squad (LOS) commander Anil Punem and other high ranking Maoists, along with 40 to 50 members of the Bhairamgarh Area Committee of the CPI (Maoist), the official commented.
  </p>
  <p>
   Personnel from the District Reserve Guard (DRG) and Bastar Fighters (both units of the state police), and 80th and 231st battalions of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) were involved in the operation, the official remarked.
  </p>
  <p>
   The firefights occurred when one of the patrolling teams of the DRG was cordoning off the forest between Bade Tungali and Chhote Tungali villages, the official declared.
  </p>
  <p>
   Following the gun battles, the security forces recovered the bodies of four Maoists.
  </p>
  <p>
   The identity of the deceased Maoists was yet to be ascertained, the official said, adding that a search operation was still underway in the area.
