<strong>
    Women fights and defends you!
   </strong>
</span>
</br></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The class struggle rages all over the world. Wherever we look, we look at the wars, the genocide, the blood baths and massacre, which the imperialism sparks in the desperate attempt to escape its upcoming downfall. Imperialism, which brings wealth and prosperity to exploiters, the exploited poverty and misery is in a deep crisis that is fueled by the ongoing struggle of the peoples of the world that fight courageously and stubbornly against the yoke of their oppression. The face of this dying beast is currently particularly ugly in Palestine, where Yankee imperialism with its Israeli slaughtering-also supported by German imperialism! - drives the hideous genocide of the people of Palestine, which holds up the flag of resistance and defends with its blood. Even if the enemy is armed to the teeth and equipped with the latest technology, the people of Palestine are struggling with all the means available and proves that victory is with you every day. The role that the women of the people play - also within the national resistance front of the Palestine people - is by no means passive or to pure "support work", on the contrary, the women in our class and the people are in the front row and fight! The participation of women in the decades of heroic struggle of the people of Palestine has existed as long as this struggle itself and the rest of the world also looks no different; The best examples of this are the People's Wars in Peru, India, Turkey and in the Philippines. Wherever there is a fight, the women also get up and show that half of the sky belongs and they will conquer it!
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  In this country, too, the women in our class are suppressed twice - through imperialism and patriarchy - and are therefore also struggling for double reason. Each of us can feel that every day. We are forced to let ourselves be exploited at work under often miserable circumstances and at the same time should take care of child rearing and the household, not to mention relatives in need of care. Our bosses get full of the pockets, and if we and our class brothers no longer bring you profit, let us fall into unemployment or short -time work overnight and rob us of the last wages.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The bourgeois state does everything to maintain this state, after all, its own existence depends on it. It is therefore not surprising that we are the first to be invested by austerity measures, while the great money is invested in arms deliveries and upgrading so that the German state can secure its imperialist interests in the world, be it in Ukraine or in so -called "Middle East". After the government with Olaf Scholz at the top recently unconstitutional in the interest of the bourgeoisie money in the usual gangster manner, the billions now missing should be brought back in by savings in the event of social spending. As always, the load is invited to the shoulders of the working class. The planned cuts, e.g. in the citizens' allowance, particularly affect us women, after all, we still earn almost 20% less in the FRG than men, while we are almost ten times more single parent and therefore often dependent on corresponding financial supports. We have also been waiting for the promised "basic childcare" for over a year, but more than every fifth child in the FRG is still alive in poverty and no improvement is far and wide. It does not look better for childcare: Although every child is entitled to a daycare center by law from the age of one year, almost 400,000 places are missing throughout the FRG, and of course in the workers' districts. The few daycare centers that exist, as well as schools, Horts and other care facilities, are systematically understaffed, are saved and have been left out: Another factor that forces us in unemployment! The rulers are also too happy to save on our health: the already miserable health care of the entire working class, for us women there is also the immense breakdown of delivery rooms and birth stations, a huge lack of gynecologists and clinics that carry out abortions. And if we get the effects of the patriarchy, for example, through domestic violence, in most cases the perpetrator is not prosecuted, but the woman is simply deported to a women's shelter. And even that only if you are lucky, because, contrary to the bourgeois law, women's shelters are absolutely in short supply.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Everything the state gives us is empty promises. Every apparent improvement is nothing but bread crumbs that we are thrown from time to time so that we can hold our mouths. Because for us there can be no improvement within this rotted society. As long as imperialism exists, our exploitation and oppression by the patriarchy will also exist. One cannot be smashed without the other, because the basis of both is the same: private property. Only the combined struggle with our class brothers for a classless society can create the basis for our emancipation. To serve this goal, we need a class -conscious women's movement that is fighting for the reconstitution of the Communist Party of Germany and our actual emancipation!

  On "Defense Day" (formerly called session), it has always been the case that a potential conscript can be rejected on the basis of their BMI or height. The defense believes that these requirements are no longer 'time -consuming'.
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  The head of military service and recruitment in the Ministry of Defense's Personnel Board, Jesper Lynge, says that the change is due to the large number of unsuitable:
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
<em>
   "At present, we have a little more than 50 percent of young people who show up for Defense Day, who are declared unsuitable, and we think that is a big number."
  </em>
</p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  This new initiative comes in line with the already controversial initiative on doubling military service by that
  <a href="https://socialistiskrevolution.wordpress.com/2023/02/14/folketinget-mener-at-kvinder-skal-i-vaernepligt/">

  One who is clearly part of the general reactionary of the Danish bourgeois state. Both initiatives are angled from the defense and the Danish bourgeois media to be an initiative of progressive diversity. But people are not stupid.
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  All indications are that Denmark, and the imperialist countries in Europe in general, are getting ready to initiate new aggression wars. Sweden's defense manager, Michael Bydén, even stated directly, just under a month ago that the Swedish people should prepare for war. Similar statements have come from the military of Denmark and Norway.
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  Workers and progressive lots of all kinds must and must stand against the country's build -up, and oppose the imperialist initiative of a 'wider defense'. When imperialist mass murderers like Anders Fogh Rasmussen say that "the road to peace in Ukraine is through [imperial] war", it should ring alarm bells for any person who knows Fogh's bloody war in Iraq killing over half a million people.

<strong>
   Bijapur District, February 27, 2024:
  </strong>
  Four cadres of the CPI (Maoist) were killed in separate encounters with security personnel in Chhattisgarh’s Bijapur district on Tuesday, a senior police official announced to the press today.
 </p>
<p class="no_first_intro_para">
  The two skirmishes took place in the forests between Bade Tungali and Chhote Tungali villages under the Jangla police station area, where separate teams of security personnel were out on an anti-Maoist operation, the official stated.
 </p>
<div class="ev-meter-content ie-premium-content-block">
<p>
   The operation was launched in the area on Monday based on intelligence inputs about the presence of Prashant, the platoon commander of company no. 2 of the West Bastar Division of the Maoist party, Matwara Local Organization Squad (LOS) commander Anil Punem and other high ranking Maoists, along with 40 to 50 members of the Bhairamgarh Area Committee of the CPI (Maoist), the official commented.
  </p>
<p>
   Personnel from the District Reserve Guard (DRG) and Bastar Fighters (both units of the state police), and 80th and 231st battalions of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) were involved in the operation, the official remarked.
  </p>
<p>
   The firefights occurred when one of the patrolling teams of the DRG was cordoning off the forest between Bade Tungali and Chhote Tungali villages, the official declared.
  </p>
<p>
   Following the gun battles, the security forces recovered the bodies of four Maoists.
  </p>
<p>
   The identity of the deceased Maoists was yet to be ascertained, the official said, adding that a search operation was still underway in the area.

For many years she prepared the pedagogical aspects of the new education system, because the task was, as she said: «Destroy the old class school that behaved scandalous injustices, and create a school that responded to the needs (...) of the recent socialist regime », Hence the organization of education became a task of the entire people: Popular Education Councils were created everywhere and in schools committees of parents of students were organized. And to the teachers the comrade Krupskaya told them: «The popular teacher is closer to the popular environment and, in many cases, is linked to that medium by thousands of ties; The dividing line between the teaching profession and the people had drawn artificially with a specific objective. The new conditions are suppressing this division and we must create modalities of collaboration between the teachers and the population, which end this anti -Natural Division (…). In this approach is the guarantee of the prosperity of the school, which increases the cultural level of the country thanks to everyone's intense work, and a better future; The promise of the Renaissance of the teaching whose function can now be honored and respected ».
  </p>
<p>
   In addition to all this, Krupskaya was editor of the magazine
   <em>
    Towards a new life
   </em>
   ; And for those years she was elected delegate to all the congresses of the party, a member of her guiding bodies and deputy in the main bodies of power.
  </p>
<p>
   Comrade Krupskaya was also a great promoter of libraries, in 1918, thanks to its initiative the first seminar of the Soviet Library in Moscow was created, more than 20 library departments were opened in the Russian Institutes of Political Education, Pedagogy Institutes and in the academies of communist education. Krupskaya considered literacy and access to books as instruments in the socialist struggle, there Private of more than 500 copies were confiscated, nationalized and stored in the new libraries, the individual property of the books became collective.

<p>
   Krupskaya was also convinced that: "We cannot continue to develop economically and culturally without end The eradication of illiteracy of the population from 8 to 50 years, in 1920 the Extraordinary National Commission for the eradication of illiteracy was created, in 1923 the voluntary society was created below illiteracy, with the slogan «alphabets, instruct the illiterate! », In 1925 the general, free and mandatory primary education began to apply; In 1928 books were published in 70 languages of the peoples of the USSR, and in 1934 in 104 languages. Thus, although at the beginning of the twentieth century, almost 80 % of the Russian population (between 8 and 50 years old) was illiterate and 60 % of the population had not completed basic education, by 1930 that percentage had decreased to 33 %, The revolution created education centers for all levels and - between 1920 and 1940 - achieved 60 million adults literacy.
  </p>
<p>
   In 1918 he published the article
   <em>
    On the question of the Socialist School
   </em>
   , in which he pointed out the sense of socialist education: «Train multilaterally developed people, with conscious and organized social predispositions, that have a reflexive, comprehensive world vision and that clearly understand everything that is happening around them in nature and in social life; people prepared in theory and practice for all types of work, both physical and mental; People capable of building a rational social life, full of content, beautiful and cheerful. These people are necessary for socialist society, without them socialism cannot be fully realized ».
  </p>
<p>
   Krupskaya wrote more than 3000 publications between books, magazines, articles and pamphlets, especially about the formation of youth and communist education that should be secular, universal, free and mandatory for all, include both sexes, with an organization Democratic where there was a broad participation of the population in the election of school committees, with full freedom of opinion and with the right to receive education in their native language.
  </p>
<p>
   In 1919, Krupskaya, along with other comrades, created the
   <em>
    UnotDel
   </em>
   , an apartment that worked to improve the living conditions of women in the educational field, in their rights in marriage and at work. From this organization the publication of the feminist newspaper was promoted
   <em>
    Communist
   </em>
   , where it was written about the situation of women and their rights.
  </p>
<p>
   The
   <em>
    UnotDel
   </em>
   And his press allowed the first years after the Russian revolution, witness the great achievements in matters such as sexual diversity and women's rights. Before the revolution, according to Krupskaya's words: "Family life was based on slavery: children were owned by parents, and the woman, of the husband", but that situation surpassed the laws established by Soviet legislation: The punishment to homosexuality was eliminated, women had the right to vote and to be candidates, the right to divorce was facilitated and automatically granted, there was access to universal and free education, equal salary between men and women, aids to relieve loads Family members and the right to free and free abortion, it was established that the sons and daughters inside or outside the marriage had the same rights, the maternity leave was guaranteed, more rights were granted to women at work and the equality of the equality of the spouses in relation to sons and daughters. Surprising achievements for the time and that constituted a great advance in the struggle of the female movement.

<p>
   For Krupskaya, the long hours of women of women in the factory had as its main consequence that many children grow in the streets, and in some cases, mothers, without capacity or time to educate them, decided to intern their children in orphanages in orphanages . It was necessary to end the exploitation of working women and that society guarantees the education and food of childhood. That is why kinds of childhood were created that would allow women to go to work with the certainty that their children would be well cared for and fed. In addition, the education that children would receive in public school would take as a basis for the importance of productive, creative and multilateral work.
  </p>
<p>
   After Lenin's death, which occurred in 1924, Krupskaya dedicated much of his time to edit the work of his late husband. Because of the importance that the comrade had in the preparation and execution of the proletarian revolution, for its work in favor of socialism, several distinctions were granted: in 1929, the red flag of work; In 1931, he was appointed honorary member of the Ursss Academy of Sciences and, in 1933, the Order of Lenin was granted. In 1933 he published his memoir
   <em>
    My life with Lenin
   </em>
   And since 1937, Krupskaya was a member of the presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR.
  </p>
<p>
   On February 27, 1939, he died in Moscow, the day after he was 70 years old. His ashes were deposited with Lenin in his mausoleum and Comrade Stalin presided over his burial. The outstanding achievements in the field of literacy led to, in 1970, the Imperialist UNESCO appointed Nadezhda Krupskaya to her annual merit award in the fight against illiteracy.
  </p>
<p>
   The thought and actions of communist women like Nadezhda Constantínovna Krupskaya marked true milestones in the historical struggle of the women's labor movement. The best tribute that we can give to the comrade is the application of their ideas, its struggle around the female movement and for public education and quality for the people. In their tribute today women continue to march for the organization of the revolutionary party in all countries and for the construction of the communist international, which leads the world proletariat to take the sky by assault.

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">
<span>
    A 
 Country where the Police Manganella Students who manifest 
 democratically dissent and the government says "they did well", 
 It is a country in danger.
   </span>
</span>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">
<span>
    We had it 
 Already said that with the Caivano decree and the cd. New “Package 
 security ”, the repressive turning point was already underway, because when 
 A country deals with social issues such as issues of public order 
 It is never a good sign. And in fact, for ten years now, 
 never so many minors in prisons, in some institutes it is feared 
 even the juvenile overcrowding. The entrances to the IPM are 
 increasing and growth of attendance is given almost entirely from 
 girls and boys for which the precautionary measure was arranged 
 pursuant to the new "Caivano" legislation.
   </span>
</span>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">
<span>
    But 
 a country that falls into the punitive temptation towards those who commit a 
 crime in such a crucial phase of its growth path has 
 chosen to abound the boys and take the path of the 
 pure and simple repression.
   </span>
</span>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">
<span>
    As 
 Yesterday, very young students in Pisa manifest by asking for the “Cassate 
 the fire ”in Palestine and of
    <span>
</span>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<a name="more">
</a>
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">
<span>
   against they suffer a violent, 
 unjustified, illegitimate charge by the police who there 
 Manganella with unprecedented and anti -democratic fury, some handcuffed 
 face down or with a bloody face.
   <br>
</br></span>
</span>
<p>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">
<span>
    Not 
 It is an isolated case. The demonstrators under the Rai offices were also 
 attacked by the police. The anti-sung procession in Bologna, kicks and 
 Manganelli on the protesters.
   </span>
</span>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">
<span>
    The 
 tensions in the country are growing rapidly and just to season again 
 more the repressive dish, representatives of the government defend, 
 they justify and legitimize police behavior pointing out 
 Students as "disorder professionals".
   </span>
</span>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">
<span>
    In 
 reality these words only serve to discourage the square, a 
 repress dissent, to compress democracy and to justify the 
 violent arm of the state.
   </span>
</span>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">
<span>
    From 
 That "You've been you, with your stone" pronounced by the deputy chief 
 Lauro after the killing of Carlo Giuliani by the state 
 During the G8, to date it seems terribly not to have changed 
 Nothing.
   </span>
</span>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">
<span>
    That 
 which happened yesterday is an abuse that falls on demonstrators 
 very young in defense of the Palestinian people. Another 2001 is 
 unacceptable.
   </span>
</span>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">
<span>
    The 
 dissent is the essence of democracy while the batons, i 
 beating and repression are abuse of power and repression does not 
 It must become normal. The square does not stop!

    Another article published in June 2023 during the first announcement of this “pantheonization”.
   </em>
</br></p>
<p>
   In a few hours Missak Manouchian and his wife Mélinée will be buried in the Pantheon, a Parisian monument where the "figures of the history of France" rest.
   <br>
   Missak and her twenty-three comrades, Jews, Spanish republicans, stateless have not just fought for France "they fought against Hitler's fascism like all the resistance fighters but have this central feature of being all communist activists who have Makes the greatest sacrifice, the highest by giving their lives for the people.
   <br>
   Missak and his comrades prepared the field, pouring their blood as tens of thousands of members of the Glorious Communist Party of France, for the conquest of social achievements of 1945, retirement or social security.
  </br></br></p>
<p>
   What an unignable hypocrisy when you know with what violence and determination the bourgeoisie attacked these great conquests paid by blood among other things of the red poster.
   <br>
   This hypocrisy always reveals his infamy more when he was made public than Marine Le Pen, leader of the RN, was invited to this ceremony, despite being the daughter of the torture of the Algerian people Jean-Marie Le Pen, founder FN. The FN was founded by a clique of collaborators, vichyst militiamen, ex-Petainist, members of the Waffen SS, the Charlemagne division etc.
   <br>
   Thus, the presence of the direct heirs of their executioners are accepted to communist resistance fighters.
  </br></br></p>
<p>
   This scandal reaches its peak when you know that the last resistance fighters FTP-me (snipers and supporters, immigrant labor) were not invited to the ceremony, their request for participation having received an end of non-non back.
   <br>
   This is the case notably of Léon Landini, a figure of the Communist Resistance of Lyon which denounces with fury the contempt of the French State which knowingly ignored its invitation request for the tribute.
   <em>
    (Editor's note = after an outcry aroused by this news, Léon Landini received an invitation less than 48 hours before the tribute)
   </em>
</br></p>
<p>
<strong>
    Why does the bourgeoisie organize this event now?
   </strong>
<br/>
   There is obviously a strong political dimension behind this pantheonization, we barely emerge from an ultra-reactionary anti-immigration law and the reactionnarization state seeks to hide the deep crisis of the capitalist system by designating as responsible for the people's misfortunes Immigrants, we try to demonstrate that there are good immigrants, patriots, workers and who do not make waves; And bad immigrants, parasitic Islamized immigrants.
   <br/>
   If Macron talks about Missak Manouchian 80 years after his death, it is to respond to her political drawings, to give an example of a "good assimilated immigrant", the communist commitment of Manouchian being obviously at best vaguely mentioned in the subsex .
  </p>
<p>
   Macron and his clique have nothing to do with Missak Manouchian and the red poster. They only think by political calculation, as with the interview in the revisionist tea towel that has become humanity during which the P'C'f offers an open forum in Macron in which it should not be said Leave the "fight against illegal immigration to the far right". Recall that illegal immigration has nevertheless seen the vast majority of fighters in the red poster.
   <br/>
   This tribute is only an insult, a provocation, a spit made by the bourgeoisie on the grave of the heroes of the resistance.
  </p>
<p>
   Missak and her comrades have no place in a bourgeoisie pantheon, their bodies have nothing to do alongside those of Napoleonic marshals or Jean Monnet: Missak, Mélinée and the others have devoted their lives to shoot down the bourgeoisie, to organize the socialist revolution. The memory of our comrades will not be honored through a ceremony projected on the television channels of bourgeois media monopolies, they are honored on a daily basis by the proletarian youth of France, their names resonate in the updates of June and in the daily actions of the worthy heirs of the youth battalions.
  </p>
<p>
   Missak, the glorious fighters of the red poster and all the others live in the ardent struggle of the French proletariat, so let's never leave the bodies of our comrades flouted by the worst reactionaries!
  </p>
<p>
   80 years later we remember the sacrifice of our comrades and we always raise the red flag of those who were "
   <em>
    Lovers to live to die from it ”,
   </em>
   We assert with certainty that their bodies will rest in socialist France sooner or later for which they gave their lives.

 crazy. About four days ago 800 bags of flour arrived

 amount. I spent three hours in the morning to light the fire and 
 Cooking the dough, but the final result was not good. Era 
 Hard, raw and had a strange flavor. My sister started a

  Gaza is at the limit of forces. The situation is 
 Very serious and things worsen day by day. We are beyond the 
 famine. In recent months I have become so fragile. I was a boy 
 healthy, I went on horseback and ran. Now I can't even go up the 
 stairs without feeling exhausted. I completely forgot what flavor 
 They have foods like fruit or chicken. Until a few days ago we only had 
 Rice, and even that is now scarce. If you can find, a 
 kilo of rice costs 80 shekel (20 €), while before the war 
 It was worth 7 shekel (€ 1.80). We are finishing basic foods like oil 
 Kitchen, yeast, corn and barley. Also food for animals, which 
 We have often been forced to eat, it is almost totally 
 disappeared. Something ends every day. I know people who have 
 started eating wild herbs. If we remain like this for another 
 week, I think we will start seeing people with hungry in 
 mass. One thing is certain: there is nothing more in Gaza. People 
 Sane they get sick, the sick ones die. It doesn't matter if you have money or 
 No, if you have stored more food from the beginning of the war or not. 
 Everything is over, we cannot go around, we are all in the 
 same situation. Dying for bombs is better than starving. 
 At least with the air attacks you leave immediately. We are continuing to 
 turn and turn every day, just to find the bite you keep 
 standing.

    (by living and remotely)
   </span>

</p>
<p>
  We denounce the unacceptable decision to start the Educational Procedure by Living in Clinics and through e -learning in preclinical years, while the School is under occupation for the 5th week.
  <b>
   SPIA, with mass general assemblies for several weeks, has been on a racing track along with dozens of other student clubs, against the bill on the establishment of private universities.
  </b>
  The decisions of our General Assemblies from the first week include the occupation of the School as a medium of struggle, as in most schools.
 </p>
<p>
  Terrorism that has been unfolded against occupations is unprecedented, since not only has prosecution ordered a prosecution against them, but has been attempted
  <b>
   evacuating two schools that were under occupation
  </b>
  (Legal DUTH and AUTH), invasion of police in a number of other institutions (see NTUA or Rector), threats to disciplinary and persecution against students.
 </p>
<p>
  But as Bourdoulas is exhausted, the government also recruits other mechanisms, less "scary" but with enormous repressive power as it has already been shown. The main "enemy" of the occupations and assemblies have been the tele-examination in recent weeks.
  <b>
   It did not start and the massive assemblies fell sharply nationwide, proving its role as a "television".
  </b>
  With clubs making basic decisions condemning the tele-examination as a means of undermining our struggle, but half-time with their treatment
  <b>
   (The refusal of adopting the request for mass abstinence from the rest of the left has given our decisions "short legs")
  </b>
  , the tele-examinations could not be hindered.
 </p>
<p>
  However, the assemblies continued to become (with reduced mass) and make race decisions. So another mechanism was activated in the Ministry's circular on tele-extensions:
  <b>
   Start of the new semester remotely.
  </b>
  The repressive role of tele-education is highlighted in all its glory. Since the students were not upset with a series of threats, they were put in the most blackmailing way to leave the struggles and go to their lessons.
 </p>
<p>
  Specifically, the administration of the Medical School has begun by making an arbitrary announcement, opposed to the decision of the Association to continue the occupation, where it informed that, regardless of the decision, the 6th year lessons will normally begin on 19/02 "in an attempt to keep it. binding date for issuance of study. " He thus excluded the 6th year of the decisions of the Association's General Assembly and forced him to return to his clinics and ignore the occupation. Following this and after the unacceptable intervention of the DAP-NDFK, which demanded the administration to reopen the courses, contrasting to the assembly decision, the re-establishment was announced for all other years, with the "excuse" of pressure on a joint date for a joint date. Coast goes for a walk.
 </p>
<p>
<b>
   It is clear that this is not a movement of "facilitating" students, but a direct detachment of the club's decisions and undermining the struggle it gives for weeks.
  </b>
  Threats of missing semesters are already emerging, holidays, weekends, afternoons, extensions until August. How do they do our own interest to make a decision against that of the Association, to blackmail us with the "13 weeks of compulsory courses" put by the Law of Diamantopoulou, with replacements that will make our daily lives inhumane and lost with lost Semester as a "sacrifice" for the struggle we give?
 </p>
<p>
<b>
   The Association must adopt a steady attitude: not in tele-educated- tele-ending, no lost semester, not in replacements for the lessons lost in the occupation!
  </b>
  As when he opposed the tele-examination, he also qualified for the request for a second examination in the second year after the end of the mobilizations, ensuring that no one loses his examination, so do
  <b>
   Time must demand that any educational process be stopped and not to be lost in the six months so that students can participate and massive their collective processes without distractions.
  </b>
  The Association has also ignored other reactionary laws, such as limiting the examination period to 3 weeks or the abolition of undergraduate. He should not take a step behind his claims but also to ascertain the reactionary framework of the 13 weeks of courses that are particularly employed against the occupations. Through our general assemblies, to ensure that there is nothing more obstacle to our struggles until the victory: the withdrawal of the bill that crushes the popular right into public - free studies!

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Two years after the outbreak of the
  <i>
   guerra
  </i>
<i>
   for Prosecutor
  </i>
  between Russian imperialism and US/born imperialism and 
 of the European Union, Ukraine continues to be the vehicle, the
  <i>
   pawn 
 interested
  </i>
  to the division of the booty that can come from the clash between the 
 Imperialist countries, in fact, which must give an outlet to the economic crisis 
 world through the conquest of the markets, to guarantee the continuation of 
 enormous profits necessary for the survival of the capitalist-imperialist bourgeois system.
  <o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<o:p>
</o:p>
  On February 24, in fact, i 
 representatives of the various imperialist countries gathered once again in 
 Ukraine, with the Meloni warflower in the front row because currently at 
 Presidency of the G7 shift. The ceremonies for the two years of war have started 
 Yesterday at Antonov airport, where Meloni did not miss the opportunity to tell 
 Bales and propaganda on the "nation" ...
 </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  "The goal" of the initiative, he comments 
 An article of yesterday's manifesto, “while the third year of war begins, is 
 say aloud that
  <u>
   The allies do not abandon Ukraine
  </u>
  "." Given the 
 continuous complaints of Zelenskj. But since the aforementioned offensive of 
 Spring of the Nazi Zelenskj did not succeed, on the contrary, saw the advance of the 
 Russi, then "nobody is safer on the future of events". Well yes 
 they also extend the times for the adhesion of Ukraine to the EU, despite the 
 Promises: "Pacified Ukraine will be part of the EU" said the president 
 of the European Commission with the helmet von der Leyen. " When it will be part of the 
 EU exactly does not know, in the meantime you can continue to destroy, 
 In short, the war can continue on all the land by putting on the field 
 Other "aid": “On the 88 billion of EU financing paid so far, 28 are 
 military assistance states and 5 others are provided for the assistance fund 
 common, for the purchase of weapons and ammunition, in addition to the training of 60 thousand 
 Ukrainian soldiers. "
  <o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  The words used by the impassive 
 representatives of imperialism - against the background of thousands of deaths - 
 However, they remain vague on the direct explicit commitment regarding the war. 
 These bilateral agreements, as the Manifesto writes, "involve a" guarantee 
 security »", and what does it mean? It is “a commitment to intervene to 
 Support of Ukraine beyond what has been done so far? It's a 
 replacement of article 5 of NATO "which provides for the entry into the war if a 
 Is it attacked ally? But “the EU is well careful not to go beyond the line 
 Red that could drag the block into a state of "co-co-belligorate" ".
 </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Therefore, what they really consist of 
 These bilateral agreements - while pushing towards a generalized enlargement 
 of the war - that Meloni for Italy also, as they had before they did great 
 Brittany, Germany, France, Denmark and Canada, signed in the building 
 Mariinsky?
 </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  "The Italian agreement explained 
 Meloni, it concerns
  <b>
   Industrial cooperation
  </b>
  , the exchanges of the services of 
 intelligence on cyber attacks,
  <b>
   support for reforms
  </b>
  ,
  <b>
   humanitarian
  </b>
  ,
  <b>
   later the reconstruction. "
  </b>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  And in the end he concludes with a sentence 
 Effect: "Italy provides" unpublished and strengthened collaboration in case 
 of future attack »." It is a phrase that does not mean anything, since 
 What was to be said on this occasion was said by any 
 representative of the imperialist bourgeoisie present, if not that
  <b>
   will increase 
 Aid in cash, in arms and in military training.
  </b>

  The counterrevolutionary offensive of the Armed Forces High Command (ACFA), which is turned nine, lost the initiative after the disastrous rod of January 8, 2023, the further now with the advancement of investigations. The Armed Forces lost much of the “legitimacy” that so much were arident to possess due to their achievements during the Bolsonaro government, in fact criminal harm to the people and the nation, because they came to light many of their scammer conspiracy. In addition, his image of “holy and pure” institution, “incorruptible”, had already crumbled, when monthly complaints of overpricing arose in his supply, brutal inequality of the squares and low officers compared to the high office, not to mention The willful administration of the Covid-19 pandemic. But why has the counter -revolutionary offensive of the ACFA has more unfavorable ground?
 </p>
<p>
  When the then army commander Eduardo Villas-Bôas (representative of the hegemonic right in the ACFA) said in 2017 that “
  <em>
   The Armed Forces must be silent protagonists so that society knows that the crisis will not exceed certain limits
  </em>
  ”And launched the consignments of“
  <em>
   legitimacy, stability, legality
  </em>
  ”Was establishing a military intervention plan. All the concerns and scenarios thought by the ACFA were centered on two aspects: on the one hand, it was necessary to centralize reactionary institutions by making them work under a unique reactionary plan formulated by them, to face a scenario of popular upheaval; On the other hand, it was necessary to submit such institutions as much as possible, without shocking the legal order, without seeming a military coup, not to generate a resistance of the majority of society and even from other institutions, which would eventually lose space in political power. It was the Armed Forces Intervention Plan in National Political Life to prevent the worsening of the revolutionary situation, which had again developed from the 2013-14 popular uprisings. In this plan, an institutional rupture would only be justifiable in the latter case; Or, in the words of Villas-Bôas and other so-called “legalistic generals” (read, the hegemonic right in the ACFA): the institutional rupture would only be in case of what it calls for “social crisis”, to safeguard the “constituted powers” . A disguised blow, in short, that would only come out of the disguise in the extreme case.
 </p>
<p>
  The movements of the far-right Bolsonarist, seeking to dispute the direction of the counterrevolutionary offensive and precipitate the institutional rupture, generated such a situation that today the reactionary armed forces were again unmasked as essentially coup. Investigations publicly brought all the rottenness of the Armed Forces, all the elements of the coup preparations, showing that - yes - Brazil has been to a wire to return to a military regime, whatever its outcome, and that this is not “ from past".
 </p>
<p>
  Let's look at the practical result of the ACFA right plane. This, which intended to conduct military intervention gradually to remove from the Supreme Court what it considered an excess of power, today is investigated by a much more strengthened STF, which concentrates more functions than before. Congress, which according to the ACFA plan should have less power and functions, today has control not only about the country's political agenda, but of the most important part of the budget itself; Congress has never been so powerful. Today, culminating military intervention with the closure of the regime by force to try to combat a popular or revolutionary survey will produce a ten -time resistance of various segments of society, including right and reactionaries; A military coup “to safeguard the constituted powers” is much less justifiable today than it was in 2017, even to the traditional right. All institutions, which according to the plane of the ACFA should be centralized, have become even more ambitious in its Pugna by political power: the STF “run over” Congress and it wants to submit to itself the STF; The Chamber of Deputies “run over” Federal Senate; The National Congress controls the federal government etc. Consequently, the political crises, the tendency to the system of government, the unmasking of political characters in the masses and the growth of the discredit of the institutions, in front of the people grow, the tendency of the people. It all leads to the intensification of the struggle between the classes, the worsening of the revolutionary situation that ACFA, in 2015, intended to placate, when his offensive offensive disgusting preventive.
 </p>
<p>
  Despite maintaining a high vigilance against coup - as it is not defeated strategically, it is not even conjured in the short term - it must be recognized that the path to military intervention is more unfavorable. To “turn the table”, the Generals of the High Command will have to pay much more expensive than they would pay, for example, in 2017. This is the main one. There is no doubt that the situation for the popular and revolutionary struggle has become even more favorable.

   This Sunday, February 25, the cause of the people called for commemorating the heroes of the French proletariat. As every year, this commemorative demonstration aimed to honor Pierre Overney, revolutionary worker, seller of the cause of the people. On February 25, 1972, when Pierrot had the hard experience of forced unemployment, fired from Renault for political reasons, he participated in a leaflet distributions in front of the factory to commemorate the 10 years of the massacre of the Charonne metro, a Demonstration which followed the massacre of October 17, 1961 where the French police drowned the Algerians en masse. Following his death, class solidarity is immense, and more than 200,000 people walk in a long procession behind his coffin in early March 1972.

   We also paid a special tribute to the heroes of the Manouchian group (FTP-Moi), giving their lives for the Communist Party and the Revolution 80 years ago. In addition to a speech, two letters were read to the comrades present. The first is made up of extracts from Missak Manouchian's letter to Mélinée, his wife, before her death. She demonstrates all her internationalism and heroism. The second is a letter from the Bulgarian worker Lutibrodsky, sentenced to death by the dictatorship in 1934, to his father. This letter was broadcast to thousands of copies at the time as an example of the relentless struggle against the bourgeoisie and fascism. The demonstration, starting from the Metro Père Lachaise, therefore passed on the tomb of Pierrot, then that of Szlama Grzywacz, communist fighter, Polish Jew member of the Manouchian group, died shot on February 21, 1944.

   Here we publish the photos of the event, which attracted the attention and sympathy of the passers -by and employees of Father Lachaise, mobilizing many sympathizers of our newspaper. We will soon publish the speech and the letters that were read on this occasion.

<p>
   Comrades and friends!
  </p>
<p>
   The cause of the people warmly thanks you for your presence this morning to Father Lachaise to commemorate the heroes of the proletariat. With our red flags lifted high and our revolutionary enthusiasm, we constantly recall that they have not fallen for nothing.
  </p>
<p>
   Who are they, these heroes of the past whose memory we recall today?
  </p>
<p>
   The Manouchian group was active at the time of resistance against the fascist-Nazie occupation and for the defense of the USSR. They were part of the Smarts-Tirers-Immigrant Labor (FTP ME) of the Paris region, under the direction of the Communist Party of France on the Order of the Communist International, which led relentless attacks against the forces armies of the occupier. Their life was made of hiding, spinning, hideouts, assassinations of SS.
  </p>
<p>
   The infamous "Red Poster", plastered by the Nazis and collaborators of the anti-Bolshevik action committee against the FTP-Moi, shows the blue fear that resistance actions caused in fascists!
  </p>

   Manouchian and Celestino Alfonso challenged the fascists until the last moment, refusing to have blindfolded to die in the sun. As the poem says, "death does not dazzle the eyes of supporters".
  </p>
<p>
   Comrades and friends!
  </p>
<p>
   The 23 members of the Manouchian group were of a myriads of nationalities. However, they all fell here! This is the most radiant proof of proletarian internationalism, because the proletariat represents a unique class around the world. They are not only heroes for the French proletariat, but for the entire international proletariat!
  </p>
<p>
   The reactionary government of Emmanuel Macron may try to grasp the memory of Manouchian, by incorporating him hypocritically into the pantheon, he cannot dirty his name! It is because Manouchian flies higher than national recognition, that the false bourgeois commemorations! His comrades and overlooking him with all their greatness the narrowness of mind of the bourgeoisie, who cannot understand why proletarians would die, far from home, for the national liberation and the social emancipation of the working class. But we, comrades and friends, we understand! Already during the commune of Paris, the heroes of the incendiary streets of the capital were called Varlin, but also Dombrovsky, Dmitrieff or Frankel! The Manouchian group has given its life for the party and the revolution, and that, we will never forget it!
  </p>
<p>
   Comrades and friends!
  </p>
<p>
   Pierre Overney was a young worker barely 23 years old, younger than many of us here. Entering the proletarian left, the most combative anti-visionist organization of the time, it was one of those hundreds of workers' activists installed in the factory to get agitation in the 1970s.
  </p>
<p>
   On February 25, 1972, when Pierrot had the hard experience of forced unemployment, fired from Renault for political reasons, he participated in a leaflet distributions in front of the factory to commemorate the 10 years of the massacre of the Charonne metro, a Demonstration which followed the massacre of October 17, 1961 where the French police drowned the Algerians en masse.
  </p>
<p>
   During this action, Tramoni, an ex-parachutist of the Criminal Massu during the Algerian War, who made the employers' militia for Renault, released his weapon and fell the young activist in front of the gates. Class solidarity with Overney is immense, and more than 200,000 people walk in a long procession behind his coffin in early March 1972. It was the first time that such a mobilization under the red flags took place outside the claws of Revisionist party.
  </p>
<p>
   Tramoni was tried but quickly released in 1974. It was in 1977 that a motorcycle commando descended him in the name of justice for Pierre Overney.
  </p>
<p>
   Pierrot came from a family of poor agricultural workers. With his round glasses and his guy smile, he became a hero of the proletariat by going as close as possible to the working class; By defying employer threats and finally, by falling for the cause of the people.
  </p>
<p>
   Pierrot, like Gilles Tautin, like our comrade Pierre who relaunched the cause of the people in the 2010s, was not afraid to swim against the tide. Between the current of Gaullist reactionaries, against the current of revisionists and opportunists like Georges Marchais, secretary general of the PCF, who will dare to attack his memory when his corpse was still hot and the impact of the ball still hot!
  </p>
<p>
   Comrades and friends!
  </p>
<p>
   Who can ignore the example of Pierrot? Person ! Even today, revolutionaries and rebels risk prison for their ideas and actions. Let us remember that the cries of revolt that followed the death of the young Nahel last summer only found a response a massive imprisonment. In Europe, in 2021, the police shot real bullets on demonstrators. Just last year in France, during the Battle of Holy Soline, the weapons used by the repression forces been made to hurt and to kill, as demonstrated by Serge, which remained a month in coma And six weeks in intensive care.
  </p>
<p>
   But the repression of the bourgeois state is not proof of its strength! If Pierrot fell under the bullets of the bosses, it is because they felt the wind get up; A wind that made everyone tremble. This is why they had armed guard dogs like Tramoni, that's why they arm the cops to the teeth today! Because this wind rises again, and as the song says, "beware of revenge, when all the poor is getting there! ».
  </p>
<p>
   Comrades and friends!
  </p>
<p>
   Is the story of the heroes of the proletariat written in the past?
  </p>
<p>
   Of course not. We have spoken in this speech exceptional acts of some of the immortals whose memory we celebrate. They are immortal because they continue to live through us.
  </p>
<p>
   But the history of the heroes of the proletariat, from Parisians on the days of June 1848 and until today, it is not the story of a few proper names, of some incredible individuals that cannot be equaled.
  </p>
<p>
   It is above all a collective story, that of women and men who gave their lives for an immense cause, the greatest that is, who accepted a huge sacrifice with the true certainty that the struggle would not cease with them , but that they served it as best they could. And they were right! So, comrades and friends, let's not be intimidated by their example, do not live in the past, but let's look to the future and try to lead our lives in the same way as them.
  </p>
<p>
   Their looks, the features of their faces, their stature; All this may be engraved in our memories, their particularities to everyone are very little compared to the universal message they carry. Their example goes beyond their own figure, it exceeds their time and it goes far beyond this cemetery where we are. He is alive in each of us present here, but also among all those who continue the struggle today around the world. The heirs of the Manouchian and Pierre Overney group are in the large towers of the districts, in the countryside and mountains of Latin America, in the hills of Turkey, in the forests and the jungles of India and the Philippines, wherever wherever The people in struggle raise their heads and affirmed loud and clear: "We are right to revolt! »»

   In the appendix, comrades and friends, we would like to read you two letters. The first is made up of extracts from Missak Manouchian's letter to Mélinée, his wife, before her death. She demonstrates all her internationalism and heroism. The second is a letter from the Bulgarian worker
   <em>
    Lutibrodsky,
   </em>

    Sentenced to death by the dictatorship in 1934, to his father. This letter was broadcast to thousands of copies at the time as an example of the relentless struggle against the bourgeoisie and fascism.

    "My dear melinée, my little beloved orphan,
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   In a few hours, I will not be of this world. We are going to be shot this afternoon at 3 p.m. It happens to me as an accident in my life, I don't believe it but yet I know that I will never see you again. What can I write to you? Everything is confused in me and very clear at the same time.
  </p>
<p>
   I engaged in the army of the liberation as a volunteer soldier and I die on the verge of victory and the goal. Happiness to those who will survive us and taste the sweetness of the freedom and peace of tomorrow. I am sure that the French people and all the fighters of freedom will honor our memory with dignity. When I die, I proclaim that I have no hatred against the German people and against anyone, everyone will have what they deserve as punishment and a reward.
  </p>
<p>
   The German people and all other peoples will live in peace and fraternity after the war which will last longer. Happiness to all ... I have a deep regret not having made you happy, I would have liked to have a child of you, as you always wanted. So I beg you to marry you after the war, without fault, and to have a child for my happiness, and to fulfill my last will, combine with someone who can make you happy.
  </p>
<p>
   […]
  </p>
<p>
   With the help of friends who will honor me, you will publish my poems and my writings that are worth read. You will bring my memories if possible to my parents in Armenia. I will die with my 23 comrades earlier with the courage and serenity of a man who has a very quiet conscience, because personally, I did not hurt anyone and if I did it, I I did without hatred.
  </p>
<p>
   Today it's sunny. It is by looking at the sun and the beautiful nature that I loved so much that I would say goodbye to life and to all of you, my dear woman and my very dear friends. I forgive all those who hurt me or who wanted to hurt me except the one who betrayed us to buy his skin and those who sold us. I kiss you hard as well as your sister and all the friends who know me from afar or near, I tighten you all on my heart. Farewell. Your friend, your comrade, your husband.

<p>
   " "Dear father !
  </p>
<p>
   I received your letter a few days ago. You advise me to do everything to escape the gallows. And you write: "Do it today, because tomorrow it will be too late". Do you not understand that this proposal is not salvation but a certain death, even if I have life left? For you to understand this, it is necessary to examine the question in depth. Currently, the bourgeoisie has succeeded in bringing severe blows to the proletariat and its party. But does that mean that the domination of the bourgeoisie is stabilized and that the final victory does not belong to the proletariat? No ! If it is not today, at least tomorrow, the proletariat will defeat the Moribonde class and, thanks to its party, will advance the development of human society. We, son of this rising class and members of his conscious avant-garde, we must not fear for our life and sacrifice, for that, the prestige of the party.
  </p>
<p>
   What need do we have of our life, father, if it is up to us to remain living corpses with the help of which the reactionary class in decline will strive to have the ranks of the revolutionary proletariat and use me, which will have ceased to live, to prolong his own existence? No ! I prefer to die and stay alive in the heart of my class! Better to die than to be a living and stinking corpse!
  </p>
<p>
   Well, you will say to me, but think of Mara and Ilitch [1]. What will they do without you? ”. I think a lot about them, my father. Myself, I don't know how to express my love to them. When I think of them, a huge bitterness takes hold of me and I feel like lead in my chest. A suffering that forces me to squeeze my teeth so hard that they creak, and yet to promise me to resist, to keep my strengths and to continue to fight until the last moment, raised against the class which is responsible, not only Because my Ilitch did not see his father and that my partner remains without me, but also, because millions of other families must live in misery, deprivation and hunger.
  </p>
<p>
   Faced with the millions of unemployed, faced with the danger of a new war [note: refers to the imperialist world war], whose human brain cannot conceive of horror, before the millions of victims that it will massacre, not only among Soldiers, but still among women and children, because asphyxiating gases, bacilli of plague and cholera do not choose victims, before all these horrors, that capitalism brings us and will bring us again, what right would give -I to the enemy a weapon against all of us, whose blood he sucks? No ! I can not do it ! For this cursed state of capitalism, I see no other outcome than that indicated by my party and this outcome leads to the complete economic and political liberation of the proletariat and workers. My life was a struggle, a struggle to impose this solution. And if the Bulgarian bourgeoisie intends to condemn me to death, it means that I remained a faithful son of my class, a faithful son of my party. And that will be enough for you, in Ilitch and Mara. Yes, death; But Ilitch will know why his father fought and fell into this fight; He will know that he preferred to fall into the fight to cover himself with shame, to swarm to you, and to this son that I have never seen. It's true, it's hard to expect death at any time, to shudder at the slightest noise, to count their steps ... Here they are, they come to take you. Your heart is beating everything. But the steps go away and you fall on the bed, like a mature fruit falling from the tree. And the nerves do not support it ... and we call death, saving death. The agony is terrible, death is not!
  </p>
<p>
   And, precisely at that time, the enemy tries to make me reject my whole past activity. And you know, father, that he has already tried this temptation several times to be able to triumph then: "See! Another prodigal son who comes back to reason, who regrets what he did! ”. It is by such ignominies that the enemy wants to weaken faith in the party and prolong the existence of this class harmful to society. No, I will not participate in this despicable game!
  </p>
<p>
   This does not mean that I will let myself do without doing anything. Of course, everything must be done to save me. But be careful not to give the enemy arguments against the party. The best is to mobilize public opinion against my death sentence.
  </p>
<p>
   I will walk calmly and happily to the gallows with the awareness of having, in my short life devoted to the struggle for freedom, soiled neither the name of my party, nor your name.
  </p>
<p>
   And, with the rope around the neck, I shout you: head high, father, armed woman, my son that I have never seen! Comrades, forward! Although paid for harsh sacrifices, victory is for us! Whoever is ready for sacrifices will have the victory! Physically dead, the fighters will live in the conscience of the victorious proletariat. And their children will harvest the fruits of the struggle that their fathers have led. You too, my little Ilitch, that I cannot kiss either for the first or for the last time.

     The class struggle rages all over the world. Wherever we look, we look at the wars, the genocide, the blood baths and massacre, which the imperialism sparks in the desperate attempt to escape its upcoming downfall. Imperialism, which brings wealth and prosperity to exploiters, the exploited poverty and misery is in a deep crisis that is fueled by the ongoing struggle of the peoples of the world that fight courageously and stubbornly against the yoke of their oppression. The face of this dying beast is currently particularly ugly in Palestine, where Yankee imperialism with its Israeli slaughtering-also supported by German imperialism! - drives the hideous genocide of the people of Palestine, which holds up the flag of resistance and defends with its blood. Even if the enemy is armed to the teeth and equipped with the latest technology, the people of Palestine are struggling with all the means available and proves that victory is with you every day. The role that the women of the people play - also within the national resistance front of the Palestine people - is by no means passive or to pure "support work", on the contrary, the women in our class and the people are in the front row and fight! The participation of women in the decades of heroic struggle of the people of Palestine has existed as long as this struggle itself and the rest of the world also looks no different; The best examples of this are the People's Wars in Peru, India, Turkey and in the Philippines. Wherever there is a fight, the women also get up and show that half of the sky belongs and they will conquer it!
    </span>
</span>
</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; text-align: justify;">
<span>
<span>
     In this country, too, the women in our class are suppressed twice - through imperialism and patriarchy - and are therefore also struggling for double reason. Each of us can feel that every day. We are forced to let ourselves be exploited at work under often miserable circumstances and at the same time should take care of child rearing and the household, not to mention relatives in need of care. Our bosses get full of the pockets, and if we and our class brothers no longer bring you profit, let us fall into unemployment or short -time work overnight and rob us of the last wages.
    </span>

<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; text-align: justify;">

     The bourgeois state does everything to maintain this state, after all, its own existence depends on it. It is therefore not surprising that we are the first to be invested by austerity measures, while the great money is invested in arms deliveries and upgrading so that the German state can secure its imperialist interests in the world, be it in Ukraine or in so -called "Middle East". After the government with Olaf Scholz at the top recently unconstitutional in the interest of the bourgeoisie money in the usual gangster manner, the billions now missing should be brought back in by savings in the event of social spending. As always, the load is invited to the shoulders of the working class. The planned cuts, e.g. in the citizens' allowance, particularly affect us women, after all, we still earn almost 20% less in the FRG than men, while we are almost ten times more single parent and therefore often dependent on corresponding financial supports. We have also been waiting for the promised "basic childcare" for over a year, but more than every fifth child in the FRG is still alive in poverty and no improvement is far and wide. It does not look better for childcare: Although every child is entitled to a daycare center by law from the age of one year, almost 400,000 places are missing throughout the FRG, and of course in the workers' districts. The few daycare centers that exist, as well as schools, Horts and other care facilities, are systematically understaffed, are saved and have been left out: Another factor that forces us in unemployment! The rulers are also too happy to save on our health: the already miserable health care of the entire working class, for us women there is also the immense breakdown of delivery rooms and birth stations, a huge lack of gynecologists and clinics that carry out abortions. And if we get the effects of the patriarchy, for example, through domestic violence, in most cases the perpetrator is not prosecuted, but the woman is simply deported to a women's shelter. And even that only if you are lucky, because, contrary to the bourgeois law, women's shelters are absolutely in short supply.
    </span>
</span>
</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; text-align: justify;">
<span>
<span>
     Everything the state gives us is empty promises. Every apparent improvement is nothing but bread crumbs that we are thrown from time to time so that we can hold our mouths. Because for us there can be no improvement within this rotted society. As long as imperialism exists, our exploitation and oppression by the patriarchy will also exist. One cannot be smashed without the other, because the basis of both is the same: private property. Only the combined struggle with our class brothers for a classless society can create the basis for our emancipation. To serve this goal, we need a class -conscious women's movement that is fighting for the reconstitution of the Communist Party of Germany and our actual emancipation!

<p>
  Military police murdered 7 people, invaded houses, prohibited the circulation of residents and caused the closure of schools and health clinics during a megaoperation that reached all the slums of the German and Penha complexes in the north of Rio de Janeiro. Adjacent communities such as Flexal, Train, Queen Engenho, Small, Squeeze, Ipase, Guaporé and Quitungo were also targeted. In the South Zone and West Zone, the Cidade de Deus and Rocinha slums were surrounded by police. Another megaoperation also took the Maré Complex, executed by Civil Police police. The action counts as another slaughter mega operation by Governor Claudio Castro during his term of office in Rio de Janeiro, with logistical, financial and political support from the federal government.
 </p>
<p>
  Four of the dead were murdered by teams of the 21st Military Police Battalion in the Penha Complex. The Battalion is led by Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Pereira Cardozo. Four other people were injured in Flexal and another was shot in Nova Brasilia.
 </p>
<p>

  <strong>
   UPDATE 27/02, 18h07: Megaoperations also have the contingent of the Special Operations Battalion (BOPE) and the Battalion of Dog Action (BAC). Both police forces fulfill central role in genocidal operations promoted by the RJ government in favelas
  </strong>
  ]
 </p>
<p>
  The dead were, on many occasions, left dropped by the PMs. Residents had to collect the corpses and carry them to appropriate places, sometimes under threats and sights of the military. Videos on social networks show residents carrying bloody bodies in different parts of the German complex.

  Closed schools and clinics
 </h4>
<p>
  As a result of the invasion, 20.5 thousand students from municipal schools were left without class. In the Penha Complex, there were 16 municipal schools that suspended classes. They serve 4,800 students. In German, 20 municipal units ceased to work due to megaoperation, violating the right to learn 7.1 thousand students. At Maré, where the Civil Police Special Resources Coordination (Core) undertakes the megaoperation, 24 schools that serve 8.1 thousand students closed. Finally, at Morro do Trem, 342 students from 2 schools could not study.
 </p>
<p>
  The right to work was also violated, as small slum merchants were prevented from opening their establishments. On Itararé Avenue, the main road in front of Complexo do Alemão, all trades closed.
 </p>
<p>
  Health units also had to stop attending patients today. In German, the Family Clinic (CF) Zilda Arns interrupted the operation, while in Penha the Aloysio Augusto Family Clinic suspended home visits. Already at Maré, CF Jeremias Moraes da Silva also interrupted the operation in the morning, and CF Diniz Batista dos Santos interrupted visits to the houses of residents.
 </p>
<p>
  In addition, at least 15 municipal bus lines stopped circulating in the morning. This was because the shots fired during the police mega operation crossed the Garage of the Nossa Senhora de Lourdes Viação in Penha. Buses serve at least 130,000 people.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   [Update, 27/02, 6:10 pm: According to the and the local correspondent, the region was still without light due to damage caused to the energy transformer. A resident reported that Light, a large company responsible for the city's power supply notified that it would only climb in the region when the situation “was under control”, leaving residents in the climate of uncertainty about when they will have the basic right to access energy. back]

<strong>
   Climate of revolt
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  According to netizens, motorcycle taxis of the German complex plan a protest against the police slaughter. It is possible that in other slums the rebellion climate will be repeated. This year alone, residents held protests in Maré, against an operation on February 8, and in
  <a href="https://anovademocracia.com.br/rj-operacao-policial-provoca-revolta-e-manifestacoes-em-manguinhos/">
   Manguinhos, on January 18
  </a>
  . In the tide,
  <a href="https://anovademocracia.com.br/rj-policia-militar-do-governador-genocida-claudio-castro-mata-jovem-no-complexo-da-mare/">
   A young man was executed at close range by PMs during the protest
  </a>
  . The cowardly murder further increased the residents' revolt against police violence.
 </p>
<p>
  Today's operations add to the extensive operations list promoted by Governor Claudio Castro against Rio de Janeiro's favelas. So far, Castro is already responsible for 3 of the 5 largest slaughter in the history of RJ. Last year, Governor Genocida received investments from hundreds of millions of reais from the federal government to buy new equipment for the police. Castro was also praised by Lula in rallies organized in Rio de Janeiro last year.

 The people and youth of the country are in turmoil! Across 
 Subsequent attack promoted by the government and overall the system, 
 Significant resistances are born. Youth is a cauldron that 
 boils and gives a big battle against the private bill on private 
 Universities, with mass assemblies, occupations and demonstrations. The 
 farmers have been massively out of the blocks, against anti -groomed policy 
  Government-EU that has ruined their lives.
 <b>
  Workers we have 
 need to unite our own voice with the rest of the struggling pieces 
 of the people and to organize our struggle for work and life with 
 Rights!

 THE 
  working class and employees in private and public sectors 
 suffocate under the weight of everyday life. Precision has 
 crush the popular households. Real wages have fallen 
 vertically and the month does not come out, at the same time that capital 
 Treasures at our expense. The government invites us to get used to the 
 poverty and poverty, supposedly because this is what the strengths require 
 economy, while giving tens of billions to buy and 
 F-35 equipment.

 The 
 supposed measures to deal with accuracy announced the 
  Government staff is a raw mockery! The increase in the bottom 
 salary promised by Mitsotakis, but also the false-fracture of the 
 three years, they will not give any breath to workers who 
 they are narrowing. Are communicative tricks that the government tries to 
  entertain their anger. Up to the crumbs of the various 
 Benefits/Pass cut and what is left is the battle for the 
 survival.
 <br/>
<br/>
<b>
  The Middle Ages is what envisions the capital for the world of work.
 </b>
 Work all day long and up to old age as cynically describes 
 recent anti -labor law Georgiadis. Labor -in -law, in which the 
 workers will work until extermination, for a piece of bread. 
 Intensification and inhumane working conditions, with consumables 
 workers, where they will be killed or crumbled daily to 
 Employment is profitable. The search for cheap labor hands in 
 immigrant workers who are intended to work in terms 
 slave, shows the work landscape they want to shape for the 
 all the employees of the country. And at the same time criminalized the 
 trade unionism, unionists are being fired and prosecuted as provided by 
 Hatzidakis' law-to-be 
 He was trying to convince us PAME).
 <br/>
<br/>
 And yet while workers face a nightmare and an even worse future,
 <b>
  trade union leadership take care to keep workers on the sidelines
 </b>
 . 
  And even at the time of the racing in progress 
 mobilizations of students and farmers, and requires maximum racing 
  Coalition! The inexplicable (and more employer than ever) leadership of GSEE 
  announces a strike in the ... distant future, April 17, giving 
 time to government to unfold the anti-labor-anti-Antilated policy 
 her. But PAME also did what they could to not meet 
 Workers-Agre-Neoa on a common front. So he announced a strike 
 So far away, for the end of February. And of course neither is it noticing to 
 Modify, to proclaim it now that "the cauldron is boiling". This 
 Attitude of trade union leadership is leading the labor movement 
 from defeat to defeat and cultivates frustration and defeat in the 
  employees.
 <br/>
<br/>
<b>
  We will not stay on the sidelines! Will not 
 We accept yet another strike-in-two rifle. We give it from now on 
 Battle, on the side of the competitors-student-agrarian students!
 </b>
<br/>
<br/>
 To 
  We spoil their plans! We have to do what is going through today 
  our hand to unite our voice with the students and their 
 farmers. Their struggles are also our own struggles and have to 
 We support. And that is the best way to work for the 
 Success of the strike on February 28th.
 <b>
  There is no waiting attitude.

 Employees need to take the case of the race in our own hands!

  A 29 -track musical album to tell the Saga of the Castaway Aleixo Garcia, who traveled to the Andes for indigenous people from Santa Catarina and Mato Grosso do Sul, using the Peabiru path and discovering the Inca Empire before the Spaniards, is The dream that the Pantanal artist Moacir Lacerda is performing this 2024 in his state, with the release of
  <em>
   "Aleixo Garcia - A Épica day".
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  Although he is still looking for new partnerships, the recordings are in full swing, in the studio of musician Gilson Espíndola in the capital Campo Grande.
 </p>
<p>
  The tracks are almost finalized and the release of the CD is scheduled for the end of March.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Pro-Indigenous Children's Book
 </h4>
<p>
  The musician Moacir, (whose affectionate nickname is “Alma Pantaneira”), has a vast list of artistic works and is one of the founders of the Famous Eyes (Association of autonomous composers of the Amambaí neighborhood), research and encouragement to folklore.
 </p>
<p>
  “(Aleixo Garcia's 500 -year celebration) is not just the issue of music,” says Moacir. “It has a cycle of lectures to discuss the theme with society, with names such as Professor Gilson Martins (former president of the Brazilian Archeology Society, former director of the Federal Univ. Historical and geographical MS). Names also like Rodrigo Teixeira, writer; Carlos Vera, Gilson Espíndola and journalist Rosana Bond from Florianópolis ”.
 </p>
<p>
  And he goes on: “There is also (the proposal to publish) an illustrated children's book to tell this story to generations that need to change the mindset (colonialist and white, contrary to the Indians).”
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  The first European
 </h4>
<p>
  “One thing that, unfortunately, I will also have to sing is the decimation of the original peoples, who started from these entrances (from the first white foreigners),” laments Moacir.
 </p>
<p>
  “The repertoire has historical, social, etymological questions, indigenous ethnicities and their extermination and suffering, (…) not only in South America, but also in A.Central and A.do Norte. This album sings this spoliation, this decimation. Therefore, on the cover, will be Aleixo Garcia and the figure of an Inca and (other) indigenous figures there. He is not the discoverer. He was the first European who arrived in these lands. Here they already inhabited indigenous nations for over 10,000 years, according to archaeological studies. ”
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  MS as a cradle of America
 </h4>
<p>
  “From this A. Garcia walk, virtually all foundation expeditions of most South American countries pass through M. Grosso do Sul, in the Albuquerque region. From this, here is the cradle of Latin America ”, reinforces Moacir.
 </p>
<p>
  “Because from this region, you could go north, Amazon. I could go south, Paraguay, Argentina, Uruguay, Chile. To the Atlantic and the Pacific. I could go to Bolivia and (still east) would find M.Gerais, S.Paulo, R. de Janeiro, ”he maps.
 </p>
<p>
  “This region is a central point (called by the Spanish 1500) by Laguna de Los Xarayes, where several indigenous nations lived. The Paiaguás, the Guaicurus, Guatós, Porrudos and Xarayes. It had plenty of fish and hunting. There lived the nations (from the downs) and also the Inca nations (of the altitudes), ”says the musician.“ They had contact (with each other), and that was the cradle of Latin America. ”
 </p>
<p>
  The songs reflect all this variety, he informs. “They have Spanish influences, indigenous sounds, there are laments, requiens, called, raised. You take the musical culture coming out of 1500 and bring it here, to our day. ”
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Fear and negationism
 </h4>
<p>
  Even after 5 centuries, the made of Aleixo Garcia and his indigenous friends bother the ruling classes of Brazil and South America. “This is because the symbolism of Guarani force (notably warrior) and the great power of its culture invigorated in today's dissemination do With the capitalists feel fear, ”says Rosana Bond, author of the pioneer and already classic book
  <strong>
<em>
    Aleixo Garcia's saga: the discoverer of the Inca Empire
   </em>
</strong>
  (Digital Version Editora Aimberê/and and, 2022).
 </p>
<p>
  “It is an uncontrolled fear of the exploited class, of which the original nations are part. Entire peoples that capital tries to extinguish or suffocate to seize its natural/material resources, receiving in return a haughtiness and resistant courage that seems eternal, ”says Rosana.
 </p>
<p>
  “The reaction of the fearful, so it has been that typical of cowardice: denying or running away. For they now have decided to say that Aleixo never existed. And that also existed his trip (departure from SC) of discovery of the Empire of Incas, along with the brave Guaranis. ”
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Psychological disease?
 </h4>
<p>
  Days ago that's what happened in Paraguay and Mato Grosso do Sul.
 </p>
<p>
  Almost at the same time, as if it were something combined, 2 historians, one in Asunción and one in C.Lar, they began to deny the existence of Aleixo.
 </p>
<p>
  And both, equally, came to demand from pro-festivities of the 500-year-olds and the Peabiru Way the presentation of evidence about Garcia.
 </p>
<p>
  In the case of MS, a member of the ruling classes, M. Lorenzetto, said in the
  <em>
   Campo Grande News
  </em>
  , on February 17: “I challenge any historian to show a document from Aleixo Garcia out of the Spanish or Portuguese archives. I can challenge that I have done this exhaustive research. ”
 </p>
<p>
  It is an unleashed lie, they say MS residents. It is possible that this person has a serious psychological disease, suppose and regrets old colleagues of the challenger.
 </p>
<p>
  This is because the media recorded the presence of M.In May 26, 2009 at an event of the state government, which launched books "that rescue the historical origins of the MS".
 </p>
<p>
  One of these books, praised by M. himself to the press on the day of the event, was by the 16th century author Ruy Díaz de Guzmán (1559-1629), one of the most notable documents of the South American achievement.
 </p>
<p>
  In the work, called
  <strong>
<em>
    History of the discovery, population and conquest of the orders of the Rio de la Plata
   </em>
</strong>
  ,
  <strong>
<em>
</em>
</strong>
  Guzmán informed Aleixo's trip to the Incas, even giving him the point (between the future villages of Mizque and Tomin).
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  The “danger of the huge force Guarani”
 </h4>
<p>
  Latifundal ally, M. wrote that “an old legend is the Guarani Indians: they would be unbeatable. It is the so -called 'Guarani ethos', characteristic traits that would differentiate it from other indigenous groups. There would be an huge force of these people when in combat. Contrary to popular belief, this dangerous idea is not born in the Paraguayan War. Comes with the legendary figure of Aleixo Garcia. ”
 </p>
<p>
  M. made clear the lack of variety of landowners in the face of this: “The legend of A.Gracia has been used to demonstrate that Guarani Indians can go to the fight, can take farms from Brazilians on our border. After all, wouldn't they be unbeatable? ” M.'s words show the impact caused by Aleixo and his Guarani friends, present in hatred devoted to them by rural capitalist criminals, 5 centuries after the splendid saga.

  On February 26, workers from the Municipal Transport Company Viação Hamburguesa and Intermunicipal Highways went on strike to require a salary increase and the payment of other basic rights such as food stamps and additional double-function. The strike spread throughout the city of Esteio, which is in the metropolitan zone of Porto Alegre, and caused the fury of companies' mogles, who released false accusations about the strike as a way to foster police repression against the strikers.
 </p>
<p>
  Drivers also report that the food allowance decreased during the Covid-19 pandemic period and never returned to the previous value. Companies try to deceive the road with lame excuses for the lack of rights, but are unable to contain the class struggle. In the last period, the tycoons used the “competition” with the other companies to justify the low remuneration. A blatant lie, both for the monopolistic character of large companies and by the millionaire incentives received by the state. Companies received at least $ 10 million in incentives recently.
 </p>
<p>
  Demonstrating his hatred for popular movement and commitment to the great bourgeois, the mayor of Esteio has announced that all strikers will have a suspended employment contract while the strike lasts.
 </p>
<p>
  The two companies also released data and slander accusations against the strikers, stating that they would not have respected the law that at least 35% of the bus fleet should continue to operate. Laws like these are, in fact, serious violations of the right to workers' strike. In explosive struggles, it is common for workers to completely stop service in rejecting rights like this. In the Strike of Esteio, the lines that the workers use most to work in the city of Esteio were kept in operation in the mobilization, while lines that go to Porto Alegre and Novo Hamburgo, also very busy, were paralyzed.

  The US Consulate in Recife was hit with red paint bombs during a demonstration on February 26, where hundreds of people expressed their solidarity to the heroic Palestinian resistance in the center of the Pernambuco capital. In the same action, Yanques and Zionist flags were also set on fire by the present, who shouted
  <strong>
   Death! Death! To imperialism!
  </strong>
  e
  <strong>
   Ianques! Go Home!
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  The demonstration began at Derby Square around 4 pm, and the way began to the consulate Yankee an hour later. The protest had several democratic popular forces, including the Red Mangrove collective and the wind movement.

  On the way to the consulate, a red mangrove activist pointed out in a speech in the sound car the need to defend the Palestinian National Resistance and greeted the numerous actions in solidarity with her in the world, who pressured express “enemies of the people”, as the agent Brazilian Luiz Inácio, criticizing Israel's crimes. On the way to the consulate Yankee, protesters shouted slogans such as:
  <strong>
   Out of Gaza, Israel Fascist! Outside Ianques, from Latin America
  </strong>
  ,
  <strong>
   Palestinian fight, no step back! Live the resistance, all support to Hamas!
  </strong>
  ,
  <strong>
   Youth of Yemen and Palestine, his fight continues in Latin America
  </strong>
  e
  <strong>
   No more slaughter, PM in the favela and Israel in Palestine
  </strong>

  At the end of the demonstration, the activists performed the act of profound anti-imperialist content in front of the US Consulate building. During the action, the protesters noted that the glass of the yankery building was already broken by previous episodes. The demonstration dispersed around 19h.

Images: (Correspondence from the quarter) Vienna/Floridsdorf: On New Year's Eve 2022, the workers' settlement Mitterhofgasse (Dr.-Franz-Koch-Hof) already came to the media due to a massively excessive police operation and disproportionate police force.

    Now this settlement made headlines again when the video shooting of some young people and children was interrupted by a massive police operation. It was a group of around 40 people, mainly young people, but also adults and children were there. They posed with various flags and fake weapons for the shooting of a music video. According to their own information, they wanted to set a sign of peace and cohesion with the video. However, it turned out differently than expected. After a short time, the Wega civil servant was surrounded.

    The Dr.-Franz-Koch-Hof is certainly not free from problems, as is rarely the case in such systems. However, an example is to be stated here. An example of repression and intimidation in the workers' districts. This corresponds to the trend to dissolve communities, to deepen problems of the neighborhood and migration, not to differentiate and to drive a wedge into the population. In the past few weeks, the 90th anniversary of the fights of Feber 12th in 1934 was commemorated. In contrast, they were a great example of the resistance of the workers and the population, which was particularly expressed in the workers' settlements. The policy of the rulers places it to prevent "ghettoization", problems of migration, as well as repression, a situation as in Feber 1934. "Never again," does not mean "never fascism" in the mouth of the rulers, much more: We never want to face a strong working class again.

     Correspondence are contributions from different parts of the population, so to speak a direct mouthpiece from the people. Their commonality is that the respective correspondents report directly from their everyday life: from the company, the quarter, family, school, etc. ... as a press from the people, not only presses the revolutionary and democratic press the interests of the majority of the population Out, but also actively integrates their representatives, gives them a voice, presents the various opinions and ideas from the masses to be able to compare them and to have them into discussion. That is why the workers find the workers in the red flag, voices of the youth and women's movement, the students, the union forces, migrants as well as the small self-employed and traders, voices from the city and country, a platform and an organ. The correspondents are not editorial members, which is why they are not tied to the leaf line in the narrower sense, but rather express “their voice”.

    Continue to the pretext of the "fight against Hamas", the Israeli government is expanding its offensive and is now planning to start the attacks on Rafah. Rafah is located in the southern part of the Gaza Strip. More than half of the residents of the Gaza Strip have fled to Rafah to look for protection against war. With this planned attack, the prevailing Israel again show that it is about a war against the Palestinian people and their resistance movement.

    The fact that the war is very well led against the Palestinian people can also be seen from the fact that the auxiliary deliveries are currently impossible. According to the UN, aid deliveries have almost come to a standstill in the past two weeks. The northern part of Gazas can currently no longer be reached by land. Aid goods from Great Britain had to be thrown out of the air for the first time. The World Food Program (WPF) was only able to record deliveries last Sunday (!) For the first time in three weeks (!). The extent of the humanitarian disaster is enormous. Diseases, water shortages and famine are the result of Israeli warfare and occupation policy.

    In order to further secure control over the Gaza Strip, Israel is now expanding a “West-East corridor”. This wants to maintain the "security control" in Gaza. This "security control" means further oppression for the Palestinian people, another attack on the Palestinians' right to self -determination!

<p>
  On July 6, 2005, the United Nations Mission for Haiti Stabilization (MINUSTAH), led by the Brazilian Army and, specifically, by Augusto Heleno, undertook an operation called “Iron Fist”. From dawn to dusk for seven hours, the operation mobilized 440 soldiers, with a support of 41 armored and a helicopter; Community exits were blocked by soldiers. The injured were not taken to the hospital, but before, they were abandoned by the bloodthirsty troop. It is estimated that seven people were killed. Operation terrified Haiti and the world, and became known as Cité Soleil's massacre.
 </p>
<p>
  Who followed the news of the operation of the Military Police (PM) in Rio de Janeiro, in the complexes of Maré, German and Penha, today, will have a feeling of
  <em>
   storyline vu
  </em>
  . What's more, those who live in a favela in any metropolis in Brazil will not be close to such brutality that had shocked the world, as it was unfortunately a scene very close to the daily life of the popular masses of large urban centers.
 </p>
<p>
  The resemblance is no coincidence. Police forces are operationally responding to state governments, but as auxiliary and reserve forces of the reactionary army, are centralized by the high command of this genocidal institution. The Military Police General, the Army High Command organ, exercises the PMs doctrinal command, selects courses promotion tables, defines the warned war material and forms of organization.
 </p>
<p>
  PMs perform, in the slums, the doctrine of
  <em>
   conflict
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   low -intensity war
  </em>
  . They establish a war conflict, with unconventional shapes, without mass and permanent mobilization of troops, but with more or less bulky operations in a restricted and calculated area symmetrically so as not to generate political commotion or resistance to the ongoing war. It is a form of
  <em>
   war
  </em>
  against the people, intending not to arouse resistance.
 </p>
<p>
  This is what the Generals learned in Haiti. This is what they are practicing now in slums across the country, especially cariocas, through their auxiliary forces. The army does this without consideration for the verbiage of this or that shift government. This does not change, although there is always alternation of the party in the federal government. Large centers workers, slum residents, continue to die, while successive federal governments push responsibility to the state, because no one faces the secret government that works within the Armed Forces. As we see, in this republic, weapons send in politics.

<p>
  A measure that will widen the tax exemption of churches advance at a stride. Today, PEC 5/23, which deals with “tax immunity”, was unanimously approved in a commission of the Chamber of Deputies. His rapporteur, Fernando Máximo (União Brasil, Goiás) argued that unions and political parties should be excluded from the exemption, expanding it only to religious entities and temples. The measure is supported by the Government base, formed by the PT and other acronyms of the false left and the "centrão".
 </p>
<p>
  With the new measure, any organization linked to the churches will have tax exemption, in a condition of “tax immunity”, which is how PEC is known in Congress. The rapporteur of the project is Marcelo Crivella, former mayor of Rio de Janeiro who is now deputy for Republicans. Crivella had already stated that "surely every evangelical bench would mobilize against the Lula administration, who will not want to buy a fight of this size."
 </p>
<p>
  With the support of the measure, which should be sent for voting in the plenary soon, Luiz Inácio will hardly be able to achieve his goal of reducing his rejection among evangelicals. To achieve this, it is no use giving tax exemption to the churches, as it will be considered vulgar by the evangelical mass that rejects it, while it will not alter the far-right ideological basis of most Pentecostal leaders. On the other hand, it will certainly strengthen people like Silas Malafaia, a bow figure in the far-right agitation of the last 25th.
 </p>
<p>
  There are no few tax exemptions, religious entities and temples. During the pandemic, Congress passed a law that dismissed the churches from paying taxes that accounted for $ 1.2 billion. Of a total of 9,230 existing evangelical groups in the country, only 5 of the churches concentrated 70% of this debt. Among them is RR Soares, whose son, Deputy David Soares, was the one who suggested the amendment at the time.
 </p>
<p>
  Data found at the National Treasury Attorney General indicate that 16 religious groups concentrate a huge debt of non -tax payment: R $ 1.6 billion. The first place, which goes ahead owing more than half a billion, is a facade church controlled by the Golden Cross private health group. Next is the company registered in the name of a deceased, which owes R $ 388 million. The third, debtor of R $ 153.6 million, is from Pastor Valdomiro, who invited Bolsonaro in his church on the eve of the first round of the 2022 elections. Hence one can see who are the main interested in “tax immunity”: groups Millionaires linked to the private monopoly of health services, façade companies for money laundering and exploiters of the faith of others. Is it to these people that the federal government wants to ally in order to reduce its rejection before the evangelical sectors?
 </p>
<p>
  The “evangelical bench” is made up of more than 200 deputies. Reinforced by the “conservative bench”, it reaches 380. Among them is the cream of the far-right coup organized in the most different partisan political acronyms of the country. For example, the notorious pocketist Magno Malta, who climbed the electric trio during the last demonstration convened by Jair Bolsonaro on February 25. Malta criticized Luiz Inacio last month, when the IRS suspended a measure edited still in the Bolsonaro government that expanded tax exemption to evangelical pastors. The reaction of the evangelical bench was almost immediate. And Lula retreated, giving his support to PEC, which today was approved in the House Commission.
 </p>
<p>
  Luiz Inácio (and the PT) will probably maintain the argument that “it is necessary to dialogue with evangelicals”, throwing sand in the eyes only, while money laundering is legalized to a specific sector of the country. It is noted that,, The more money it accumulates, the more powerful these false religious, extremist leaders become; and therefore more political and ideological influence on society. The departure adopted by Luiz Inacio is, therefore, here too, the vile conciliation, which will give the worsening of his delicate situation.

   In Brazil, a paramilitary organization has formed and on behalf of right to fascist large landowners, the goal of which is to continue against the country invasions of poor farmers.
  </a>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  In this way, the contradiction finds mass-half-feudalism that is now concretized in the argument between the poor and the landless farmers and the large landowners. Brazilian military police reach back but have formed their own armed combat association. The goal of the large landowner association, which has given itself the right name "zero invasions", is against the agricultural revolution in Brazil and especially the country invasions of the poor farmers. Founder of the organization is the former arch -reactionary President of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The democratic and revolutionary newspaper "A Nova Democracia" describes in an article that this organization is by no means a completely new thing, but has been acting since March last year and has set itself the goal of Brazil against poor farmers, indigenous peoples and To become active, which is equivalent to a declaration of war according to the newspaper. A qualitative leap is said to have been completed in the organization's actions. Since its foundation, the actions of the "Null Invasion" have been limited to attempts at intimidation and siege from fighting farmers and their country invasions.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  However, on January 21 of this year, 200 large landowners and their mercenaries organized a military operation against the indigenous area of Caramuru-Catarina in which they entered the area in joint action and protection with the Brazilian military police to drive the indigenous population from their country. In this armed attack, the indigenous activist and farmer Nega Pataxó was shot by the son of a large landowner. The day before, the military police prepared this military operation by entering the area of the indigenous people, beating indigenous people and their cell phones could not take any shots of the following raid.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The article continues to report the "zero invasion" already very closely worked together with armed forces of the old Brazilian state in other states. Finally, the newspaper summarizes that the poor farmers, indigenous and quilombolas in the fight for their right to land do not remain many options than what the league of the poor farmers propagated last year: armed self -defense against the war of large landowners.

<br>
   The newspaper "A Nova Democracia" informs in another article that will take place on March 9th and 10th in the state of Maranhão.
  </br></a>
  This folk tribunal will be composed of human rights defenders, activists and researchers and has set itself the goal of examining and condemning the crimes of the large landowners and the old Brazilian state of more than 10 farmers' communities in the Gurupi region on the border between the states of Para and Maranhão. For this purpose, the affected farmers should report their reports on the numerous crimes against them directly in front of the folk tribunal. In addition, a group of lawyers should submit their report on the crimes committed against the farmers in the communities. Thereupon an inspection of the crime scenes should also be carried out.
 </br></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  On March 10th, each member of the assessment commission should then be seen, seen and heard and submitted his personal assessment from which a uniform report is then created with necessary recommendations. The folk tribunal will be organized in partnership with the committee of solidarity with the struggle for the country and the Union of the communities in combat.

<br/>
   In the state of Amazon, the federal court "Trf-1" responsible for the region has given the company "Potássio do Brasil" (in German: "" Potassium chloride from Brazil "), contrary to the decision of the Amazon Regional Court, the license to reduce potassium.
  </a>
  Previously, due to struggles of indigenous and poor farmers, there had been a victory over the company when the state court of the state ordered a ban on the mining of potassium in the region. The company "Potássio do Brasil" is - unlike in the name suggested - not a Brazilian degradation company, but a sham company of its shares in 70 percent Canadian and British corporations and banks such as "Forbes &amp; amp; Manhattan", "CD Capital" and belongs to "The Senter Group".
 </br></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  But the mining area on the banks of Madeirinha River inside the state of Amazon that is so interesting for imperialist investors has been populated by the indigenous people of the Mura for centuries, which has been fighting for the recognition of their country as an indigenous area for over 20 years demands the displacement and imperialist predatory construction in your home country.

 On Friday and Saturday there have been two important days.
 <p>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Who does 12 o'clock 
 Counter -information rossusaia is first of all a proletarian 
 avant -garde, a communist militant, an activist of 
 trade union organizations, women's organizations, is a companion engaged in the fight against repression, war and, in 
 particular in all these last months, in solidarity to the people 
 Palestinian and therefore it is clear that his main commitment was this.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The instrument 
 Counter -information rossusaia is partly our voice but also 
 the tool to push avant -garde workers, workers, young people, 
 women to organize themselves with us, to participate in the events 
 important that take place in this country against imperialism, the 
 war in solidarity with Palestine, equally important of the 
 workers, struggles against exploitation in factories, the 
 cut of work, salary in factories, equally 
 important such as the fight against deaths at work.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  It is evident that 
 These two days deserved the total, national and local commitment, 
 With everything he entails: travel, leaflets, preparation of the 
 material that these 2 important days deserved. Two days 
 who saw 100,000 - and mostly workers - go down to 
 square in all forms: Friday strike was important for 
 example in the logistics sector, but also in some realities of 
 factories from Piaggio to other minors, who have seen 
 events and on some of which we will return separately.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Two days that 
 they saw principals under the prefectures, which saw various forms 
 with which first of all the workers took the field, they took 
 position and it is important that basic and class unionism, 
 In all its different acronyms, he collected the appeal of young people 
 Palestinians who, in tune with when it happens in the strip of 
 Gaza and in West, they had called a strike and a 
 events.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  It's important 
 that at national level there was a choice to make a 
 national event in Milan on the 24th, in the city that had been 
 theater for weeks and weeks, with tenacity and self -denial, of 
 events every Saturday. The "Palestinian Saturday", the 
 Saturday of "We are all Palestinians", the Saturday of “Milan is 
 A Palestinian city ". Of course, in many other cities and many 
 Other realities have been manifestations in recent months, but 
 Certainly in Milan the extra step was taken, that of making 
 the solidarity battle with Palestine as the main one 
 political-social battle in this country against imperialism, 
 Against our government complicit in genocide and imperialism.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  100,000 how not 
 They had been seen for years. Most of them participated in the 
 Milan event with a long procession, a river, a tide, 
 As women who struggle in these say in general 
 last years and they did it in a great way on November 25th 
 last year.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This time it was 
 The tide of left -wing militants and activists, yes, extreme 
 left, because the extreme left, the revolutionary left, 
 antagonist, of social opposition, is the main material force 
 in the internationalist solidarity struggle with Palestine, but also the 
 reserve that can change things within this country, in the 
 political struggle, in the real social opposition to governments and the 
 State of capital and in particular to this government that concentrates in 
 he all the reasons for this opposition.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  A long procession, 
 unitary, united. The thousand voices, the thousand slogans all went to one 
 same direction, with a truly contingent in the lead 
 impressive of Palestinians who led to this event 
 the "living meat" of what is happening in the strip of 
 Gaza, in Palestine, a radical opposition to the genocide, a 
 General reversal of the Canea of Infamy and lies that vomits 
 the press, television enslaved to the government, imperialism, 
 even enslaved to the Nazi of Israel Nazi Zionist.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This 
 event is a point of arrival - it is useless to deny it - of this 
 tenacious battle to overthrow the toxic narrative on Palestine 
 and to show that even in the heart of the imperialist countries 
 Internationalism means being united with oppressed peoples that yes 
 rebel, which rebel against weapons, which internationalism is support 
 unconditional, moral, social, political to resistance 
 Palestinian.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Enough with 
 genocide, support for Palestinian resistance. These two issues 
 They were at the center of this great event. In it all 
 they made their contribution, they brought their specificity: 
 First of all, the workers of class unionism of class, with the 
 contingent, large, impressive, of logistics workers, 
 A sector in permanent struggle in this country, organized 
 Essentially from Si Cobas but not only, and students, social centers and 
 Many small, medium and large communist political organizations 
 revolutionary.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  A procession that does not 
 Of course he looked to the past, but who began to think about the new 
 future fueled by Palestine, as, to give an example, it happened 
 In the 1970s with the importance of the battle on Vietnam, the 
 support for the liberation struggle of Vietnam, led by the party 
 Communist of
  <span style="text-decoration: none;">
   Ho Chi Minh
  </span>
  , 
 supported by China of Mao and all the anti -imperialist forces 
 social and political in the world that also constituted a wind - the wind 
 Eastern - which gradually fired the prairie or a part of 
 it within imperialist countries.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  In this 
 all manifestation and we also pose the problem of 
 How to continue. There have been proposals of continuity that come 
 from all sides and primarily by the Palestinians of our country.

<br>
  We too from 
 trucks that guided the manifestation of the Palestinians we said the 
 ours, as well as having done it with two banners they collected 
 The main word "against the genocide of the people 
 Palestinian by the Nazi Israel Nazi Zionist State/A 
 support of the Palestinian resistance ". But we also placed the 
 problem of opposition to war, because this was also 
 The great merit of the national event of Milan and the two 
 days that united solidarity with the Palestinian people and the 
 support for his resistance with the fight against war 
 imperialist, the wars of capital, understood as a way of production, 
 system of states and governments that produce the march towards the war 
 which, as always, are profits for the war industry, for the 
 capital system that tries to come out with the war from the crisis in 
 to which it is and in which the world drags, which at the same time seeks 
 transform it into a gigantic new phase of oppression of peoples 
 of which Palestine looks like the symbol.
 </br></p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  War 
 imperialist can only be stopped if the popular war advances ", 
 that is, the proletarian war, the war of the exploited, the war 
 of the oppressed, from Palestine to Latin America, from India 
 to Africa, North Africa and the importance of fighting 
 against the imperialist beast inside, in the belly of the beast e 
 of our country's beast, given that we are in Italy, which is the government 
 fascist, imperialist, racist, militarist, interventionist, a 
 side of Israel, but also against the military contingent who goes to 
 Red Sea and also in Ukraine, with which it establishes a “corridor 
 black ”of military support, political coverage, etc. etc.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  From that stage 
 We said we must give maximum continuity to this 
 manifestation, but, of course, a movement of this kind that 
 faces an objectively prolonged struggle - because it is a war 
 prolonged that which is consumed in the Gaza strip and in the others 
 fire -in fire in the world - that a solidarity is needed 
 prolonged, an organized solidarity. In this sense we have 
 said by the stage: "We form the Palestine committees everywhere", as it was 
 in the 70s season, and the function of the Vietnam Committee that 
 there were really many and the material strength that in large and in the 
 small towns joined the long -lasting people's war of the 
 Vietnamese people.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  In the same 
 time the acting internationalism becomes a force of this 
 Battle of the Palestinians alongside the Palestinians in extensive form: 
 from the Court of Justice of the Aja to the same occupied territories. 
 From the stage we said we are for an international delegation 
 who participates in all this, we are for a contingent 
 internationalist who goes to Rafah and in the territories busy to offer 
 solidarity, support, to create a further problem 
 to the Nazi -type Zionist aggression, the logic of the genocide, 
 to the logic of the deportation of an entire people. We are for one 
 international delegation formed by all those who 
 manifest and represent all and naturally guided and melted with 
 The solidarity of the Palestinians from Gaza to our cities. A 
 internationalist contingent.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  In the final intervention 
 We said: let's fight against our government, ours 
 Imperialism, it is our task. Solidarity is not enough with whom 
 struggle in the territories invaded by war and aggression e 
 From oppression, we must overturn our imperialism. AND 
 This requires that we concentrate the struggle to hunt the government 
 Melons who, like other governments, is more or less in the same 
 sphere of what is called "Atlanticism", imperialism, governments alongside Ukraine in the war as part of that 
 deployment that wants to make war on Russia, respond to 
 Russia who invades with the war and drag us into the gigantic outbreak 
 of world war, with the great contrast between the power inside 
 main imperialist, the United States, and the antagonist of these 
 last years represented by China.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  To overturn the 
 Government it is necessary that the contents and the unit built in the 
 event of Milan leads to the factories, in the places of 
 work, on the territory, lean on the streets and squares for 
 overturn our government.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  And finally another 
 What we said - and here we could do it because whoever spoke 
 For us he came from Taranto, from Puglia - the companion who has us 
 represented has appealed to make the G7 in Puglia is one 
 new great opportunity because the entire movement of solidarity with 
 Palestine unites all the reasons for the political opposition e 
 social against this government, against all governments, the 7 masters 
 of the world that also want to do the G7 in Puglia - as it was in 
 Other G7, just remember the G7 of Genoa - their base of unity 
 To build war plans even more, the oppression plans 
 of the peoples, the plans for the immediation of peoples, the plans for use

  Yesterday, Monday February 26, Anti-Imperialist Action Ireland (AIA) reported on t
  <a href="https://anti-imperialist-action-ireland.com/blog/2024/02/26/mi5-attempt-to-question-republican-ex-pow/">
   he harassment of a former Republican prisoner of war from the occupied Six Counties
  </a>
  . In the news, AIA explains how they tried to intimidate the activist: by taking him to an interrogation room, where police dogs were also present. In the room, they tried to ask him questions for interrogation, including questions in relation to the Anti-Imperialist Action Ireland organization itself. The activist, knowing the strategy of MI5, the UK military intelligence service, refused to answer the questions.
 </p>
<p>
  AIA reports in its article how MI5 often tries to destroy the Republican movement by getting informants to learn about the activities of the movement. It also intimidates Republican activists, their families and eventually “to set Republican activists up” as they report. In their article, they also emphasize the necessity to uncover this strategy, since as they indicate in the article itself “The AIA commend this Republican ex-POW for coming forward. There is no shame in being approached by MI5, the shame is in engaging with or working with them.”
 </p>
<p>
  In a previous article, AIA reported that it had attended a presentation in the Law Department of NUIG Galway on the State’s use of

   Offences
  </a>
<a href="https://anti-imperialist-action-ireland.com/blog/2024/02/22/galway-aia-attend-conference-against-free-state-offences-against-the-state-act-and-special-courts/">
   Against the State Act
  </a>
  . In this presentation, where they discussed the use of these “draconian laws” to suppress the Republican Movement in Ireland, which is a threat to the State: “One speaker highlighted how Irish laws and the Offences Against the State act are entirely based around the high points of revolutionary Republican struggle in the country, and that, despite the red herring of organised crime, such powers remain distinctly politicised and to this day are used to suppress republican activity.”
 </p>
<p>
  In the presentation, different forms of repression used by the State were discussed, from courts without juries to intricacies of belief evidence in respect to ‘prescribed’ organisations. Thus, the State hinders the practice of basic democratic rights. AIA assures that it will continue to “campaign against the Free States Offences against the State Act and their Special Courts and highlight how such emergency powers are used to target Republican Activists. “

 There is one of the political themes one that has affected everyone in the latter 
 days, always within this battle for Palestine: they are the ignoble detective offices, the bloody faces of 
 girls, women, beaten with police manganelli under the 
 Rai headquarters in Turin as in Vicenza, in Naples and above all in Pisa. A 
 procession of the students has been made a sign of a repression that 
 Someone compared to that of the G8 of Genoa: beaten boys 
 from cowardly as the police are knowing when they come 
 built to do these things.

 Of course, beyond 
 of individual responsibilities - which are not few, because the 
 cops are fascists, they are worms, they are beasts and show what they are made of when they do 
 The bridle allies - those 
 policemen who have beaten are cowardly beasts who have fierce on disarmed young people but certainly not unwary and not 
 Certainly disarmed with a will of position.
 <p>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  They made it 
 dirty, the videos showed him without a shadow of doubt and in the newspapers 
 We have to read blocked ambulances, laugh during the barrels, 
 ostentation of violence, arrogance.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Guys treated 
 as criminals. From who? By the state criminals represented by 
 That charge stopped immediately by the protective cord. This time 
 The press could not help but fill the pages of complaints, 
 of photos. Some did very well to represent 
 actually the treatment reserved for beaten students. AND 
 Such an evident and scandalous thing that President Mattarella, 
 "Lady Pope" of this country, could not fail to stigmatize, 
 pronouncing words that evidently played to criticize the 
 police behavior, to the behavior of the Minister of 
 Interiors, to the government and advised the government not to pursue this 
 road because it could serve not so much to stop 
 Manifestations of young people but, in fact, the classic fire…. and who 
 He has a certain age he knows well how the situation ends.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But also 
 Mattarella was picked up in the face, in batons of 
 words, first of all represented by that raced dog called 
 Salvini who was able to declare without any modesty that those who criticize 
 The police are a criminal and therefore, in fact, he gave the criminal 
 Also to Mattarella himself.

 But apart from 
 some hesitation of the first day after these offices, the 
 Government yesterday claimed everything. Meloni: “The manganelli? Not 
 We apologize, this was by law ”.
 <p>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
<br>
  No, this is 
 police state, this is modern fascism, this is attack on 
 elementary principles of freedom, manifestation, thought and 
 action.

<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The prosecutors 
 They say: "Who gave the order?"
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But who had given 
 The order in Turin? Who had given order to Naples?
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Of course, if the 
 You can not do manifestations or you should do them a thousand miles away 
 where there are the symbols of these events, if it transforms each 
 manifestation in a kind of fence-lesson, it is clear that when 
 We want to free ourselves of these absurd prohibitions and affirm one 
 True and legitimate protest loads you with blows and then of complaints.

  In Pisa he is 
 I went badly because Pisa took the field the next day to defend 
 His boys, our boys.

  And even i 
 unions, which are usually embarrassing for their silence, not 
 they were not able to say "enough with the manganelli" and that the minister 
 you have to resign. But the request for resignation of the minister 
 He showed the nature of this government.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  These ministers 
 they do not resign, Dalmastro did not resign, he did not resign the 
 Santanchè, that kind of caricature of minister does not resign 
 Which is lollobrigida, all these dirty people do not resign, 
 filthy, fascists inside and above all rich and corrupt they do 
 part of the system of the rich and corrupt in this country, of 
 parasites and therefore do not resign because they know that that system are linked to that system 
 With an umbilical cord, they are the sognale mice returned to power 
 that they keep their hand and will not go in front of anything and perhaps 
 They can't go with their feet.

<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Here, Pisa 
 shows that state violence - the police state - is one 
 of the forms of the modern fascism of this government and that for this 
 You have to fight it.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Fight it, fight it, fight it.

<p>
  On the 26
  <sup>
   th
  </sup>
  of February at least 900 farmers
  <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/feb/26/farmers-protests-brussels-eu-agriculture-leaders-riot-police">
   gathered
  </a>
  in the European Quarter of Brussels, where many EU institutions have their headquarters, to protest against the increasing production costs, cheap imports from outside of EU and EU rules on agriculture made under the pretense of achieving “climate-neutrality”. The protesters clashed with police,
  <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/us/protesting-farmers-spray-brussels-police-with-liquid-manure-near-eu-s-base-in-a-new-display-of-power/ar-BB1iV2Uw">
   spraying liquid manure on them
  </a>
  , throwing eggs and bottles at them, and constructing flaming barricades out of tires and bales of hay. The police used tear gas and water cannons to repress the protesters. At the same time, agricultural ministers of the EU countries met and discussed cosmetic “improvements” to the rules. The protesters expressed their anger at their income becoming more and more insecure and at the ministers who do not understand the reality of the farmers.
 </p>
<p>
  The clashes were part of the wave of protests which has swiped over Europe, on which we have
  <a href="https://redherald.org/2024/02/11/the-farmer-demonstrations-in-europe-extend-to-spain/">
   written earlier.
  </a>
  Despite the demands of the protesters are often targeted towards reforms in the EU rules or for more State subsidies, what is expressed in severe problems of imperialism in crisis.
 </p>
<p>
  The action in Brussels, as many others, is especially targeted against the EU, whose measures further benefit the monopolies and especially German imperialism as a dominant power in the EU.
 </p>
<p>
  Amid the rising prices, the costs are put on the “consumers” and the farmers, who do not see the increasing prices of food in their income, while the monopolies make incredible profits. Protests took place on Monday also on the Polish-German border, where the highway was blocked from both sides by the peasants and farmers of the two countries, and in Madrid in front of EU offices in the Spanish State. In Brussels, farmers from Portugal, the Spanish State and Italy joined the farmers of Belgium.

</figure>
<p>
  In the meeting of the agricultural ministers in Brussels, very little concrete measures were introduced, only talk and promises of “change” to attempt to pacify the protests. The ministers were clear that they would not abandon the CAP (Common Agricultural Policy), only make “adjustments”. What is seen clearly is that the EU is an instrument to put the farmers and peasants against each other to benefit especially the German monopolies.
 </p>
<p>
  The protest yesterday in Brussels is one of the examples of the struggle of the farmers overcoming the bourgeois legality and displaying the explosiveness of the situation. At the same time it can be seen that all over Europe, the peasants and farmers share demands despite some national particularities, and are developing international solidarity between protests, which are increasingly targeted against the EU.

<p>
  This Sunday, February 25, La Cause du Peuple called for commemorating the heroes of the proletariat of France. Like every year, this commemorative event aimed to honor Pierre Overney, revolutionary worker, seller of La Cause du Peuple. On February 25, 1972, while Pierrot was having the hard experience of forced unemployment, fired from Renault for political reasons, he took part in an action to distribute leaflets in front of the factory to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the Charonne subway massacre, a demonstration which followed the massacre of October 17, 1961 where the French police massively suffocated Algerians. After his death, class solidarity was immense, and more than 200,000 people walked in a long procession behind his coffin in early March 1972.
 </p>
<p>
  We also paid special tribute to the heroes of the Manouchian Group (FTP-MOI), giving their lives for the Communist Party and the Revolution 80 years ago. In addition to a speech, two letters were read to the comrades present. The first is composed of extracts from Missak Manouchian’s letter to Mélinée, his wife, before her death. She demonstrates all her internationalism and heroism. The second is a letter from the Bulgarian worker Lutibrodsky, sentenced to death by the dictatorship in 1934, to his father. This letter was distributed in thousands of copies at the time as an example of the relentless struggle against the bourgeoisie and fascism. The demonstration, starting from the Père Lachaise metro station, therefore passed by the grave of Pierrot, then to Szlama Grzywacz’s one, communist fighter, Polish Jew and member of the Manouchian Group, who was shot on February 21, 1944.
 </p>
<p>
  We are publishing here photos of the event, which attracted the attention and sympathy of passers-by and employees of Père Lachaise [Translator’s note: a cemetery in Paris], mobilizing many supporters of our newspaper. We will very soon publish the speech and the letters that were read on this occasion.

  <strong>
   Germany's newest right party
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  Thomas Klikauer ve Danny Antonelli*
 </p>
<p>
  The former boss of the Internal Intelligence Organization BFV [a kind of Western-German Stasi] and the extreme right-wing Hans-Georg Maaßen, an open-o'clock Jewish, founded a new extreme right-wing political party surrounded by threatening and bully-looking security guards at the end of February 2024 . His party's name is Werte Union or Union of Values.
 </p>
<p>
  Just like Alexander Gauland of Alexander Gauland, who founded AFD to challenge the CDU, Maaßen's one -man show wants to challenge the Conservative CDU, Germany's traditional right.
 </p>
<p>
  Unlike eleven years of Neo-Nazi AFD, the newly established Union of Values is challenging Gauland's Neo-Nazi Afd.
 </p>
<p>
  Maaßen's new party CDU's fashion is operating under “Freedom instead of Socialism”. The party moves with paranoia with a McCarthy -style “Reds under the beds”.
 </p>
<p>
  This phenomenon has been known since Hofstadter in 1964 in Harper’s Magazine on political paranoia.
 </p>
<p>
  Strangely, Maaßen and a few followers gathered on a small boat on the Rhine near Remagen for the establishment of his party. This was a quite isolated place that was not allowed to enter journalists or people.
 </p>
<p>
  Maaßen's single-man show- with reactionaries close to fascism- wants to attract the far-right voters on the right of Merkel's and Merz's party CDU.
 </p>
<p>
  Hans-Georg Maaßen was elected as the party president unanimously and unanimously, as expected from a carbon copy on the far-right of Germany.
 </p>
<p>
  In fact, Maaßen's real plan was to return to Bonn, the former German capital of Germany to establish its party. After all, this was the city where he was a law student and later in the German Ministry of Interior within the scope of the secret bribery fund of the former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, which was ruled by the CDU since 1991.
 </p>
<p>
  Kohl's ideological successor Angela Merkel, Maaßen, Germany's internal intelligence organization and official name of the Constitutional Conservation Department (BFV) brought the head of the institution.
 </p>
<p>
  In 2018, Maaßen was dismissed after doubting the presence of Neo-Nazi uprising in Chemnitz. It's not a coincidence, Chemnitz is also the hometown of Germany's worst neo-nazi killer team after World War II. Maaßen has a history of ignoring German Neo-Nazi terrorism.
 </p>
<p>
  Meanwhile, internal intelligence services are investigating the former boss as a suspicious person who may be linked to extreme right. Just a few weeks after its establishment, Maaßen's Union of Values began to establish the purpose of being established using online platforms to attack CDU and party leader Friedrich Merz. The main objectives of the Union of Values of both party and leader Maaßen.
 </p>
<p>
  Merz's “on the wrong way” is mentioned in the shares of Facebook and X (Twitter). And he says that CDU has forgotten that he had already worked in the tradition of “Adenauer and Kohl's CDU tradition, as it was once.
 </p>
<p>
  The Union of Values explained that in order to camouflage its extreme rightism, it is “official” as “freedom, the superiority of law and the basic law of Germany's constitutional order”. These are important for three reasons:
 </p>
<p>
  Democracy: The Union of Values must show that Germany is a democratic political party to Germany's internal intelligence, despite the defense of radical authoritarianism and the pursuit of military dictatorship.
 </p>
<p>
  Academics: The Union of Values must also act as a democratic party for innocent, pure and easy deceitable academics and academics. This is exactly why no negative report about the party is made in an academic journal. As in the AFD example, this will give good results; and finally:
 </p>
<p>
  Voters: The Union of Values should convince the voters- and all potential voters coming from other parties- from Germany's conservatives (eg CDU). This will be very useful, because most conservatives are not worried about democracy. If they think of power and how to get it, they include a Machtergreifung (seizing power).
 </p>
<p>
  The website of the Union of Values is structured to reflect the three basic points summarized above. Furthermore, Maaßen says, “We just want to go back to the future,” he says.
 </p>
<p>
  Anyone who watches the classic film will understand that this is the password of going to a timely 30 years ago ”, even further before the lost war, a time when a single party is a nation of iron.
 </p>
<p>
  Maaßen also says that the future depends on values. Apparently, this means the recycling of the values that once made the “Old Germany strong strong, that is, that makes the old CDU strong. However, considering the tendency to anti-democratic administration alone, this is a trick.
 </p>
<p>
  Maaßen's Party Plan does not aim to cope with the problems we face today and especially we will face tomorrow: an uninhabitable world, as the UN Guterres states, 6. Mass destruction, “We are still in a car that goes to the climate hell. "
 </p>
<p>
  The plan of the Maaßen party is to opposite ideologically directed energy policies and to oppose “climate neutrality goals için for the year 2050. Instead, he argues that “the reconstruction of low -cost base load [coal] power plants and the potentially re -operation of the non -service nuclear facilities”.
 </p>
<p>
  It is likely that such a plan will lead Germany to the abyss of Dante's global hell. It is unlikely that Germany will lead to any happy future.
 </p>
<p>
  The Union of Values is the second new party founded by a well -known person this year. Sahara was the first of the Wagenknecht alliance. With Maaßen's Union of Values and the emergence of BSW, many people said, "Is there a tendency towards the extreme parties?" he wonders. "Is this a repetition of the last days of the Weimar Republic?"
 </p>
<p>
  This scenario resulted in the creation of Auschwitz, the most hellish place of our world, and more than 44,000 concentration camps.
 </p>
<p>
  Yes. You read the figure correctly. 44,000. Among these camps were death camps: “The first camp opened in December 1941 was Chelmno, where Jews and novels were killed by gas in mobile gas minibuses.
 </p>
<p>
  In 1942, the Nazis opened Belzec, Sobibor and Treblinka death centers. ” It can be thought that Maaßen's Union of Values is the closest party to the German National People's Party, the German National People's Party, and even helps Weimar's anti-democratic deutschnationale Volkspartei (DNVP), the German National People's Party.
 </p>
<p>
  In the 1930s, DNVP presented Volksgemeinschaft, who was dedicated to a powerful leader who aimed to eliminate all social classes in favor of Aryan Volk.
 </p>
<p>
  DNVP was one of the main authoritarian parties of Weimar Germany (1918-1933). In 1928, DNVP shifted to the right radical to the right after the press baron Alfred Hugenberg was controlled.
 </p>
<p>
  This was supported by a turbo charging by Ultra-Militarist Stahlhelm. In 1933, the DNVP was excited to join Hitler's coalition government.
 </p>
<p>
  With the Union of Values is a kind of “new DNVP” on the horizon, Germany seems to have become a part of the world's right -wing tendency in recent years. This means that Germany's great parties have lost a significant amount of voters.
 </p>
<p>
  This magic number was accompanied by the disintegration of the political landscape of Germany, and the political field filled with smaller and generally quite marginal parties that draw the discontent and ignorant from the mainstream parties. Maaßen and its Union of Values are another indication that these small parties have multiplied but not individually strengthened.
 </p>
<p>
  The Union of Values DNVP wants to participate in the state elections to be held in Thülingen, Saxony and Brandenburg in September this year. The registration periods for the European elections in June 2024 have already expired, so this time there is no such competition.
 </p>
<p>
  In the east, the party is likely to position the party on the right of the CDU, similar to the DNVP in the early 1930s. These 3 states will compete with AFD, BSW and many small local parties.
 </p>
<p>
  The most dangerous in terms of the division of right -wing votes parties such as anti -vaccine diebasis; The right -wing parties group under the flag of BFT, also known as Thuringen Free Voters; BDB/FW, a mixture of the BD alliance and free voters and others in Brandenburg, with its members in Germany.
 </p>
<p>
  The Union of Values wants to show a smiling face as if it were CDU's willing partner. In the 1930s, Maaßen de Neo-Nazi AFD, who met Hitler's Nazi party, announced that he was “ready to meet” with AFD.
 </p>
<p>
  Maaßen's plan is to break voters from both parties and fill the gap between the conservative CDU and the Neo-Nazi Afd.
 </p>
<p>
  Maaßen lives in a political hallucination. The cliff between the non-progressive CDU and outright Neo-Nazi AFD, which he thinks are separated from the path of conservative values, is not a cliff. It is more like a small crack, maybe a fault line. Maaßen tells the public that AFD is a bit too radical.
 </p>
<p>
  For strategic reasons, Maaßen continues to see both the CDU and AFD as potential partners that will strengthen its political position.
 </p>
<p>
  The Union of Values aims to seize Germany's small bourgeoisie, conservatives, believers on the free market, national liberals, and even more ideological libertarians on the conservative side of Germany's classical social democrats (SPD). He also imagines that he can attract voters from the SPD's conservative wing, the Helmut Schmidt wing.
 </p>
<p>
  Ten years ago, this segment received support with Thilo Sarrazin's right -wing propaganda, which implied the Popular theme of the West, a popular theme of German reactionary thought since Oswald Spenger.
 </p>
<p>
  Maaßen's same-poisonous companions, the former Vice-Admiral Alexander Mitsch, Kay-Achim Schönbach (German militarism is never far from the combination of the extreme right) and former CDU deputy and former electric technician Albert Weiler represents all these various stances.
 </p>
<p>
  The draft of the establishment program of the Union of Values includes expressions in a very similar language in Neo-Nazi AFD's program. This is not something new either. In the 1930s, the DNVP had a similar language to Hitler's Nazi party. Historically, most of them are not new.
 </p>
<p>
  The Union of Values says, “We are in favor of the collapse of the party state and the expansion of popular sovereignty”. It is in favor of the introduction of plebicitarian elements such as referendum. Similarly, we want to give the right to vote against the laws agreed by the Parliament, Af says AFD. The current parliamentary democracy system will be eliminated or restricted.
 </p>
<p>
  Hans-Georg Maaßen, who moves from the same fascist game book with Trump, Putin and AFD, is the camp of Germany's progressive and environmentalists, despised and hated.
 </p>
<p>
  It positions as “left-green camp”. During the DNVP (1930s), the imaginary enemy was KPD.
 </p>
<p>
  Today, this location is occupied by Germany's environmental party Greens (we can tolerate capitalism). The Greens are passionately hated for advocating critical thinking by the Union of Values of CDU, Maaßen's reactionary wing, and further by Neo-Nazi AFD, and implements real programs that will benefit the environment.
 </p>
<p>
  Right -wing populists always need an enemy where they can demonize and ultimately kill without any conscientious intervention. This is not even a new thing. Nazi Party member Carl Schmitt - NSDAP Mitgliedsnummer: 2,098,860 - Since they advocated the completely destruction of the enemy, all right -wing authoritarians have included this belief in their canons.
 </p>
<p>
  Meanwhile, authoritarian Hans-Georg Maaßen continues to be a very controversial person. Although Maaßen acted as a traditionalist and introduced himself as the protector of Adenauer and Kohl's CDU, he is not aware of neither in the 1950s nor in the 1980s (Kohl).
 </p>
<p>
  What makes Maaßen a dangerous reaction is this call to a nostalgic past that has never happened. He wants to return the clock a few decades, maybe before 1945.
 </p>
<p>
  A light of hope is that a party, which is often decided by a few hundred and white men to its establishment, cannot cope with the difficulties of the modern election market.
 </p>
<p>
  Who would want an old agent that really fell out of sight to take over anything? Especially someone who has a fashioned cold war ideology that wants to live in the past. Without Tiktok and Youtube? MY GOD!

<p>
  Unfortunately, things that once had real nightmares in election campaigns are dressed as pastoral dreams of their once -glorious past, dressing new glittering costumes. Nihilist authoritarian parties can never create positive plans for the future.
 </p>
<p>
  As Sex Pistols declared: There is no future under fascist regimes. The Maaßen and the Union of Values promises “a change of direction in almost all central policy areas ..
 </p>
<p>
  Behind this war, an authoritarian and harsh internal policy is hidden in a strict and reactionary social policy that makes little mercy on the weak. This is Hitler's “Volksgemeinschaft 2.0 ..
 </p>
<p>
  Of course, in order to stay in the same line with his friends on the right, this includes a very restrictive migration policy that should not even have compassion for minors. AFD had actually argued that the refugee was shot at the borders of Germany.
 </p>
<p>
  Pressure will also be made for the assimilation of immigrants. Either they adapt to our Volksgemeinschaft or they go away. The bell that AFD stole is playing a very similar bell. It is also colored with strong positions against Islam, even with real hostility towards religion and followers.
 </p>
<p>
  Avandland evokes the images of Abendland, which should be defended against non -bee. Here, too, the Union of Values is once again close to AFD. Almost an old speech of the DNVP of the 1930s or Hitler's Nazi party can be taken and the word “Jewish” can be changed with “Muslim ..
 </p>
<p>
  The people around Maaßen- and Maaßen has no real problems with Neo-Nazi Afd. Rather, there is a so -called “violent criticism öz for all positions to the left of the socialist, communist and Maaßen called“ extreme leftist ..
 </p>
<p>
  Maaßen's election strategy is that if AFD approaches the majority of parliament in the upcoming Eastern state elections, Maaßen's Union of Values (if they manage to enter any state parliament) will help AfD to come to power.
 </p>
<p>
  Just as DNVP was once Hitler's volunteer executioners, today there will be voluntary executioners that will carry Neo-Nazi Afd to power.
 </p>
<p>
  There are signs that there is a political gap between the conservative CDU and the Neo-Nazi Afd. Maaßen's reactionary values union is watered in the hope that they can fill this gap.
 </p>
<p>
  In September this year, the state elections to be held in Thuringen, Saxony and Brandenburg will show whether Maaßen's affordable attempt to establish a third political party on the far right of Germany will be successful.
 </p>

  Vienna | 27.02.2024 | On February 23, on the 4th day of the massacre of 5 women, another woman became the victim of the patriarchal mentality.
  <br aria-hidden="true">
<br aria-hidden="true">
  While the protests of the massacres continued, on February 26, the Austrian press was shaken by the news that a woman was killed by a man except Vienna. Especially the pandemi process and increasing violence, harassment and women's massacres are increasing day by day.
  <br aria-hidden="true">
<br aria-hidden="true">
  At 18:00 on February 26th, “We don't want to decrease another person” and the rally was held in Vienna, which was attended by hundreds of people. The anger of the audience participating in the action was reflected in the slogans.
  <br aria-hidden="true">
<br aria-hidden="true">
  In the speeches, especially the Austrian Government and the Ministry of Justice, the Minister of Justice, "you protect women instead of protecting your system, racism by direct targeting immigrants by directing the racist fascist party FPO policy," the statement said.
  <br aria-hidden="true"/>
<br aria-hidden="true"/>
  Especially women came to the microphone and said, ik We had to leave our country from the wars you created, we have no safety in Europe, we have no safety of violence, we came every day we lived daily, I came when I was five years old, then my father was a reliable country, but today is a reliable country. I shout here, I don't have my safety, yes, because we know that no one has the right law in the male -dominated system, we scream on the streets. Today, a thousand people are here, we will be in thousands of squares from now on. We do not leave the streets empty against your racist fascist policy ”.
  <br aria-hidden="true"/>
<br aria-hidden="true"/>
  Walking with the slogans thrown, the cortege was massacred in front of the local, after the leaving candles in front of the local and the speeches of the families, "Jin Jiyan Azadi, Freedom of Women Life" ended with the slogans.

     The struggles and unity grow
    </strong>
</span>
</h3>
<p>
   The days of the social movements last week, with 500 road cuts throughout the country were starring thousands and thousands that showed empty pots, claiming food delivery for more than 44 thousand popular dining rooms, increased social plans and social plans and Help for the start of classes. They thus put the growth of the struggles and the drama of hunger that deepens with the policy of Milei again put in the center of the political scene.
  </p>
<p>
   On Wednesday 21, the guild of railway machinists made a national strike in the absence of salary offer in the peers. The next day he stopped the health union, denouncing "the intransigence of business chambers."
  </p>
<p>
   The Youth Day of February 22 in front of the National Secretariat of Education, convened by political and social organizations such as the CCC Youth, not a kid less for drugs, strain, Mus, JCR and many many Other organizations showed a youth that is planted to demand the delivery of 500 thousand school kits to guarantee the start of classes with the slogan "The pots are empty, the backpacks too."
  </p>
<p>
   On Monday 26, coinciding with the beginning of classes in many provinces, the Confederation of Education Workers of the Argentine Republic (CTERA) ordered a national unemployment in claim of the National Joint and in protest to the elimination of the National Teaching Incentive Fund (Fonid). In many provinces there were joint mobilizations of state, health workers and teachers.
  </p>
<p>
   The ATE also convened a national strike for the National Public Administration on the same 26.
  </p>
<p>
   On Tuesday 27, a set of organizations between which is our PTP-PCR and the CCC promoted a “sovereign and oath to the flag” in Rosario, in defense of sovereignty.
  </p>
<p>
   For Wednesday 28, three aeronautical unions announced a national strike, given the ridiculous salary offer of Aerolineas Argentinas and Intercargo, which implies a salary loss of 70% against inflation.
  </p>
<p>
   The march in defense of the Banco Nación, the struggle of the oil tankers of Comodoro Rivadavia, are the reflection of the growth of the workers' struggles, peasants, women and young people, of natives, of workers of culture and science, and other popular sectors that travel the country facing the brutal adjustment, the delivery of national sovereignty and the repression of Milei and its government.
  </p>
<p>
   The development of multisectoral, the growth of unity and good conditions for coordination are a distinctive feature of this moment.
  </p>
<p>

<strong>
     Changes in the political scenario
    </strong>
</span>
</h3>
<p>
   Milei-Villaruel's government policy that promotes the "model" of the landowner oligarchy that threw butter into the roof and handled the country into blood and fire, now launches an offensive against the provinces, reissued the confrontation between "unit and federal." The model that claims Milei
   <strong>
    It is the oligarchic regime that ruled Argentina from 1880 to 1916.
   </strong>
</p>
<p>
   Faced with this policy, popular and multisectoral struggles are joining more sectors every day, and the fights deepen in the dominant classes block, in this Argentina fiercely played by the imperialist powers. These disputes grew with the political crisis caused by the institutional coup attempt of the Government, in Congress, demanding a “buse” that until now, the product of the popular struggle, has not been able to approve.
  </p>
<p>
   Gita Gopinath, number two of the IMF, came to monitor the agreement and continuity of infamous debt payments.
  </p>
<p>
   Now Milei seeks to take over the funds of the provinces, to continue with their delivery and adjustment policy.
  </p>
<p>
   They took over the funds that, by law, are distributed between the nation and the provinces. And just as they do not allocate a single weight on the purchase of food from popular dining rooms, the government "makes cash" with money for health, education, transport and public works.
  </p>
<p>
   The Argentine Institute of Fiscal Analysis (Iaraf) published a report detailing how the adjustment imposed by the Government in public spending is. It fell 39.4% year -on -year in January, making items for retirement and pensions and energy subsidies.
  </p>
<p>
   Now he also took funds by decree to the province of Buenos Aires, and reduced from 30% to 1% The popular neighborhoods.
  </p>
<p>
   The governor of Tierra del Fuego Gustavo Melella announced that he will paralyze oil production for 24 hours in solidarity with the governor of Chubut.
  </p>
<p>
   As the statement of our party says “we fight the unity so that the struggles progress, today with the aim of twist unemployment, the delivery of national sovereignty and repression to popular struggles. ”
  </p>
<p>
<strong>
</strong>
</p>

<strong>
     Milei, servant of oligarchs and imperialists
    </strong>
</span>
</h3>
<p>
   San Martín, Belgrano, Güemes and Artigas raised funds for the war against Spain from the riches of the oligarchy that denied them, and that they sent their slaves to prevent their children from going to the liberating armies. So much so that the Salteña oligarchy ordered Güemes to kill. Milei and his heirs are servants of the heirs of that handful of landowners. While the caste of landowners, export monopolies and IMF usurers take money like never before, the working class and the people suffer as never before the crisis with the reduction of salaries, retirement, social plans, health expenses, education, education, services, transport, etc.
  </p>
<p>
   Each measure has a sector benefited with name and surname. They pounce with negotiated by putting everything they can, destroying the educational, health, cultural, research, defense, security, etc.
  </p>
<p>
   With the Chubutenses oil unions in struggle, the discount of Chubut's co -participate funds and the response of the governors of Patagonia rushed this political crisis. This was expressed in the act convened by the oil unions before the announcement of the companies that would withdraw funds from the wells of the region to allocate them to Vaca Muerta. There, the Chubutense governor Ignacio Torres, of the PRO, announced that if the National Government does not return to the province the funds they owe them, they will paralyze the export of gas and oil.
  </p>
<p>
   The six governors of the South Argentina supported the Chubutense decision. They signed a statement where they ratified that "no one can submit or extort them with threats to restrictions."
  </p>
<p>
   Faced with Milei's offensive, the solidarity of most governors advanced.

     The popular struggle deepens the dispute above
    </strong>
</span>
</h3>
<p>
   The political crisis, deepened by the growth of popular struggles and the speed with which the provinces joined in their claim, unleashed a zafarrancho above.
  </p>
<p>
   Macri would have asked for two days to try a negotiation, but failed. Patricia Bullrich, who traveled to Washington, said from there: "In March or April they hang us from the Plaza de Mayo or, if we pass, Argentina will be a power." Bullrich formally remains the president of the PRO, and although she plays as part of the Milei government, she cultivated a deal with not a few governorates for the change. But now, before the position of the governors, Bullrich questioned that decision and began to gather signatures of the PRO in favor of Javier Milei and against what he called the "blackmail" of Ignacio Torres.
  </p>
<p>
   Given these statements of Bullrich, the PRO was even more divided, with Macri willing to take its presidency, and those who have been encouraging the possibility of an “institutional coup” with a temporary succession of the vice president, Victoria Villarruel, were reactivated.
  </p>
<p>
   Meanwhile, Milei, who traveled to Israel on February 6 and cried on the regrets, now after meeting with the Secretary of State of the Yankee Democratic Government, Antony Blinken, traveled to the United States and flirts with Trump, to whom He said they would meet again being the two presidents.
  </p>

<strong>
     We fight for a new active national strike
    </strong>
</span>
</h3>
<p>
   The overwhelming unemployment of January 24 that covered the entire country and the great struggles of the occupied labor movement that continue to grow, put the working class in the center of the political scene.
  </p>
<p>
   The mobilizations against hunger this week, with the immense days of popular pots and road cuts throughout the country, united all social organizations, facing the hunger and repression policy of Milei and its minister Sandra Pettovello.
  </p>
<p>
   The political debate grows and is expressed in the sections of the factories, in the countryside, the neighborhoods, workplaces, study and among the different popular sectors.
  </p>
<p>
   The criminal policy towards retirees that puts them as a adjustment variable, since according to Milei “they are the least poor sector”, add millions of this sector to the fight that want to go to the streets to defend their rights.
  </p>
<p>
   This policy that destroys production adds to the struggle to large sectors of national bourgeoisie that go bankrupt with the measures of this government.
  </p>
<p>
   The antinational and submission measures to the governments of the United States, England and Israel fighting the patriotism of our people.
  </p>
<p>
   The women's movement that has been fighting is preparing to claim the International Worker Women's Day on March 8 in the streets of the whole country.
  </p>
<p>
<strong>
    The conditions to fight a new active national unemployment that one to all these sectors grow and follow the pair path of January 24.
   </strong>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">
<strong>

    </strong>
<strong>
     Prepare and prepare the masses
    </strong>
</span>
</h3>
<p>
   The depth of the food crisis, also the health, economic, growth of drug mafias and trafficking, the total absence of national defense is brutal.
  </p>
<p>
   The government, which started with a brutal devaluation in December, advances with its adjustment and delivery plan, responding to the interests of the most reactionary sectors of the ruling classes block.
  </p>
<p>
   A recent CAME report (Argentine Confederation of the medium -sized company) indicates that food consumption lowered by 37% and food production by 22%. The consumption of medicines fell 45%, and dropped general industrial production by 30%.
  </p>
<p>
   From the beginning our party and its JCR promotes the need to face this policy, working for the broadest unity of the workers and popular sectors, even with many of Milei's voters, affected by their policy.
  </p>
<p>
   Milei and his allies, with their policy, bet to deepen the political, economic, cultural and social division in our homeland.
  </p>
<p>
   We stay at the forefront of popular emergencies and against delivery and repression, and from there we work to expand unity, because giving them time is allowing Milei to advance with their measures, which will only worsen the situation of The great masses.
  </p>
<p>
   Day by day a situation is accelerated in which the conjunction of various factors "can generate an objective revolutionary situation," as the central committee of our PCR affirmed in early January.
  </p>
<p>
   They are tumultuous moments where great changes can occur, in which we work so that the multisectoral for the fight multiplies, fighting to be true coordinating centers of the working and popular struggle, and thus twist the arm to Milei's policy to advance in conquering another policy and another government, in favor of the people.
  </p>
<p>
   This requires advancing in the accumulation of revolutionary forces, incorporating thousands into the PCR and the JCR, offering them a struggle. It is our duty to prepare and prepare the masses so that these changes are in favor of the working class and the people and open a revolutionary path.
  </p>
<p>
   For this way we reinforce the diffusion of our weekly, which arrives at 2000 editions this week.
  </p>
<p>
<strong>
    And we continue to pay tributes to our dear Otto Vargas, first general secretary of our party, five years after his death, which are a central part of reaffirming those revolutionary objectives, the same for which we founded our party 56 years ago.
