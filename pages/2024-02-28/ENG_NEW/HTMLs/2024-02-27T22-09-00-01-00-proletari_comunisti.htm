 There is one of the political themes one that has affected everyone in the latter 
 days, always within this battle for Palestine: they are the ignoble detective offices, the bloody faces of 
 girls, women, beaten with police manganelli under the 
 Rai headquarters in Turin as in Vicenza, in Naples and above all in Pisa. A 
 procession of the students has been made a sign of a repression that 
 Someone compared to that of the G8 of Genoa: beaten boys 
 from cowardly as the police are knowing when they come 
 built to do these things.

 Of course, beyond 
 of individual responsibilities - which are not few, because the 
 cops are fascists, they are worms, they are beasts and show what they are made of when they do 
 The bridle allies - those 
 policemen who have beaten are cowardly beasts who have fierce on disarmed young people but certainly not unwary and not 
 Certainly disarmed with a will of position.
 <p>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  They made it 
 dirty, the videos showed him without a shadow of doubt and in the newspapers 
 We have to read blocked ambulances, laugh during the barrels, 
 ostentation of violence, arrogance.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Guys treated 
 as criminals. From who? By the state criminals represented by 
 That charge stopped immediately by the protective cord. This time 
 The press could not help but fill the pages of complaints, 
 of photos. Some did very well to represent 
 actually the treatment reserved for beaten students. AND 
 Such an evident and scandalous thing that President Mattarella, 
 "Lady Pope" of this country, could not fail to stigmatize, 
 pronouncing words that evidently played to criticize the 
 police behavior, to the behavior of the Minister of 
 Interiors, to the government and advised the government not to pursue this 
 road because it could serve not so much to stop 
 Manifestations of young people but, in fact, the classic fire…. and who 
 He has a certain age he knows well how the situation ends.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But also 
 Mattarella was picked up in the face, in batons of 
 words, first of all represented by that raced dog called 
 Salvini who was able to declare without any modesty that those who criticize 
 The police are a criminal and therefore, in fact, he gave the criminal 
 Also to Mattarella himself.

 But apart from 
 some hesitation of the first day after these offices, the 
 Government yesterday claimed everything. Meloni: “The manganelli? Not 
 We apologize, this was by law ”.
 <p>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  <br/>
  No, this is 
 police state, this is modern fascism, this is attack on 
 elementary principles of freedom, manifestation, thought and 
 action.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The prosecutors 
 They say: "Who gave the order?"
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But who had given 
 The order in Turin? Who had given order to Naples?
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Of course, if the 
 You can not do manifestations or you should do them a thousand miles away 
 where there are the symbols of these events, if it transforms each 
 manifestation in a kind of fence-lesson, it is clear that when 
 We want to free ourselves of these absurd prohibitions and affirm one 
 True and legitimate protest loads you with blows and then of complaints.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  In Pisa he is 
 I went badly because Pisa took the field the next day to defend 
 His boys, our boys.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  And even i 
 unions, which are usually embarrassing for their silence, not 
 they were not able to say "enough with the manganelli" and that the minister 
 you have to resign. But the request for resignation of the minister 
 He showed the nature of this government.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  These ministers 
 they do not resign, Dalmastro did not resign, he did not resign the 
 Santanchè, that kind of caricature of minister does not resign 
 Which is lollobrigida, all these dirty people do not resign, 
 filthy, fascists inside and above all rich and corrupt they do 
 part of the system of the rich and corrupt in this country, of 
 parasites and therefore do not resign because they know that that system are linked to that system 
 With an umbilical cord, they are the sognale mice returned to power 
 that they keep their hand and will not go in front of anything and perhaps 
 They can't go with their feet.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Here, Pisa 
 shows that state violence - the police state - is one 
 of the forms of the modern fascism of this government and that for this 
 You have to fight it.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Fight it, fight it, fight it.
