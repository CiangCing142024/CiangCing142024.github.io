   According to the Middle East Eye by residents 
 Palestinians, the famine in the north of Gaza, caused by the siege 
 asphyxiating of Israel, has reached extreme levels. They were 
 several reports of people who have been dead due to malnutrition, 
 including newborn life of over half a million people wheel 
 now every day around a single task: find something from 
 eat. In the following article,
   <a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/starvation-gaza-if-we-stay-another-week-we-will-die-en-masse" target="_blank">
    a 
 resident of Gaza City (who preferred to remain anonymous) tells 
 Lubna Masarwa of Mee

   The struggle to survive in a city 
 devastated by the war.

  The situation is really hard. Get any 
 What has become an impossible task, even for first assets 
 needs such as sugar, salt and rice. We continue to look for them 
 Everywhere, even in old shops and abandoned houses. If it's 
 When, we can find them in the shops, they are sold at prices 
 crazy. About four days ago 800 bags of flour arrived 
 wheat of 25 kg each. Counting that in the north of Gaza there are 
 Almost 700,000 people, this means a lot every 1,000 inhabitants. 
 My cousin is among those who managed to get one. He has 
 distributed fair parts to

 our family, to each one kilo of 
 Flour. Like everyone in Gaza, my sister and I mixed the 
 our ration with corn flour and soy, in order to increase its 
 amount. I spent three hours in the morning to light the fire and 
 Cooking the dough, but the final result was not good. Era 
 Hard, raw and had a strange flavor. My sister started a 
 cry, I tried to calm her down saying that we could add us 
 of the thyme to flavor it and eat it like this. In the day they are then 
 gone to my uncles, to try to help them turn on a fire 
 With the little wood left in Gaza, of bad quality. We have it 
 Employed more than three hours. Uncle did not seem to me in shape. I have him 
 He asked what he didn't go and he didn't answer. Later, his 
 son told me he hadn't eaten to leave his ration 
 of food to children, he was weak. At the end of this long day e 
 tiring, an air attack hit very close to ours 
 homes. I was terrified, we missed that they took 
 we too.

  Gaza is at the limit of forces. The situation is 
 Very serious and things worsen day by day. We are beyond the 
 famine. In recent months I have become so fragile. I was a boy 
 healthy, I went on horseback and ran. Now I can't even go up the 
 stairs without feeling exhausted. I completely forgot what flavor 
 They have foods like fruit or chicken. Until a few days ago we only had 
 Rice, and even that is now scarce. If you can find, a 
 kilo of rice costs 80 shekel (20 €), while before the war 
 It was worth 7 shekel (€ 1.80). We are finishing basic foods like oil 
 Kitchen, yeast, corn and barley. Also food for animals, which 
 We have often been forced to eat, it is almost totally 
 disappeared. Something ends every day. I know people who have 
 started eating wild herbs. If we remain like this for another 
 week, I think we will start seeing people with hungry in 
 mass. One thing is certain: there is nothing more in Gaza. People 
 Sane they get sick, the sick ones die. It doesn't matter if you have money or 
 No, if you have stored more food from the beginning of the war or not. 
 Everything is over, we cannot go around, we are all in the 
 same situation. Dying for bombs is better than starving. 
 At least with the air attacks you leave immediately. We are continuing to 
 turn and turn every day, just to find the bite you keep 
 standing.
