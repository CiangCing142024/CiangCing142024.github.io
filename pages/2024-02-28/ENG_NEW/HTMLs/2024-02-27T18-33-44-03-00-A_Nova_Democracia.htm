  On July 6, 2005, the United Nations Mission for Haiti Stabilization (MINUSTAH), led by the Brazilian Army and, specifically, by Augusto Heleno, undertook an operation called “Iron Fist”. From dawn to dusk for seven hours, the operation mobilized 440 soldiers, with a support of 41 armored and a helicopter; Community exits were blocked by soldiers. The injured were not taken to the hospital, but before, they were abandoned by the bloodthirsty troop. It is estimated that seven people were killed. Operation terrified Haiti and the world, and became known as Cité Soleil's massacre.
 </p>
 <p>
  Who followed the news of the operation of the Military Police (PM) in Rio de Janeiro, in the complexes of Maré, German and Penha, today, will have a feeling of
  <em>
   storyline vu
  </em>
  . What's more, those who live in a favela in any metropolis in Brazil will not be close to such brutality that had shocked the world, as it was unfortunately a scene very close to the daily life of the popular masses of large urban centers.
 </p>
 <p>
  The resemblance is no coincidence. Police forces are operationally responding to state governments, but as auxiliary and reserve forces of the reactionary army, are centralized by the high command of this genocidal institution. The Military Police General, the Army High Command organ, exercises the PMs doctrinal command, selects courses promotion tables, defines the warned war material and forms of organization.
 </p>
 <p>
  PMs perform, in the slums, the doctrine of
  <em>
   conflict
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   low -intensity war
  </em>
  . They establish a war conflict, with unconventional shapes, without mass and permanent mobilization of troops, but with more or less bulky operations in a restricted and calculated area symmetrically so as not to generate political commotion or resistance to the ongoing war. It is a form of
  <em>
   war
  </em>
  against the people, intending not to arouse resistance.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is what the Generals learned in Haiti. This is what they are practicing now in slums across the country, especially cariocas, through their auxiliary forces. The army does this without consideration for the verbiage of this or that shift government. This does not change, although there is always alternation of the party in the federal government. Large centers workers, slum residents, continue to die, while successive federal governments push responsibility to the state, because no one faces the secret government that works within the Armed Forces. As we see, in this republic, weapons send in politics.
