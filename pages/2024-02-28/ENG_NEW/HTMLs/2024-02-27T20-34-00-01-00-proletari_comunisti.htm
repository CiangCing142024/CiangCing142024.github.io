 On Friday and Saturday there have been two important days.
 <p>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Who does 12 o'clock 
 Counter -information rossusaia is first of all a proletarian 
 avant -garde, a communist militant, an activist of 
 trade union organizations, women's organizations, is a companion engaged in the fight against repression, war and, in 
 particular in all these last months, in solidarity to the people 
 Palestinian and therefore it is clear that his main commitment was this.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The instrument 
 Counter -information rossusaia is partly our voice but also 
 the tool to push avant -garde workers, workers, young people, 
 women to organize themselves with us, to participate in the events 
 important that take place in this country against imperialism, the 
 war in solidarity with Palestine, equally important of the 
 workers, struggles against exploitation in factories, the 
 cut of work, salary in factories, equally 
 important such as the fight against deaths at work.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  It is evident that 
 These two days deserved the total, national and local commitment, 
 With everything he entails: travel, leaflets, preparation of the 
 material that these 2 important days deserved. Two days 
 who saw 100,000 - and mostly workers - go down to 
 square in all forms: Friday strike was important for 
 example in the logistics sector, but also in some realities of 
 factories from Piaggio to other minors, who have seen 
 events and on some of which we will return separately.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Two days that 
 they saw principals under the prefectures, which saw various forms 
 with which first of all the workers took the field, they took 
 position and it is important that basic and class unionism, 
 In all its different acronyms, he collected the appeal of young people 
 Palestinians who, in tune with when it happens in the strip of 
 Gaza and in West, they had called a strike and a 
 events.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  It's important 
 that at national level there was a choice to make a 
 national event in Milan on the 24th, in the city that had been 
 theater for weeks and weeks, with tenacity and self -denial, of 
 events every Saturday. The "Palestinian Saturday", the 
 Saturday of "We are all Palestinians", the Saturday of “Milan is 
 A Palestinian city ". Of course, in many other cities and many 
 Other realities have been manifestations in recent months, but 
 Certainly in Milan the extra step was taken, that of making 
 the solidarity battle with Palestine as the main one 
 political-social battle in this country against imperialism, 
 Against our government complicit in genocide and imperialism.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  100,000 how not 
 They had been seen for years. Most of them participated in the 
 Milan event with a long procession, a river, a tide, 
 As women who struggle in these say in general 
 last years and they did it in a great way on November 25th 
 last year.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This time it was 
 The tide of left -wing militants and activists, yes, extreme 
 left, because the extreme left, the revolutionary left, 
 antagonist, of social opposition, is the main material force 
 in the internationalist solidarity struggle with Palestine, but also the 
 reserve that can change things within this country, in the 
 political struggle, in the real social opposition to governments and the 
 State of capital and in particular to this government that concentrates in 
 he all the reasons for this opposition.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  A long procession, 
 unitary, united. The thousand voices, the thousand slogans all went to one 
 same direction, with a truly contingent in the lead 
 impressive of Palestinians who led to this event 
 the "living meat" of what is happening in the strip of 
 Gaza, in Palestine, a radical opposition to the genocide, a 
 General reversal of the Canea of Infamy and lies that vomits 
 the press, television enslaved to the government, imperialism, 
 even enslaved to the Nazi of Israel Nazi Zionist.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This 
 event is a point of arrival - it is useless to deny it - of this 
 tenacious battle to overthrow the toxic narrative on Palestine 
 and to show that even in the heart of the imperialist countries 
 Internationalism means being united with oppressed peoples that yes 
 rebel, which rebel against weapons, which internationalism is support 
 unconditional, moral, social, political to resistance 
 Palestinian.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Enough with 
 genocide, support for Palestinian resistance. These two issues 
 They were at the center of this great event. In it all 
 they made their contribution, they brought their specificity: 
 First of all, the workers of class unionism of class, with the 
 contingent, large, impressive, of logistics workers, 
 A sector in permanent struggle in this country, organized 
 Essentially from Si Cobas but not only, and students, social centers and 
 Many small, medium and large communist political organizations 
 revolutionary.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  A procession that does not 
 Of course he looked to the past, but who began to think about the new 
 future fueled by Palestine, as, to give an example, it happened 
 In the 1970s with the importance of the battle on Vietnam, the 
 support for the liberation struggle of Vietnam, led by the party 
 Communist of
  <span style="text-decoration: none;">
   Ho Chi Minh
  </span>
  , 
 supported by China of Mao and all the anti -imperialist forces 
 social and political in the world that also constituted a wind - the wind 
 Eastern - which gradually fired the prairie or a part of 
 it within imperialist countries.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  In this 
 all manifestation and we also pose the problem of 
 How to continue. There have been proposals of continuity that come 
 from all sides and primarily by the Palestinians of our country.

  We too from 
 trucks that guided the manifestation of the Palestinians we said the 
 ours, as well as having done it with two banners they collected 
 The main word "against the genocide of the people 
 Palestinian by the Nazi Israel Nazi Zionist State/A 
 support of the Palestinian resistance ". But we also placed the 
 problem of opposition to war, because this was also 
 The great merit of the national event of Milan and the two 
 days that united solidarity with the Palestinian people and the 
 support for his resistance with the fight against war 
 imperialist, the wars of capital, understood as a way of production, 
 system of states and governments that produce the march towards the war 
 which, as always, are profits for the war industry, for the 
 capital system that tries to come out with the war from the crisis in 
 to which it is and in which the world drags, which at the same time seeks 
 transform it into a gigantic new phase of oppression of peoples 
 of which Palestine looks like the symbol.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  War 
 imperialist can only be stopped if the popular war advances ", 
 that is, the proletarian war, the war of the exploited, the war 
 of the oppressed, from Palestine to Latin America, from India 
 to Africa, North Africa and the importance of fighting 
 against the imperialist beast inside, in the belly of the beast e 
 of our country's beast, given that we are in Italy, which is the government 
 fascist, imperialist, racist, militarist, interventionist, a 
 side of Israel, but also against the military contingent who goes to 
 Red Sea and also in Ukraine, with which it establishes a “corridor 
 black ”of military support, political coverage, etc. etc.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  From that stage 
 We said we must give maximum continuity to this 
 manifestation, but, of course, a movement of this kind that 
 faces an objectively prolonged struggle - because it is a war 
 prolonged that which is consumed in the Gaza strip and in the others 
 fire -in fire in the world - that a solidarity is needed 
 prolonged, an organized solidarity. In this sense we have 
 said by the stage: "We form the Palestine committees everywhere", as it was 
 in the 70s season, and the function of the Vietnam Committee that 
 there were really many and the material strength that in large and in the 
 small towns joined the long -lasting people's war of the 
 Vietnamese people.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  In the same 
 time the acting internationalism becomes a force of this 
 Battle of the Palestinians alongside the Palestinians in extensive form: 
 from the Court of Justice of the Aja to the same occupied territories. 
 From the stage we said we are for an international delegation 
 who participates in all this, we are for a contingent 
 internationalist who goes to Rafah and in the territories busy to offer 
 solidarity, support, to create a further problem 
 to the Nazi -type Zionist aggression, the logic of the genocide, 
 to the logic of the deportation of an entire people. We are for one 
 international delegation formed by all those who 
 manifest and represent all and naturally guided and melted with 
 The solidarity of the Palestinians from Gaza to our cities. A 
 internationalist contingent.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  In the final intervention 
 We said: let's fight against our government, ours 
 Imperialism, it is our task. Solidarity is not enough with whom 
 struggle in the territories invaded by war and aggression e 
 From oppression, we must overturn our imperialism. AND 
 This requires that we concentrate the struggle to hunt the government 
 Melons who, like other governments, is more or less in the same 
 sphere of what is called "Atlanticism", imperialism, governments alongside Ukraine in the war as part of that 
 deployment that wants to make war on Russia, respond to 
 Russia who invades with the war and drag us into the gigantic outbreak 
 of world war, with the great contrast between the power inside 
 main imperialist, the United States, and the antagonist of these 
 last years represented by China.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  To overturn the 
 Government it is necessary that the contents and the unit built in the 
 event of Milan leads to the factories, in the places of 
 work, on the territory, lean on the streets and squares for 
 overturn our government.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  And finally another 
 What we said - and here we could do it because whoever spoke 
 For us he came from Taranto, from Puglia - the companion who has us 
 represented has appealed to make the G7 in Puglia is one 
 new great opportunity because the entire movement of solidarity with 
 Palestine unites all the reasons for the political opposition e 
 social against this government, against all governments, the 7 masters 
 of the world that also want to do the G7 in Puglia - as it was in 
 Other G7, just remember the G7 of Genoa - their base of unity 
 To build war plans even more, the oppression plans 
 of the peoples, the plans for the immediation of peoples, the plans for use 
 artificial intelligence for war purposes, plans for 
 transform all climatic, environmental events, all crises 
 crises, immigration, in a strenuous defense of a system 
 putrid and dying and oppose it with the violence of the armies, of 
 bombs, to the army of proletarians and oppressed peoples who in all 
 The forms, in large and small forms, opposes all this.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  All on the G7 in Puglia 
 To make evident that the world is divided into two hills: the 
 hill of imperialism, the hill of proletarians, peoples and 
 all those who do not accept the world who are building us and 
 preparing, the horrible future, and the will to put an end to this 
 horror.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The Milan event, but also our intervention in 
 This event, as well as trusting us that we can go up 
 This path, which "another world is possible", means that 
 Today another political and social organization is possible, and on 
 It is based our struggle and our rebellion.
