  Especially women came to the microphone and said, ik We had to leave our country from the wars you created, we have no safety in Europe, we have no safety of violence, we came every day we lived daily, I came when I was five years old, then my father was a reliable country, but today is a reliable country. I shout here, I don't have my safety, yes, because we know that no one has the right law in the male -dominated system, we scream on the streets. Today, a thousand people are here, we will be in thousands of squares from now on. We do not leave the streets empty against your racist fascist policy ”.
