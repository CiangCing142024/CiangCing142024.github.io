 The people and youth of the country are in turmoil! Across 
 Subsequent attack promoted by the government and overall the system, 
 Significant resistances are born. Youth is a cauldron that 
 boils and gives a big battle against the private bill on private 
 Universities, with mass assemblies, occupations and demonstrations. The 
 farmers have been massively out of the blocks, against anti -groomed policy 
  Government-EU that has ruined their lives.
 <b>
  Workers we have 
 need to unite our own voice with the rest of the struggling pieces 
 of the people and to organize our struggle for work and life with 
 Rights!

 THE 
  working class and employees in private and public sectors 
 suffocate under the weight of everyday life. Precision has 
 crush the popular households. Real wages have fallen 
 vertically and the month does not come out, at the same time that capital 
 Treasures at our expense. The government invites us to get used to the 
 poverty and poverty, supposedly because this is what the strengths require 
 economy, while giving tens of billions to buy and 
 F-35 equipment.

 The 
 supposed measures to deal with accuracy announced the 
  Government staff is a raw mockery! The increase in the bottom 
 salary promised by Mitsotakis, but also the false-fracture of the 
 three years, they will not give any breath to workers who 
 they are narrowing. Are communicative tricks that the government tries to 
  entertain their anger. Up to the crumbs of the various 
 Benefits/Pass cut and what is left is the battle for the 
 survival.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <b>
  The Middle Ages is what envisions the capital for the world of work.
 </b>
 Work all day long and up to old age as cynically describes 
 recent anti -labor law Georgiadis. Labor -in -law, in which the 
 workers will work until extermination, for a piece of bread. 
 Intensification and inhumane working conditions, with consumables 
 workers, where they will be killed or crumbled daily to 
 Employment is profitable. The search for cheap labor hands in 
 immigrant workers who are intended to work in terms 
 slave, shows the work landscape they want to shape for the 
 all the employees of the country. And at the same time criminalized the 
 trade unionism, unionists are being fired and prosecuted as provided by 
 Hatzidakis' law-to-be 
 He was trying to convince us PAME).
 <br/>
 <br/>
 And yet while workers face a nightmare and an even worse future,
 <b>
  trade union leadership take care to keep workers on the sidelines
 </b>
 . 
  And even at the time of the racing in progress 
 mobilizations of students and farmers, and requires maximum racing 
  Coalition! The inexplicable (and more employer than ever) leadership of GSEE 
  announces a strike in the ... distant future, April 17, giving 
 time to government to unfold the anti-labor-anti-Antilated policy 
 her. But PAME also did what they could to not meet 
 Workers-Agre-Neoa on a common front. So he announced a strike 
 So far away, for the end of February. And of course neither is it noticing to 
 Modify, to proclaim it now that "the cauldron is boiling". This 
 Attitude of trade union leadership is leading the labor movement 
 from defeat to defeat and cultivates frustration and defeat in the 
  employees.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <b>
  We will not stay on the sidelines! Will not 
 We accept yet another strike-in-two rifle. We give it from now on 
 Battle, on the side of the competitors-student-agrarian students!
 </b>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 To 
  We spoil their plans! We have to do what is going through today 
  our hand to unite our voice with the students and their 
 farmers. Their struggles are also our own struggles and have to 
 We support. And that is the best way to work for the 
 Success of the strike on February 28th.
 <b>
  There is no waiting attitude.
 </b>
 Employees need to take the case of the race in our own hands!
