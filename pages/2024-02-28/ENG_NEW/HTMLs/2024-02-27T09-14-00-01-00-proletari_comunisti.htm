    A 
 Country where the Police Manganella Students who manifest 
 democratically dissent and the government says "they did well", 
 It is a country in danger.
   </span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  <span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">
   <span>
    We had it 
 Already said that with the Caivano decree and the cd. New “Package 
 security ”, the repressive turning point was already underway, because when 
 A country deals with social issues such as issues of public order 
 It is never a good sign. And in fact, for ten years now, 
 never so many minors in prisons, in some institutes it is feared 
 even the juvenile overcrowding. The entrances to the IPM are 
 increasing and growth of attendance is given almost entirely from 
 girls and boys for which the precautionary measure was arranged 
 pursuant to the new "Caivano" legislation.
   </span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  <span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">
   <span>
    But 
 a country that falls into the punitive temptation towards those who commit a 
 crime in such a crucial phase of its growth path has 
 chosen to abound the boys and take the path of the 
 pure and simple repression.
   </span>

    As 
 Yesterday, very young students in Pisa manifest by asking for the “Cassate 
 the fire ”in Palestine and of
    <span>

   </span>
  </span>
 </p>

  <span>
   against they suffer a violent, 
 unjustified, illegitimate charge by the police who there 
 Manganella with unprecedented and anti -democratic fury, some handcuffed 
 face down or with a bloody face.
   <br/>
  </span>
 </span>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  <span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">
   <span>
    Not 
 It is an isolated case. The demonstrators under the Rai offices were also 
 attacked by the police. The anti-sung procession in Bologna, kicks and 
 Manganelli on the protesters.
   </span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  <span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">
   <span>
    The 
 tensions in the country are growing rapidly and just to season again 
 more the repressive dish, representatives of the government defend, 
 they justify and legitimize police behavior pointing out 
 Students as "disorder professionals".
   </span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  <span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">
   <span>
    In 
 reality these words only serve to discourage the square, a 
 repress dissent, to compress democracy and to justify the 
 violent arm of the state.
   </span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  <span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">
   <span>
    From 
 That "You've been you, with your stone" pronounced by the deputy chief 
 Lauro after the killing of Carlo Giuliani by the state 
 During the G8, to date it seems terribly not to have changed 
 Nothing.
   </span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  <span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">
   <span>
    That 
 which happened yesterday is an abuse that falls on demonstrators 
 very young in defense of the Palestinian people. Another 2001 is 
 unacceptable.
   </span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  <span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">
   <span>
    The 
 dissent is the essence of democracy while the batons, i 
 beating and repression are abuse of power and repression does not 
 It must become normal. The square does not stop!
