  Two years after the outbreak of the
  <i>
   guerra
  </i>
  <i>
   for Prosecutor
  </i>
  between Russian imperialism and US/born imperialism and 
 of the European Union, Ukraine continues to be the vehicle, the
  <i>
   pawn 
 interested
  </i>
  to the division of the booty that can come from the clash between the 
 Imperialist countries, in fact, which must give an outlet to the economic crisis 
 world through the conquest of the markets, to guarantee the continuation of 
 enormous profits necessary for the survival of the capitalist-imperialist bourgeois system.
  <o:p>
  </o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  <o:p>
  </o:p>
  On February 24, in fact, i 
 representatives of the various imperialist countries gathered once again in 
 Ukraine, with the Meloni warflower in the front row because currently at 
 Presidency of the G7 shift. The ceremonies for the two years of war have started 
 Yesterday at Antonov airport, where Meloni did not miss the opportunity to tell 
 Bales and propaganda on the "nation" ...
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  "The goal" of the initiative, he comments 
 An article of yesterday's manifesto, “while the third year of war begins, is 
 say aloud that
  <u>
   The allies do not abandon Ukraine
  </u>
  "." Given the 
 continuous complaints of Zelenskj. But since the aforementioned offensive of 
 Spring of the Nazi Zelenskj did not succeed, on the contrary, saw the advance of the 
 Russi, then "nobody is safer on the future of events". Well yes 
 they also extend the times for the adhesion of Ukraine to the EU, despite the 
 Promises: "Pacified Ukraine will be part of the EU" said the president 
 of the European Commission with the helmet von der Leyen. " When it will be part of the 
 EU exactly does not know, in the meantime you can continue to destroy, 
 In short, the war can continue on all the land by putting on the field 
 Other "aid": “On the 88 billion of EU financing paid so far, 28 are 
 military assistance states and 5 others are provided for the assistance fund 
 common, for the purchase of weapons and ammunition, in addition to the training of 60 thousand 
 Ukrainian soldiers. "
  <o:p>
  </o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  <o:p>
  </o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  The words used by the impassive 
 representatives of imperialism - against the background of thousands of deaths - 
 However, they remain vague on the direct explicit commitment regarding the war. 
 These bilateral agreements, as the Manifesto writes, "involve a" guarantee 
 security »", and what does it mean? It is “a commitment to intervene to 
 Support of Ukraine beyond what has been done so far? It's a 
 replacement of article 5 of NATO "which provides for the entry into the war if a 
 Is it attacked ally? But “the EU is well careful not to go beyond the line 
 Red that could drag the block into a state of "co-co-belligorate" ".
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Therefore, what they really consist of 
 These bilateral agreements - while pushing towards a generalized enlargement 
 of the war - that Meloni for Italy also, as they had before they did great 
 Brittany, Germany, France, Denmark and Canada, signed in the building 
 Mariinsky?
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  "The Italian agreement explained 
 Meloni, it concerns
  <b>
   Industrial cooperation
  </b>
  , the exchanges of the services of 
 intelligence on cyber attacks,
  <b>
   support for reforms
  </b>
  ,
  <b>
   humanitarian
  </b>
  ,
  <b>
   later the reconstruction. "
  </b>
  <o:p>
  </o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  And in the end he concludes with a sentence 
 Effect: "Italy provides" unpublished and strengthened collaboration in case 
 of future attack »." It is a phrase that does not mean anything, since 
 What was to be said on this occasion was said by any 
 representative of the imperialist bourgeoisie present, if not that
  <b>
   will increase 
 Aid in cash, in arms and in military training.
  </b>
