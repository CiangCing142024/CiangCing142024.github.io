  On "Defense Day" (formerly called session), it has always been the case that a potential conscript can be rejected on the basis of their BMI or height. The defense believes that these requirements are no longer 'time -consuming'.
 </p>
 <p class="has-text-align-justify">
  The head of military service and recruitment in the Ministry of Defense's Personnel Board, Jesper Lynge, says that the change is due to the large number of unsuitable:
 </p>

  <em>
   "At present, we have a little more than 50 percent of young people who show up for Defense Day, who are declared unsuitable, and we think that is a big number."
  </em>

  This new initiative comes in line with the already controversial initiative on doubling military service by that

  One who is clearly part of the general reactionary of the Danish bourgeois state. Both initiatives are angled from the defense and the Danish bourgeois media to be an initiative of progressive diversity. But people are not stupid.

  All indications are that Denmark, and the imperialist countries in Europe in general, are getting ready to initiate new aggression wars. Sweden's defense manager, Michael Bydén, even stated directly, just under a month ago that the Swedish people should prepare for war. Similar statements have come from the military of Denmark and Norway.
 </p>
 <p class="has-text-align-justify">
  Workers and progressive lots of all kinds must and must stand against the country's build -up, and oppose the imperialist initiative of a 'wider defense'. When imperialist mass murderers like Anders Fogh Rasmussen say that "the road to peace in Ukraine is through [imperial] war", it should ring alarm bells for any person who knows Fogh's bloody war in Iraq killing over half a million people.
