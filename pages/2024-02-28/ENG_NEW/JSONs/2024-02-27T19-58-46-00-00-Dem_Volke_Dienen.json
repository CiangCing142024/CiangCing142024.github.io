Brazilian military police reach back but have formed their own armed combat association. The goal of the large landowner association, which has given itself the right name \"zero invasions\", is against the agricultural revolution in Brazil and especially the country invasions of the poor farmers. Founder of the organization is the former arch -reactionary President of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro.\n </p>\n <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n  The democratic and revolutionary newspaper \"A Nova Democracia\" describes in an article that this organization is by no means a completely new thing, but has been acting since March last year and has set itself the goal of Brazil against poor farmers, indigenous peoples and To become active, which is equivalent to a declaration of war according to the newspaper. A qualitative leap is said to have been completed in the organization's actions. Since its foundation, the actions of the \"Null Invasion\" have been limited to attempts at intimidation and siege from fighting farmers and their country invasions.\n </p>\n <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n  However, on January 21 of this year, 200 large landowners and their mercenaries organized a military operation against the indigenous area of Caramuru-Catarina in which they entered the area in joint action and protection with the Brazilian military police to drive the indigenous population from their country. In this armed attack, the indigenous activist and farmer Nega Patax\u00f3 was shot by the son of a large landowner. The day before, the military police prepared this military operation by entering the area of the indigenous people, beating indigenous people and their cell phones could not take any shots of the following raid.\n </p>\n <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n  The article continues to report the \"zero invasion\" already very closely worked together with armed forces of the old Brazilian state in other states. Finally, the newspaper summarizes that the poor farmers, indigenous and quilombolas in the fight for their right to land do not remain many options than what the league of the poor farmers propagated last year: armed self -defense against the war of large landowners.\n </p>\n <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n  <img alt=\"gro\u00dfgrundbesitzer der null invasion1\" src=\"https://demvolkedienen.org/images/Brasilien/Artikelbilder_2024/gro\u00dfgrundbesitzer_der_null_invasion1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://demvolkedienen.org/images/Brasilien/Artikelbilder_2024/gro\u00dfgrundbesitzer_der_null_invasion1.jpg\"/>\n  <br/>\n  <em>\n   Large landowners of the \"zero invasions\" gather for the armed attack against indigenous people.\n  </em>\n  <a href=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/ma-comunidades-camponesas-realizarao-tribunal-popular-em-junco-do-maranhao/\">\n   <em>\n    <br/>\n   </em>\n   <br/>\n   The newspaper \"A Nova Democracia\" informs in another article that will take place on March 9th and 10th in the state of Maranh\u00e3o.\n  </a>\n  This folk tribunal will be composed of human rights defenders, activists and researchers and has set itself the goal of examining and condemning the crimes of the large landowners and the old Brazilian state of more than 10 farmers' communities in the Gurupi region on the border between the states of Para and Maranh\u00e3o. For this purpose, the affected farmers should report their reports on the numerous crimes against them directly in front of the folk tribunal. In addition, a group of lawyers should submit their report on the crimes committed against the farmers in the communities. Thereupon an inspection of the crime scenes should also be carried out.\n </p>\n <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n  On March 10th, each member of the assessment commission should then be seen, seen and heard and submitted his personal assessment from which a uniform report is then created with necessary recommendations. The folk tribunal will be organized in partnership with the committee of solidarity with the struggle for the country and the Union of the communities in combat.\n </p>\n <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n  <img alt=\"zusammenstellungbild ucl und solidarit\u00e4tskomitee1\" src=\"https://demvolkedienen.org/images/Brasilien/Artikelbilder_2024/zusammenstellungbild_ucl_und_solidarit\u00e4tskomitee1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://demvolkedienen.org/images/Brasilien/Artikelbilder_2024/zusammenstellungbild_ucl_und_solidarit\u00e4tskomitee1.jpg\"/>\n  <br/>\n  <em>\n   Past meetings of the Union of the municipalities in combat.\n  </em>\n  <br/>\n  <a href=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/am-apoiada-por-governo-justica-federal-aprova-exploracao-imperialista-de-potassio-em-terra-indigena/\">\n   <br/>\n   In the state of Amazon, the federal court \"Trf-1\" responsible for the region has given the company \"Pot\u00e1ssio do Brasil\" (in German: \"\" Potassium chloride from Brazil \"), contrary to the decision of the Amazon Regional Court, the license to reduce potassium.\n  </a>\n  Previously, due to struggles of indigenous and poor farmers, there had been a victory over the company when the state court of the state ordered a ban on the mining of potassium in the region.
