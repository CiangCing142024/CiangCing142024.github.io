But since the aforementioned offensive of \n Spring of the Nazi Zelenskj did not succeed, on the contrary, saw the advance of the \n Russi, then \"nobody is safer on the future of events\". Well yes \n they also extend the times for the adhesion of Ukraine to the EU, despite the \n Promises: \"Pacified Ukraine will be part of the EU\" said the president \n of the European Commission with the helmet von der Leyen. \" When it will be part of the \n EU exactly does not know, in the meantime you can continue to destroy, \n In short, the war can continue on all the land by putting on the field \n Other \"aid\": \u201cOn the 88 billion of EU financing paid so far, 28 are \n military assistance states and 5 others are provided for the assistance fund \n common, for the purchase of weapons and ammunition, in addition to the training of 60 thousand \n Ukrainian soldiers. \"\n  <o:p>\n  </o:p>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm;\">\n  <o:p>\n  </o:p>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm;\">\n  The words used by the impassive \n representatives of imperialism - against the background of thousands of deaths - \n However, they remain vague on the direct explicit commitment regarding the war. \n These bilateral agreements, as the Manifesto writes, \"involve a\" guarantee \n security \u00bb\", and what does it mean?
