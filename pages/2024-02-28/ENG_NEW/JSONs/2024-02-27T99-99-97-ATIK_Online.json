His party's name is Werte Union or Union of Values.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Just like Alexander Gauland of Alexander Gauland, who founded AFD to challenge the CDU, Maa\u00dfen's one -man show wants to challenge the Conservative CDU, Germany's traditional right.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Unlike eleven years of Neo-Nazi AFD, the newly established Union of Values is challenging Gauland's Neo-Nazi Afd.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Maa\u00dfen's new party CDU's fashion is operating under \u201cFreedom instead of Socialism\u201d. The party moves with paranoia with a McCarthy -style \u201cReds under the beds\u201d.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This phenomenon has been known since Hofstadter in 1964 in Harper\u2019s Magazine on political paranoia.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Strangely, Maa\u00dfen and a few followers gathered on a small boat on the Rhine near Remagen for the establishment of his party. This was a quite isolated place that was not allowed to enter journalists or people.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Maa\u00dfen's single-man show- with reactionaries close to fascism- wants to attract the far-right voters on the right of Merkel's and Merz's party CDU.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hans-Georg Maa\u00dfen was elected as the party president unanimously and unanimously, as expected from a carbon copy on the far-right of Germany.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In fact, Maa\u00dfen's real plan was to return to Bonn, the former German capital of Germany to establish its party. After all, this was the city where he was a law student and later in the German Ministry of Interior within the scope of the secret bribery fund of the former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, which was ruled by the CDU since 1991.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Kohl's ideological successor Angela Merkel, Maa\u00dfen, Germany's internal intelligence organization and official name of the Constitutional Conservation Department (BFV) brought the head of the institution.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In 2018, Maa\u00dfen was dismissed after doubting the presence of Neo-Nazi uprising in Chemnitz. It's not a coincidence, Chemnitz is also the hometown of Germany's worst neo-nazi killer team after World War II. Maa\u00dfen has a history of ignoring German Neo-Nazi terrorism.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Meanwhile, internal intelligence services are investigating the former boss as a suspicious person who may be linked to extreme right. Just a few weeks after its establishment, Maa\u00dfen's Union of Values began to establish the purpose of being established using online platforms to attack CDU and party leader Friedrich Merz. The main objectives of the Union of Values of both party and leader Maa\u00dfen.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Merz's \u201con the wrong way\u201d is mentioned in the shares of Facebook and X (Twitter). And he says that CDU has forgotten that he had already worked in the tradition of \u201cAdenauer and Kohl's CDU tradition, as it was once.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Union of Values explained that in order to camouflage its extreme rightism, it is \u201cofficial\u201d as \u201cfreedom, the superiority of law and the basic law of Germany's constitutional order\u201d. These are important for three reasons:\n </p>\n <p>\n  Democracy: The Union of Values must show that Germany is a democratic political party to Germany's internal intelligence, despite the defense of radical authoritarianism and the pursuit of military dictatorship.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Academics: The Union of Values must also act as a democratic party for innocent, pure and easy deceitable academics and academics. This is exactly why no negative report about the party is made in an academic journal. As in the AFD example, this will give good results; and finally:\n </p>\n <p>\n  Voters: The Union of Values should convince the voters- and all potential voters coming from other parties- from Germany's conservatives (eg CDU). This will be very useful, because most conservatives are not worried about democracy. If they think of power and how to get it, they include a Machtergreifung (seizing power).\n </p>\n <p>\n  The website of the Union of Values is structured to reflect the three basic points summarized above. Furthermore, Maa\u00dfen says, \u201cWe just want to go back to the future,\u201d he says.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Anyone who watches the classic film will understand that this is the password of going to a timely 30 years ago \u201d, even further before the lost war, a time when a single party is a nation of iron.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Maa\u00dfen also says that the future depends on values. Apparently, this means the recycling of the values that once made the \u201cOld Germany strong strong, that is, that makes the old CDU strong. However, considering the tendency to anti-democratic administration alone, this is a trick.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Maa\u00dfen's Party Plan does not aim to cope with the problems we face today and especially we will face tomorrow: an uninhabitable world, as the UN Guterres states, 6. Mass destruction, \u201cWe are still in a car that goes to the climate hell. \"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The plan of the Maa\u00dfen party is to opposite ideologically directed energy policies and to oppose \u201cclimate neutrality goals i\u00e7in for the year 2050. Instead, he argues that \u201cthe reconstruction of low -cost base load [coal] power plants and the potentially re -operation of the non -service nuclear facilities\u201d.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It is likely that such a plan will lead Germany to the abyss of Dante's global hell. It is unlikely that Germany will lead to any happy future.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Union of Values is the second new party founded by a well -known person this year. Sahara was the first of the Wagenknecht alliance. With Maa\u00dfen's Union of Values and the emergence of BSW, many people said, \"Is there a tendency towards the extreme parties?\" he wonders. \"Is this a repetition of the last days of the Weimar Republic?\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  This scenario resulted in the creation of Auschwitz, the most hellish place of our world, and more than 44,000 concentration camps.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Yes. You read the figure correctly. 44,000. Among these camps were death camps: \u201cThe first camp opened in December 1941 was Chelmno, where Jews and novels were killed by gas in mobile gas minibuses.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In 1942, the Nazis opened Belzec, Sobibor and Treblinka death centers. \u201d It can be thought that Maa\u00dfen's Union of Values is the closest party to the German National People's Party, the German National People's Party, and even helps Weimar's anti-democratic deutschnationale Volkspartei (DNVP), the German National People's Party.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In the 1930s, DNVP presented Volksgemeinschaft, who was dedicated to a powerful leader who aimed to eliminate all social classes in favor of Aryan Volk.\n </p>\n <p>\n  DNVP was one of the main authoritarian parties of Weimar Germany (1918-1933). In 1928, DNVP shifted to the right radical to the right after the press baron Alfred Hugenberg was controlled.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This was supported by a turbo charging by Ultra-Militarist Stahlhelm. In 1933, the DNVP was excited to join Hitler's coalition government.\n </p>\n <p>\n  With the Union of Values is a kind of \u201cnew DNVP\u201d on the horizon, Germany seems to have become a part of the world's right -wing tendency in recent years. This means that Germany's great parties have lost a significant amount of voters.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This magic number was accompanied by the disintegration of the political landscape of Germany, and the political field filled with smaller and generally quite marginal parties that draw the discontent and ignorant from the mainstream parties. Maa\u00dfen and its Union of Values are another indication that these small parties have multiplied but not individually strengthened.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Union of Values DNVP wants to participate in the state elections to be held in Th\u00fclingen, Saxony and Brandenburg in September this year. The registration periods for the European elections in June 2024 have already expired, so this time there is no such competition.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In the east, the party is likely to position the party on the right of the CDU, similar to the DNVP in the early 1930s. These 3 states will compete with AFD, BSW and many small local parties.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The most dangerous in terms of the division of right -wing votes parties such as anti -vaccine diebasis; The right -wing parties group under the flag of BFT, also known as Thuringen Free Voters; BDB/FW, a mixture of the BD alliance and free voters and others in Brandenburg, with its members in Germany.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Union of Values wants to show a smiling face as if it were CDU's willing partner. In the 1930s, Maa\u00dfen de Neo-Nazi AFD, who met Hitler's Nazi party, announced that he was \u201cready to meet\u201d with AFD.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Maa\u00dfen's plan is to break voters from both parties and fill the gap between the conservative CDU and the Neo-Nazi Afd.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Maa\u00dfen lives in a political hallucination. The cliff between the non-progressive CDU and outright Neo-Nazi AFD, which he thinks are separated from the path of conservative values, is not a cliff. It is more like a small crack, maybe a fault line. Maa\u00dfen tells the public that AFD is a bit too radical.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For strategic reasons, Maa\u00dfen continues to see both the CDU and AFD as potential partners that will strengthen its political position.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Union of Values aims to seize Germany's small bourgeoisie, conservatives, believers on the free market, national liberals, and even more ideological libertarians on the conservative side of Germany's classical social democrats (SPD). He also imagines that he can attract voters from the SPD's conservative wing, the Helmut Schmidt wing.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ten years ago, this segment received support with Thilo Sarrazin's right -wing propaganda, which implied the Popular theme of the West, a popular theme of German reactionary thought since Oswald Spenger.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Maa\u00dfen's same-poisonous companions, the former Vice-Admiral Alexander Mitsch, Kay-Achim Sch\u00f6nbach (German militarism is never far from the combination of the extreme right) and former CDU deputy and former electric technician Albert Weiler represents all these various stances.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The draft of the establishment program of the Union of Values includes expressions in a very similar language in Neo-Nazi AFD's program. This is not something new either. In the 1930s, the DNVP had a similar language to Hitler's Nazi party. Historically, most of them are not new.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Union of Values says, \u201cWe are in favor of the collapse of the party state and the expansion of popular sovereignty\u201d. It is in favor of the introduction of plebicitarian elements such as referendum. Similarly, we want to give the right to vote against the laws agreed by the Parliament, Af says AFD. The current parliamentary democracy system will be eliminated or restricted.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hans-Georg Maa\u00dfen, who moves from the same fascist game book with Trump, Putin and AFD, is the camp of Germany's progressive and environmentalists, despised and hated.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It positions as \u201cleft-green camp\u201d. During the DNVP (1930s), the imaginary enemy was KPD.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Today, this location is occupied by Germany's environmental party Greens (we can tolerate capitalism). The Greens are passionately hated for advocating critical thinking by the Union of Values of CDU, Maa\u00dfen's reactionary wing, and further by Neo-Nazi AFD, and implements real programs that will benefit the environment.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Right -wing populists always need an enemy where they can demonize and ultimately kill without any conscientious intervention. This is not even a new thing. Nazi Party member Carl Schmitt - NSDAP Mitgliedsnummer: 2,098,860 - Since they advocated the completely destruction of the enemy, all right -wing authoritarians have included this belief in their canons.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Meanwhile, authoritarian Hans-Georg Maa\u00dfen continues to be a very controversial person. Although Maa\u00dfen acted as a traditionalist and introduced himself as the protector of Adenauer and Kohl's CDU, he is not aware of neither in the 1950s nor in the 1980s (Kohl).\n </p>\n <p>\n  What makes Maa\u00dfen a dangerous reaction is this call to a nostalgic past that has never happened. He wants to return the clock a few decades, maybe before 1945.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A light of hope is that a party, which is often decided by a few hundred and white men to its establishment, cannot cope with the difficulties of the modern election market.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Who would want an old agent that really fell out of sight to take over anything? Especially someone who has a fashioned cold war ideology that wants to live in the past. Without Tiktok and Youtube? MY GOD!\n </p>\n <p>\n  Unfortunately, things that once had real nightmares in election campaigns are dressed as pastoral dreams of their once -glorious past, dressing new glittering costumes. Nihilist authoritarian parties can never create positive plans for the future.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As Sex Pistols declared: There is no future under fascist regimes. The Maa\u00dfen and the Union of Values promises \u201ca change of direction in almost all central policy areas ..\n </p>\n <p>\n  Behind this war, an authoritarian and harsh internal policy is hidden in a strict and reactionary social policy that makes little mercy on the weak. This is Hitler's \u201cVolksgemeinschaft 2.0 ..\n </p>\n <p>\n  Of course, in order to stay in the same line with his friends on the right, this includes a very restrictive migration policy that should not even have compassion for minors. AFD had actually argued that the refugee was shot at the borders of Germany.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Pressure will also be made for the assimilation of immigrants. Either they adapt to our Volksgemeinschaft or they go away. The bell that AFD stole is playing a very similar bell. It is also colored with strong positions against Islam, even with real hostility towards religion and followers.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Avandland evokes the images of Abendland, which should be defended against non -bee. Here, too, the Union of Values is once again close to AFD. Almost an old speech of the DNVP of the 1930s or Hitler's Nazi party can be taken and the word \u201cJewish\u201d can be changed with \u201cMuslim ..\n </p>\n <p>\n  The people around Maa\u00dfen- and Maa\u00dfen has no real problems with Neo-Nazi Afd. Rather, there is a so -called \u201cviolent criticism \u00f6z for all positions to the left of the socialist, communist and Maa\u00dfen called\u201c extreme leftist ..\n </p>\n <p>\n  Maa\u00dfen's election strategy is that if AFD approaches the majority of parliament in the upcoming Eastern state elections, Maa\u00dfen's Union of Values (if they manage to enter any state parliament) will help AfD to come to power.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Just as DNVP was once Hitler's volunteer executioners, today there will be voluntary executioners that will carry Neo-Nazi Afd to power.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There are signs that there is a political gap between the conservative CDU and the Neo-Nazi Afd. Maa\u00dfen's reactionary values union is watered in the hope that they can fill this gap.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In September this year, the state elections to be held in Thuringen, Saxony and Brandenburg will show whether Maa\u00dfen's affordable attempt to establish a third political party on the far right of Germany will be successful.\n </p>\n <p>\n </p>\n <p>\n  *Thomas Klikauer, who was born at the foot of the Frankenstein Castle, is the author of more than 950 publications, including a book on the Alternative F\u00fcr Deutschland.
