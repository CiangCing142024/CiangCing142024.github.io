Across \n Subsequent attack promoted by the government and overall the system, \n Significant resistances are born. Youth is a cauldron that \n boils and gives a big battle against the private bill on private \n Universities, with mass assemblies, occupations and demonstrations. The \n farmers have been massively out of the blocks, against anti -groomed policy \n  Government-EU that has ruined their lives.\n <b>\n  Workers we have \n need to unite our own voice with the rest of the struggling pieces \n of the people and to organize our struggle for work and life with \n Rights!\n </b>\n <br/>\n <p>\n </p>\n <div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n  <b>\n   <span style=\"font-size: medium;\">\n    The world of work to get in place\n   </span>\n  </b>\n </div>\n <b>\n  <div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n   <b>\n    <span style=\"font-size: medium;\">\n     Battle!

Precision has \n crush the popular households. Real wages have fallen \n vertically and the month does not come out, at the same time that capital \n Treasures at our expense. The government invites us to get used to the \n poverty and poverty, supposedly because this is what the strengths require \n economy, while giving tens of billions to buy and \n F-35 equipment.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <span>\n  <a name=\"more\">\n  </a>\n </span>\n The \n supposed measures to deal with accuracy announced the \n  Government staff is a raw mockery! The increase in the bottom \n salary promised by Mitsotakis, but also the false-fracture of the \n three years, they will not give any breath to workers who \n they are narrowing. Are communicative tricks that the government tries to \n  entertain their anger. Up to the crumbs of the various \n Benefits/Pass cut and what is left is the battle for the \n survival.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <b>\n  The Middle Ages is what envisions the capital for the world of work.\n </b>\n Work all day long and up to old age as cynically describes \n recent anti -labor law Georgiadis. Labor -in -law, in which the \n workers will work until extermination, for a piece of bread. \n Intensification and inhumane working conditions, with consumables \n workers, where they will be killed or crumbled daily to \n Employment is profitable. The search for cheap labor hands in \n immigrant workers who are intended to work in terms \n slave, shows the work landscape they want to shape for the \n all the employees of the country. And at the same time criminalized the \n trade unionism, unionists are being fired and prosecuted as provided by \n Hatzidakis' law-to-be \n He was trying to convince us PAME).\n <br/>\n <br/>\n And yet while workers face a nightmare and an even worse future,\n <b>\n  trade union leadership take care to keep workers on the sidelines\n </b>\n . \n  And even at the time of the racing in progress \n mobilizations of students and farmers, and requires maximum racing \n  Coalition! The inexplicable (and more employer than ever) leadership of GSEE \n  announces a strike in the ... distant future, April 17, giving \n time to government to unfold the anti-labor-anti-Antilated policy \n her. But PAME also did what they could to not meet \n Workers-Agre-Neoa on a common front. So he announced a strike \n So far away, for the end of February. And of course neither is it noticing to \n Modify, to proclaim it now that \"the cauldron is boiling\". This \n Attitude of trade union leadership is leading the labor movement \n from defeat to defeat and cultivates frustration and defeat in the \n  employees.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <b>\n  We will not stay on the sidelines!
