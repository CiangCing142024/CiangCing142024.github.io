In German, 20 municipal units ceased to work due to megaoperation, violating the right to learn 7.1 thousand students. At Mar\u00e9, where the Civil Police Special Resources Coordination (Core) undertakes the megaoperation, 24 schools that serve 8.1 thousand students closed. Finally, at Morro do Trem, 342 students from 2 schools could not study.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The right to work was also violated, as small slum merchants were prevented from opening their establishments.

In German, the Family Clinic (CF) Zilda Arns interrupted the operation, while in Penha the Aloysio Augusto Family Clinic suspended home visits.
