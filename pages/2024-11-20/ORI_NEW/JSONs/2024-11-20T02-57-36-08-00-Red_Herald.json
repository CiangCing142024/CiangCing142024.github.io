The majority in the Senate is with the Republicans! Concerns about \u201cTrump\u2019s instability\u201d have gripped liberals. While evaluating the anxiety about a future full of uncertainty, it would be useful to say something about Kamala Harris and the Democrats\u2019 defeat before analyzing Trump.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The first candidate of the Democrats was Biden. When Biden\u2019s senile status and his inability to persist against Trump pushed the Democrats to a new search, they found what they were looking for right next to him. Vice President Harris! Why not? The vice presidency had already given Harris a recognized qualification for the presidency. The Democrats first tried to do the job with a senile person and then with someone from the administration who was responsible for the economic scenario that caused the reaction of the masses. And it happened. Trump became president again. It will be remembered that the new president did not accept the results of the previous election and was held responsible for the storming of the Congress building.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So how did Trump become president? Why did the American people elect an \u201cunpredictable, unstable person\u201d as president?\n </p>\n <p>\n  First of all, the people of the USA did not make a free choice. In this advanced country of bourgeois democracy, the people had to choose one of the guys who were put before them / determined to govern them. The values represented by Trump could have been turned into an advantage for the \u201cDemocrats\u201d in the election, but it was not. Harris was well aware that she was shouldering the burden/crime/sins not only of Biden, from whom she took the flag, but also a wing of the ruling classes of the US politics. Harris is not a bigoted follower who blindly follows the Biden line; she may have unique aspects, personal ambitions or different attitudes towards tolerable policies. But there is no doubt that on fundamental issues, she is a politician who acts with the urge to protect and defend the interests of the class she speaks for.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The abortion rights debate was unique in this respect. Harris\u2019 stance on this issue was not sufficient. Trump\u2019s statement closing the issue weakened the Democrats\u2019 hand. Trump said that no general law would be passed banning abortion rights and that the issue would be left to the states, and thus ended the debate.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Harris\u2019 weak point was precisely that she was not only a follower of current policy but also an executor. Her admission \u201cwhat can I say, I can\u2019t think of anything\u201d in a TV program she attended, in order to dispel expectations that she would pursue a different policy from Biden, is noteworthy. This statement was interpreted as a declaration of the continuity of policies that had caused public outrage. And it was an accurate comment. In short, she could not convince voters that she would pursue a different policy, she did not have a different policy preference.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The US elections provided important data that things are not going well in the heart of imperialism. Republicans had to face an unstable entertainer. Times of crisis give life to exactly such characters. It is possible to attribute Trump\u2019s unstable behavior to the crisis of the US economy and democracy.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Trump appeared before the people saying different things than what was already there. He moved forward by targeting the economic scenario, the decline in purchasing power, and inflation. He compared the economic situation of the masses with a few years ago and asked, \u201cAre you better now?\u201d He did not refrain from targeting irregular immigrants; moreover, with a facial expression that would make \u00dcmit \u00d6zda\u011f jealous, he promised to deport all irregular immigrants. Although he did not say anything about how he would do this, he pointed to immigrants as the target of the discontent that was forming in the masses. Trump not only voiced the expectations and demands of the most reactionary wing of the Republicans, but also manipulated the discontent in the masses. He put both poverty and destruction on the shoulders of immigrants. He said nothing about the policies of US imperialism that led to irregular immigration.\n </p>\n <p>\n  While the billions of dollars given to the Ukraine war caused discontent among large segments of the population affected by the economic crisis in the US, the Democrats were determined to continue the war, and moreover, Harris had reinforced her determination to fight with her admiration for Zelensky. Trump, on the other hand, said that he would end the war within 24 hours by saying \u201cAmerica First\u201d. He did not explain how he would do this. He could share the economic burden of the war with the EU countries. In fact, steps in this direction had been taken by the Democrats and even a decision had been made. So how will Trump direct the Ukraine war? It is certain that he will not be able to defeat Russia overnight, and at the same time, he cannot ignore the demands of German imperialism, the engine of the EU. If we note that regional developments have progressed to a much more tense stage than Trump\u2019s first term, it is clear that US imperialism does not have the luxury of staying in the background in the war for hegemony. Forcing Ukraine to make peace is one option. However, it is also necessary to convince EU imperialism of this. Zelensky? He is nothing without the corpses of the Ukrainians!\n </p>\n <p>\n  The policy of support for Israel is an undisputed issue for both Democrats and Republicans. Both wings have expressed their determination to continue support for Israel. The Democratic presidential candidate from the \u201cothers\u201d had no problem in referring to the war Israel is waging in Palestine as Israel\u2019s right to defend itself. No one doubts the Republicans\u2019 support for Israel. In fact, Trump\u2019s victory will push regional countries, especially Iran, to be more careful in their attacks on Israel. In general, war is on the agenda of imperialism as a tendency. The polarization between imperialists is shaped through regional wars. Trump\u2019s description of himself as a \u201cpeace ambassador\u201d is contrary to both his character, the values he defends, and the tendency of capital. In other words, a terrible tirade from a bad, rude entertainer!\n </p>\n <p>\n  Trump has especially received the support of Silicon Valley. Trump has to take steps in line with the expectations of this capitalists segment. Emphases that he will increase customs duties were among the prominent headlines of his election campaign. Promises to impose 20 percent tax on European countries and 60 percent tax on China are in line with Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d. While increasing customs duties will bring gains to Silicon Valley, it will come back as a cost increase to the public. Moreover, we can also note that it will cause tension in relations with its ally Germany. The concern about a \u201cfuture full of uncertainties\u201d is justified based on the nature of the imperialist system. In today\u2019s political scene, where characters like Trump are running rampant, the picture is even more frightening. However, the determining factor is not the characters of individuals but the interests of capital. The characters of individuals may very well be in line with the famous expression \u201cZeitgeist\u201d. Populism needs exactly such characters and presents them to the public as an option by blessing them with their slobbery mouths and lips full of profanity. By the way, the boots of fascism may be marching rampant in Trump\u2019s mind; moreover, he often expresses his fascist mentality by his tongue. We are talking about someone who has reinforced this aspect with his admiration for Hitler. However, Trump\u2019s election does not mean that American democracy will prefer fascism. We can say that the fascist wing of the Republicans will act more boldly in the political arena in the coming period; but it is not possible for us to talk about the conditions that will replace American democracy with fascism. What we insistently emphasize is that fascism is not a personal choice, but an administrative phenomenon, and it can be implemented as a class choice based on this very reality.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Trump jumped to his feet among his guards during the assassination attempt and gave a look of determination. In reference to that incident, he did not refrain from blessing himself by saying, \u201cGod saved my life for a reason\u201d in his election victory speech. It will be remembered that Erdo\u011fan also said, \u201cGod\u2019s grace\u201d for July 15. The same chant in different mouths! Because the story is the same!\n </p>\n</div>", "pdf_content": "", "pdf_links": [], "source": "https://redherald.org/2024/11/19/yeni-demokrasi-on-the-us-elections/", "type": "article", "title": "Yeni Demokrasi on the US elections \u2013 The Red Herald", "description": "Following Trump\u2019s victory in the presidential election, concerns about the future of the United States and of the world are widespread.", "modified time": "2024-11-19T18:27:57+00:00", "author": ["F.W."], "categories": ["Featured", "The Americas"], "tags": ["Elections", "Yankee imperialism"], "sections": ["Featured", "The Americas", "Elections", "Yankee imperialism", "English", "pll_673cd86d9c80c"], "source_name": "Red Herald"}
