   The nature and policies of NDA alliance
   <span style="">
    - Our stand
   </span>
  </b>
 </p>
 <p>
  Since no party including BJP gained majority, it became the largest
party but had to form a coalition government with its NDA allies. However
the NDA government and the RSS-BJP are yet the main danger to the
country. Imperialists welcomed the election of Modi as the Prime Minister
in the NDA government. There will not be any major change in its policies in
the interests of the imperialists, comprador bureaucratic bourgeoisie and
feudal landlords and in the brutal attacks on the people of the oppressed
classes, sections and nationalities and on their revolutionary, democratic
voices.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was large speculation about big majority for BJP that created
a false boom in Delhi and Mumbai stock exchanges. Thirty lakh crores
rupees of ordinary investors were looted. Even before the government was
formed there was the NEET paper leak, the scam of grace marks, the toll tax
was very high, there were terrorist accusations against democratic voices
such as writer Arundhati Roy and whereas Medha Patkar was awarded
prison sentence for five months. The unceasing fire in Manipur and the
killing of youth aspiring freedom in the name of terrorists in Jammu and
Kashmir shall rise in the rule of the coalition government. The past six
months have been witnessing the murders of revolutionaries and
revolutionary people in scores of numbers in each operation in Operation
Kagaar by the Indian Army and Air force in the veil of Para-military, the
Para-military, and the Special and Commando forces of the states in the
areas of revolutionary movement. The invitation to Modi to attend G7 meet
in Italy with the confidence that he would win shows that they need Modi
and that Modi’s rule is in their interests. In the name of 'Indianising' the
Indian Penal Code, Criminal Procedure Code and the Evidence Act that have
been being implemented since the British rule, changed as Bharathiya
Nyaya Samhita, Bharathiya Nagarik Suraksha Samhita and Bharathiya
Sakshya Adhiniyam which are more draconian than during the time ofthe
8
colonialists. In the name of speedy justice this will leads to give
indiscriminate punishments on the big scale and the State will become
police state. Allies did not expressed even minimum objection that shows
how brutal and bureaucratic the coalition government is going to be.
 </p>
 <p>
  In order to overcome the world economic crisis, the imperialists
need resources, cheap labor power and a broad market in the backward
countries. They need evil rulers like Modi in those countries. They need
them to adopt policies in the interests of the imperialists, comprador
bureaucratic bourgeoisie and feudal landlords and implement those
aggressively in fascist methods. It is beyond doubt that NDA rule will
definitely carry them through. All the Parliamentary opposition parties
including Congress shall nominally oppose these and try to deceive the
people to the best of their strength. These show superficial protest to the
massacres of the tribal people, especially in Dandakaranya fighting for jaljungle-zameen-ijjat-adhikar. This is the nature of the comprador ruling class
parties that act differently while in power. Therefore, we need to bring the
people out of the illusions on these parties. We need to understand that
any bourgeois party is the same and works in the interests of the
imperialists.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   <span style="">
    Intensifying contradictions among the ruling cliques
   </span>
  </b>
 </p>
 <p>
  Like it did in the past ten years, the BJP under the leadership of
Modi is going to conspire to eat away not only the opposition parties but
also the NDA allies. There are such experiences in the past. Internal strife
came to fore at the time of oath taking ceremony. Key Minister Posts were
taken by BJP and unimportant ones were given to the allies. It was a fact
that Modi led the 70 ministers from his office in the past ten years like a
dictator. Now whoever might be the Minister of whatever department and
from whichever party, Modi, his clique and the advisers and bureaucrats
will lead. There will be no democracy at least for even in namesake. In this
background, contradictions shall increase among the ruling classes. Internal
strife shall intensify among the NDA allies. Nitish and Chandrababu Naidu
are representatives of the comprador bureaucratic bourgeoisie and feudal
classes. They are loyal servants of the imperialists. But they do not have a
9
religious agenda like the BJP. However, since NDA is an opportunistic
alliance, they would definitely look for an alternative if anything goes
against their interests. So, due to the big brother attitude and hegemony of
BJP, contradictions shall gradually intensify not only in the central
government but also in the NDA allies and the parties. This will lead to
political crisis. As a result of all these, all the major contradictions in the
country shall intensify.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the background of imperialist crisis Brahmanic Hindutva Fascism
is strengthening. The crisis is exposing the destructive nature of imperialism.
People’s struggles are arising against imperialist exploitation and oppression
all over the world. The ruling classes of the country clearly understood from
the elections that any anti-people policies to exploit the country would be
facing strong resistance from the people. Even though the ruling classes of
the country are the main enemies of the people, the majority Hindus are
being instigated against the minority Muslims, Christians, North East
nationalities, the Dalit and tribal people like enemies. There are attacks on
minorities. In the background of the election to the Loksabha we cannot
imagine that such attacks will stop in the rule of NDA. The ruling classes
unleash intense repression on one hand and on the other, try to divert the
struggles of the oppressed people against exploitation and oppression and
for their rights from going towards revolutionary violence. The conditions
demand that these forces must fight more and unitedly.
 </p>
 <p>
  The BJP that won for the third time will work in the direction of
establishing Hindu state by 2047. It shall make preparations to come to
power in the election in 2029 and also in the states from now itself. The
imperialist globalization policies and Brahmanic Hindutva Fascist policies of
the government are against the interests of the exploited people, sections
and nationalities and the country. So, the struggles of the broad people
against these policies shall widen and intensify. BJP wants an opposition
free country and so the opposition parties will have to face the attempts to
break their unity. It will affect the nominal federal nature of the country. So
the opposition parties and the state governments will need to fight against
this. Organizations, unions, parties, intellectuals and pro-people's media
10
that criticize, question and fight BJP will be targeted more. In order to
establish Brahmanic Hindutva state it will intensify elimination of
revolutionary movement and the Northeast and Kashmir nationality
struggles and suppression of democratic movements. The broad masses and
the democratic, revolutionary forces need to fight against this
Constitutional autocracy. Minorities, secular and democratic forces need to
fight against the majoritarian state. Basing on this political situation, we
must adopt tactics to isolate the Brahmanic Hindutva Fascism that is the
main enemy and overcome the temporary setback in the revolutionary
movement and advance it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Our Party and Mass Organisations must always expose the class
nature of Modi government constituted of Brahmanic Hindutva ideology. In
the semi-colonial, semi-feudal India, workers, peasants, petty and middle
bourgeoisie, the oppressed classes and sections and nationalities can solve
their problems and ultimately achieve victory only through struggle with
firm determination in the leadership of the proletariat. The proletarian
party can advance its objective only through planned and regular practice. It
needs time, plan and patient efforts among the people. That is the reason
the great Marxist teachers spoke about active party leadership for class line,
mass line, people’s army, PPW and. united front through collective
knowledge of the people.
 </p>
 <p>
  It is a big challenge for the revolutionary, democratic forces and the
oppressed people of the country to fight Brahmanic Hindutva Fascism that
is rising with the objective of establishing ‘Hindu fascist state’. At the same
time it is a great opportunity to build a united strong struggle. Therefore,
there is a strong need to enlighten the masses of the country and build class
struggles and broad people’s movements in ideological, theoretical,
economic, political, social, cultural and all spheres in order to militantly
resist the policies unleashed by Brahmanic Hindutva fascism and fascist
Modi government in favor of imperialists and comprador ruling classes and
against the country and the broad masses. The various people’s struggles
must be developed into organized, broad, militant political struggles. These
must be interlinked with armed struggle in a proper manner. For the
11
purpose we must develop our efficiency in a big way and take up collective
practice utilizing the organized force of the PARTY, PLGA and organs of the
people.
 </p>
 <p>
  RSS considers communists as its deadly enemies since the beginning.
Therefore, it has been constantly intensifying fascist elimination offensives
on the revolutionaries and the people in the guidance of the LIC strategy
and tactics formulated by the US imperialists. As a part of it, it is deploying
lakhs of government forces in the areas of revolutionary movement all over
the country and is implementing corporatization-militarization. It has been
already unleashing war of elimination in the name of reactionary SurajkundOperation ‘Kagaar’, 'Clean' on the just revolutionary movement, the Maoist
party, PLGA organs of revolutionary people’s power, Mass Organizations in
the leadership of Unified Commands together with the state governments.
It is holding armed military operations through the Indian Army, the several
Para-military (CRPF, BSF, ITBP, SSB, CISF, NSG) forces, the murderous armed
and Commando (Greyhounds, Hawk, SOG, STF, Thunderbolt, Jaguar, C-60),
DRG, DVF, Bastar Fighters, Danteswari fighters and other such) forces of the
states with 81 mm rockets and various kinds of artillery, shells, drone
bombs, Air force helicopters and other such modern weaapons and even
light tanks. It is unleashing mass pogroms and creating terror among the
people. It is holding large scale psychological operations through the
reactionary, monopoly propaganda and mass communication media. It
alleges that terrorists and Maoists infiltrated into the movement wherever
one comes forth in the country and brands the demands criminal.
 </p>
 <p>
  Generally we might not enough perform some times in fighting back
each and every operation and campaign of the enemy in high and intense
levels and there might be mistakes and confusion in the beginning which
leads to more losses and difficulties. We are facing more losses in resisting
Operation ‘Kagaar’, 'Clean' due to low preparation for war, low
preparedness and confusions. Hence, we are making valuable sacrifices.
Subjective effort is important to see that the enemy’s objective is not
fulfilled in the ongoing war of elimination. As a part of it we must make
active self-defense war-guerrilla war and continue warr for a long time. We
12
must creatively apply the strategy-tactics of PPW with the fundamental
rules of guerrilla war – we retreat when the enemy advances; we harass
him when he rests; we attack when tired; we chase in retreat; secrecy,
speed, change of place – and other such things and develop guerrilla war
basing on the developing mass base. We must get accustomed to the
intense level war and withstand courageously. We must totally utilize the
weaknesses of the enemy, gradually lessen our losses and thus develop the
rate of our daily victories. Our propaganda teams, mass work
units/teams/organizers, guerrilla units must work in broad areas. These
must implement the political line, program and the policies of the party. It
means these have to fight for the multipronged interests of the entire
oppressed people. There will be favorable and unfavorable aspects in PPW.
We must utilize the favorable aspects, overcome the unfavorable aspects
and create the opportunities to go forth.

 <p>
  As the movement develops, as the class consciousness of the people rises, as the economic and political crises intensify, as the social
conditions change, we must politically mobilize and organize the people in
the struggles of resistance that arise from the enemy’s encirclementelimination war in many more varied self-defense-offense methods, in class
struggles, political struggles and people’s resistance struggles. This gives
birth to continuous new forms of struggle and organization in training the
new forces politically and theoretically. There must be changes in
functioning, work style, mass work, military work, guerrilla war and
discipline as per these new conditions. Changes will definitely come if we
make conscious effort. In the process of the movement, we must realize
new forms of struggle and organization that arise from the people and the
struggling forces, sharpen and generalize them, give a clear expression and
hand them over to the people. It is the main task of the party leadership to
see that they utilize these consciously and achieve better results. The
people’s struggle and People’s War going on in the present new conditions
of Operation Kagaar demand that all levels of leadership must pay attention
from the top to the bottom.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Let us intensify-widen class struggles with the following program
across the country in view of the above conditions post-election–
  </b>
 </p>
 <p>
  • Let us militantly resist the pro-imperialist, pro-comprador
bureaucratic bourgeois, pro-big feudal class policies of the fascist
Modi government. Let us mobilize the oppressed masses of large
forest, plain and urban areas into broad struggles for daily, basic
problems, on environment problem, against the draconian antipeople Acts and against corporatization-militarization. Let us
intensify-widen class struggle.
 </p>
 <p>
  • Let us constantly enlighten the people about the danger of
Brahmanic Hindutva fascist RSS-BJP in the leadership of Modi to the
country and the people. Let us build and make actively work the
various forms of anti-Brahmanic Hindutva fascist United Front at
various places with concrete program on a broad basis so as to
mobilize the broad masses against the outdated diehard Hindutva
ideology and isolate the fascist forces.
 </p>
 <p>
  Let us build militant
movements against the instigation on Dalit people, women,
religious minorities, tribal people by the majoritarian Hindutva
religious and casteist hatred, the obscene accusations, attacks and
mob lynching in the name of Cow slaughter, Love jihad, trolling, CAA
and new criminal laws. We must have the initiative to organize the
rising resistance to Brahmanic Hindutva Fascism among the religious
minorities, especially the Muslim people.
 </p>
 <p>
  • We must politically prepare the Party, PLGA, organs of revolutionary people and the people in our areas of work and make efforts to fight
back the war of elimination – Operation Kagaar on the people. We
must enlighten them about the intensity of enemy’s fascist attack,
its cruel nature and the need to make enormous sacrifices in the
process of fighting it back. We must protect the organs of the Party,
PLGA, and people including the leadership. We must build broad
United Front with all the forces against the massacres and state
violence on the people and the revolutionary movement and build
people’s resistance struggles. We must make continuous efforts to
14
develop mass base and subjective forces and take up guerrilla war
with initiative and actively to the best of our strength basing on it.
 </p>
 <p>
  • Apart from the daily problems we must organize the peasantry on
main demands – land to the tiller; all powers to Revolutionary
Peasant Committees/Agricultural labor Organizations, Revolutionary
People’s Committees; nationalize the agriculture farms and
plantations of the imperialist Multi-National Companies, capitalist
landlords, comprador bureaucratic capitalists and government; fight
for jal-jungle-zameen-ijjat-adhikar, mobilize the peasantry of not
only the areas of the movement but the entire country on a broad
basis and build a strong peasant movement. We must intensify
agrarian revolutionary struggle. We must mobilize the entire
democratic, pro-people forces in support of the farmers’ agitations.
We must build and intensify united struggles.
 </p>
 <p>
  • We must organize the workers against the brutal Acts being
indiscriminately used against the working class, against the violation
of their rights, for improvement of work conditions, for hike in real
wages and other such life and death problems and build a strong
and militant working-class movement.
• We must take up the program to mobilize the unemployed youth
against the problem of unemployment that is becoming a big giant
daily.
 </p>
 <p>
  • We must organize students-youth and teachers against the
corporatization-saffronisation of education.
• We must organize women’s movements on a broad basis against the
patriarchal exploitation and suppression on women, against sexual
atrocities, all kinds of violence, love jihad murders for prestige and
distorted feudal-imperialist vicious culture. We must build a strong
woman’s movement all over the country.
 </p>
 <p>
  • We must build a strong countrywide movement against the rising
Brahmanic Hindutva Fascist forces on the Dalit people and against
the caste exploitation and attacks of the oppressor castes. We must
mobilize advanced forces of the entirre castes in these struggles.
15
 </p>
 <p>
  • We must organize tribal, peasant and urban poor people on the
problem of displacement and build militant countrywide struggles
against the domestic, foreign corporate companies and the central
and the state governments.
 </p>
 <p>
  • We must unite with the people of various nationalities and
indigenous people fighting with demands for right to selfdetermination including right to secession in Kashmir and North
Eastern states and with the demands for special states and
autonomy. We must build solidarity movements, work together with
them. We must lend leadership to the nationality liberation
movements.
 </p>
 <p>
  • We must take the initiative to utilize the contradictions among the
ruling clique/parties in the coalition government without absolute
majority for any party and those between the ruling and opposition
parties. In view of our experiences in the activities of United Front,
we must adopt tactics so as to attract the oppressed people behind
the ruling parties towards us. We must remember the theoretical,
political and organizational level of the entire party in doing this. We
must work with Maoist style, stand on our own legs and enhance
our organized strength.
 </p>
 <p>
  • The Modi government is making a war on the people of the country
in the name of ultimate war on the Maoists through Operation
Kagaar/Clean. In this condition of war, we must learn to continue
mass work and military work without losing initiative. We must be
accustomed to new conditions and gain command on those.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   <span style="">
    Comrades,
   </span>
  </b>
 </p>
 <p>
  We gained valuable experiences in the past five and a half decades,
especially in the past four decades in various times in the leadership of the
party all over the country and in the areas of the movement in anti-feudal,
anti-imperialist class struggles with agrarian revolution as the axle,
developing guerrilla war. We have been fighting back and resisting the
unceasing offensive plans and campaigns of the Indian exploitive ruling
classes on the party and the revolutionary movement. We must now
develop the tactics according to these experiences applying to the present
condition. We must properly utilize politically the situation developing
favorable for revolution at the international plane and domestically. We
must build United Fronts against the exploitation of domestic and foreign
corporate companies and against feudal exploitation and oppression in the
urban, plain and forest areas of our work, strengthen and gradually expand
them. We must develop broad people’s struggles and class struggles in its
leadership. We must properly utilize militarily the geographical favorable
aspects and the weaknesses of the enemy in guerrilla areas. We must take
up active war of self-defense. Therefore we must constantly explore our
strength to the core and develop mass base, subjective forces and sources
for war. The leadership at all levels from the top to the bottom must
specially concentrate on this.
 </p>
 <p>
  We can advance by overcoming the present utmost critical situation
in the countrywide revolutionary movement only by implementing the
above mentioned program. Revolutionary, progressive, democratic and secular forces shall gradually develop. They shall ultimately bring down
exploiters, counter revolutionaries and reactionaries. This is the rule of
social development. In order to make true the rule, let us mobilize the
broad masses against the main danger of the country and the people from
the NDA government in the leadership of Brahmanic Hindutva Fascist Modi
and make daring efforts to fail the counter revolutionary ‘Kagaar’ on the
revolutionary movement, on the oppressed people, democratic, progressive
and secular forces of the country. Let us build people’s movements all over
the country at various places against the anti-people policies of fascist Modi
and develop those into broad movements with coordination. Let us step
forward towards rooting out Brahmanic Hindutva Fascism, all kinds of
reactionary, fascist counter revolutionary forces, imperialists, comprador
ruling classes in the path of Protracted People’s War with the objective to
establish a genuine democratic federal republic and ultimately accomplish
Socialism-Communism. People shall gain the ultimate victory.
