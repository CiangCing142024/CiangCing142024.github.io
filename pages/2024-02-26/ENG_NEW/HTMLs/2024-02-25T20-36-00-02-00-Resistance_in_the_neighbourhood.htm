  A meeting on the persecution industry set up against struggling teachers, which had been invited to the initiative of the overturn resistance unit was held on Thursday 22/2 on Thursday 22/2.
 </p>
 <p>
  Representatives attended the meeting:
  <b>
   The Municipal Schedule "Obligious Korydallos", the Political Organization of Red Thread, the Attica Book - Digital Media Association (which stated that it would talk to the club), Piraeus Popular Resistance, Piraeus Resistance, Racing III Western Intervention the class course and the racing moves of AEI-TE.
  </b>
 </p>
 <p>
  All attendees agreed that the issue of teachers' persecution for trade union and political action is very serious and linked to the general direction of terrorism and repression of militants, unions and movements.
 </p>
 <p>
  They have argued that the issue is not only about teachers but should be opened and linked to other affected and hit pieces (PENEN, dismissal of administration, students, etc.) in a logic of gaining wider characteristics. That must be answered in terms of mass movement and mobilization, with the aim of taking back all the persecutions.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was agreed to take place an afternoon demonstration in Piraeus - which has been the focus of persecution lately - in March (12/3, 14/3, 21/3), with its propaganda in the premises (schools, unions, neighborhoods etc) to be massive. To come out on the issue.
 </p>
 <p>
  In this direction and to expand the initiative and by other forces it was decided to hold a new immediately meeting on Tuesday 27/3 at 19:00 at the ELME Piraeus offices that would end up with all this. After all, there were many colleges that had declared a willingness to participate and contribution and failed to attend.
 </p>
 <p>
  As part of this initiative, several suggestions/ideas have fallen on the table such as: creating a fixed campaign on the issue that will be linked and acting together with other such moves, the event with the contribution of lawyers, trade unions and persecuted The logic of opening the issue, the connection of the movement with other corresponding initiatives taken in Thessaloniki and the coordination of steps with corresponding union initiatives, if any, to submit resolutions to the general assemblies of the student associations, as well as the address of the parents.
 </p>
 <p>
  The discussion ended with a commitment by the participants to fight for this initiative, to help embrace another world as well.
