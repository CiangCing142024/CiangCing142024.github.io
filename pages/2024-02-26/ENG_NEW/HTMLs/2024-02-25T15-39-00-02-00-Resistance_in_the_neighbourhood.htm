  The class march denounces the attempt to terrorize employees at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens (EKPA) by calling to the SAD of all members of the Board of Directors of the Association of Administrative Personnel of the NCA, the Bureau of the General Assembly of 7 of the Central Council of the Federation of Administrative Higher Education (SPETE) and employees at the NCSR, of which one (contractor, gar) is also threatened with dismissal.
 </p>
 <p>
  The EKPA Administrative Personnel Association at its General Assembly of 7 February made a decision to block the building that houses the key (Network Operation and Management Center) on 12/2 with the aim of blocking the tele-examinations. This mobilization aimed to support the student struggle against the establishment of private universities in the country.
 </p>
 <p>
  Indeed, the employees of the NCSR, jointly with the EIB and EDIP associations and the student associations, claimed and managed to suspend the operation of the network for about 75 minutes, resulting in the cancellation of the scheduled exams at that time. This became known outside the EKPA, took dimensions on social networks and nationwide television channels as a victory for workers, thereby annoying and provoking reactions: on the one hand the self -proclaimed prosecutor's intervention, on the other hand the folding of the Rector's Authorities. , who have suspended a contractor colleague and a member of the Central Council of PDPE and practically dismissed, after approaching the termination of his contract, with the risk of not being renewed. At the same time, they invited the members of the Board of Directors of the Association and the Bureau of the General Assembly that made the decision to mobilize.
 </p>
 <p>
  The persecutions of colleagues/equals for their trade union action, in support of the implementation of the decision of the General Assembly of their Association, are in full correspondence with the anti-labor-anti-representative laws of Hatzidakis and Georgiadis and the suppression of the Government. To be able to pass the bill on the establishment of private universities. From the calls throughout Greece, the Director (R) occupied by schools in police departments and the persecution of teachers, to the invasion of MAT in schools and schools under occupation, to the tears, the wood, the arrests on the marches, the government is fortified Behind terrorism and repression to continue its overall anti -populist policy.

  From the collapse of infrastructure and the consequent loss of life and destruction of property (fires in Eye and Euboea, train to Tempi, floods in Thessaly and how many more) to precision and austerity to the point where we deprive basic goods and electricity. From the market for the expensive war weapon and the country's absolute attachment to the US military requirements to complete submission to the EU's orders for the country's economy. From the destruction of public hospitals and free care-responsibility to hunger wages and the attack on any labor rights still. From the evaluation of schools and teachers to the abolition of free higher education, the bourgeoisie with an expression of its respective government is trying to "end" with the rights of this people.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the people's right to education, as well as their ability to strive and claim, are unobtrusive terms of life. That is why any mobilization "annoys" any struggle that unravels the true intentions of the government and any successful movement that breaks its omnipotence. In this context, the persecution of colleagues/equals in the NCSR are also included and in this context we declare our solidarity with our full support.
