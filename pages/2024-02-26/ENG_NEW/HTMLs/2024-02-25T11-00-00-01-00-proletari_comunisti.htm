 The militarization of all the imperialist countries of the world 
 continues to great steps. At the head of everything there are the United States that already 
 officially spend about $ 1000 billion a year (and these are the 
 official data!) And that continue to send weapons and money to the state 
 Nazisionist of Israel ... and in the same wake the collected imperialist countries 
 in the European Union, Germani, France, Italy ... who are transforming theirs 
 Economies in "War Economy" (yesterday - 
 February 23 -, reports the manifesto, an allocation was to study 
 urgency of 1.4 billion to buy oblici from third countries ... the EU has 
 Ukraine financed with 88 billion from the beginning of the war, between aid 
 military, financial assistance, allocations for the reception of refugees, 
 6 million people).

 <p class="MsoNormal">
  And to leave no doubt about their will to 
 continue to keep the war alive and to enlarge it day after day, breaking 
 The illusion of pacifists of all kinds, the imperialism of the United States and a 
 follow all other imperialist countries announce daily 
 initiatives, such as that of US imperialism that speaks of the opening of 
 5 other new military bases in Somalia! In fact by strengthening their control 
 right on the Red Sea. In fact, it says an article of "Pagineesteri": “In the Gulf 
 by Aden the US have already deployed various means and the eiisenhower aircraft carrier but the 
 Somalia could provide a useful platform from which to launch attacks 
 Against the Houthi Yemeniti and in general perfect control of the Mar 
 Red."
  <o:p>

 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">
  Always in the article it is said: “During a ceremony 
 chaired by Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, the business person 
 US Shane Dixon and Somali Defense Minister Abdulkadir Mohamed 
 NUR have signed a memorandum of understanding in Mogadishu for the construction of 
 Five military bases for the Danab brigade, the army elite unit 
 Somali national team trained by the green caps of Washington. The Danab brigade 
 It was established in 2017 following an agreement between the United States and Somalia 
 To form and equip 3000 men and women from all over the country.
  <o:p>
  </o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">
  “According to the agreement, the United States must create some 
 Military infrastructure in Baidoa, Dusa Mareb, Jowhar, Chisimaio and Mogadishu, 
 to be used for training new units of special bodies 
 of the Somali army, in charge of "contrasting the threat of terrorism 
 international "[and this is the most classic excuse that should justify the intervention 
 armed with imperialist countries, editor's note], as a note from the president says 
 Mohamud in reference to the militias of the "Popular Resistance Movement in the 
 Land of the two migrations », Sunni fundamentalist movement better known as al 
 Shabaab ("young people") and federated to Al Qaeda. "
  <o:p>
  </o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">
  In the meantime, the US also treat “With Ghana, Costa 
 ivory and Benin to get three military bases where to allocate as many 
 Squadriglie of drones .. "
  <o:p>
  </o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">
  These new bases add up to those already existing in Gibuti 
 belonging to
  <b>
   Germany, Spain, Italy, France, the United States, the United Kingdom, 
 China and Saudi Arabia,
  </b>
  located at a very short distance from each other. And all 
 On the Red Sea!
  <o:p>
  </o:p>

 <p class="MsoNormal">
  As you can see from this, but there are many other news, (for 
 Italian imperialism The military "missions" around the world of 
 Fascist Meloni) The preparation of the "total" imperialist war goes on e 
 "The genocidal Zionist attack on the Palestinian people ... does 
 This area one of the great world outbreaks ... for these reasons, be a 
 favor of the struggle of the Palestinian people, to be in favor of solidarity 
 which is expressed in the area, and particularly in the Red Sea, be in favor that 
 In this area the justice, peace and freedom of the 
 peoples, means fighting in our country to produce results 
 also positive for the proletarians and the Italian people. " (from
