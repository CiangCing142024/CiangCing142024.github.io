    The United States have shown that they are willing to go 
 "very far" in disavowing international law to defend 
  The Israeli government, Paul Reichler said during an audience

   <br/>
   <br/>
   Monday, one of the lawyers representing Palestine at most 
 Alta Court of the United Nations, accused the United States of defending 
  systematically violations of international law committed by 
 Israel, including the brutal occupation of Gaza, West Bank and 
 East Jerusalem, which has lasted for over 57 years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Paul Reichler, an American lawyer who boasts a record of successes 
 at the International Court of Justice (CIG), he declared during 
  A historical hearing on the Israeli employment of the territory 
 Palestinian that the United States are almost alone in an attempt to provide 
  a legal coverage to the actions of the Israeli government in the last 
 sixty years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The "two exceptions" between the nations that intervened in the case of 
 Cig on the employment of Israel are the Figi and the United States, he said 
  Reichler.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It is not surprising: any crime is committed by Israel against the 
 international law, the United States rise to subtract it from 
 His responsibilities, "he continued.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the written memory to the CIG, Reichler observed, the United States 
 "They argue that belligerent employment is regulated exclusively by 
  international humanitarian law and not from the United Nations Charter 
  or from general international law ".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "In this case the United States try to defend Israel not 
 claiming that the employment is legitimate, but that it is neither legitimate nor 
 illegitimate, "said Reichler, adding that this position is in 
 direct contrast with that of its allies, including France and 
 Swiss.

   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Until the point of the United States, ignoring the legal precept 
 international, they will go to subtract Israel from the consequences 
 of its continuous violation of peremptory rules, including the ban on 
  acquisition of the territory by force? "He asked for Reichler." A 
 Apparently very far ".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Reichler's introduction followed the observations of the 
 Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad Al-Maliki, who said 
  that "the genocide in progress in Gaza is the result of decades of impunity 
  and inaction "in the face of illegal employment of Israel and al 
 kidnapping of the Palestinian land.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "To put an end to Israel's impunity is a moral, political and legal imperative," said Al-Maliki.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Monday presentations kicked off a week of hearings 
 public the International Court of Justice that examine the 
 Legality of the Israeli employment of the Palestinian territory.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The United States will present their arguments on the case on Wednesday. Israel will not participate.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The procedure started less than a month after the Court 
 international justice has issued a provisional sentence that 
 orders the Israeli government to avoid acts of genocide in Gaza, one 
 decision that Israel has repeatedly disregarded by continuing to 
 commit atrocity in the enclave and targeting the city of Rafah, 
 severely overcrowded.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Israeli forces killed more than 29,000 people in Gaza since 7 October.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Agn√®s Callamard, general secretary of Amnesty International, has 
 declared on Monday that "the current conflict that encourages the strip of 
  Gaza employed, where the International Court of Justice has established 
 that there is a real and imminent risk of genocide, has focused on the 
 catastrophic consequences in allowing the crimes 
 International of Israel in [occupied Palestinian territories] 
 They have continued impunity for such long time ".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The world must recognize that the end of the illegal employment of 
 Israel is a prerequisite to stop the recurring violations of 
 human rights in Israel and in the occupied Palestinian territories ", has 
 Added Callamard.
