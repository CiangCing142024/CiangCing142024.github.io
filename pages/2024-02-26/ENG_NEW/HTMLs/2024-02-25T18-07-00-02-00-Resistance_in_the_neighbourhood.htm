  'Final solutions' and painful questions

  The Zionist policy aims at the "final solution" of the Palestinian issue with the clearance of the Palestinians and the creation of a purely Israeli state in the land of Palestine.

  The Palestinian Mackele in Gaza continues without stopping by the Israeli forces. Tens of thousands of murdered, so many others and more crushed, hundreds of thousands of outskirts. This constant crime, the "sensitive" West not only overtakes it, but also enhances the Zionist atrocities by all means offering money and weapons. No coincidence of course. After all, the "democratic" West itself has a long tradition of mass extermination of all peoples. Much more that was the same as promoting the creation of the Zionist state as its own advanced prison in the Middle East.
 </div>
 <div style="text-align: justify;">
  <br/>
 </div>
 <div style="text-align: justify;">
  On the basis of these data it is not surprising that Zionist propaganda, assisted by the dominant western media, is trying to justify the continued slaughter of the Palestinians. He argues that Israel exercises the "legal right to defense", that it is fighting against terrorism and ruthless killers. This is the "usual" reversal of reality. Let's see.

  The real data
 </div>
 <div style="text-align: justify;">
  <br/>
 </div>
 <div style="text-align: justify;">
  Which truth attacks whom? Who terrorizes who? Who is killing who?
 </div>
 <div style="text-align: justify;">
  <br/>
 </div>
 <div style="text-align: justify;">
  a) In the 1882 census it was found that Jews made up 3% of the Palestinian population, Christians 9% and Arabs 88%. So when, at the start of this, 3% came to claim 100% of Palestine against 88% (or even 97%), who is the attacker and who is the defender?
 </div>
 <div style="text-align: justify;">
  <br/>
 </div>
 <div style="text-align: justify;">
  (b) The Zionist state was born in blood and through the wildest terrorism of armed Jewish formations (Hagana, Irgun and Stern). A terrorism even against the patrons of the British with the blasting of the British mission hotel-highway that buried 200 English officers, as well as the murder of UN Bernadote mediator. With the terrorist attacks against the unarmed and disorganized Palestinians and with the aim of expulsion from their land. The bloodthirsty symbol of their pursuits is the slaughter of Der Yassin, who, as the "leftist" Golda Merr was indirectly and cynically admitted, served these aspirations. A Palestinian terrorist policy that continued continuously from then to the present day.
 </div>
 <div style="text-align: justify;">
  <br/>
 </div>
 <div style="text-align: justify;">
  c) As far as the issue of the murder is concerned, it is a fact that there have been many victims on the side of Israel throughout this time. There is, however, no comparison in relation to the victims of the other side. The number of Palestinians who were murdered during these decades by the Israeli occupation forces is unmistakable. A murderous orgy that continues nowadays in the long -awaited gauze and in the western van.
 </div>
 <div style="text-align: justify;">
  <br/>
 </div>
 <div style="text-align: justify;">
  To the "final solution"?
 </div>
 <div style="text-align: justify;">
  <br/>
 </div>
 <div style="text-align: justify;">
  What and why all this. The main aim of Israeli imperialist protectors is to keep it as the strong basis of their policy in the Middle East. At the same time and in a way that their relations with other Arab countries are not disturbed. It is only that the policy of the Zionists, taking advantage of this relationship, aims even further. It aims at the "final solution" of the Palestinian issue by clearing the Palestinians and the creation of a purely Israeli state in the land of Palestine. With constant terrorism, imprisonment, torture, displacements, murders and the constant expansion of settlements. In relation to this pursuit it is interesting to see some more things.
 </div>
 <div style="text-align: justify;">
  <br/>
 </div>
 <div style="text-align: justify;">
  The inner assumptions
 </div>
 <div style="text-align: justify;">
  <br/>
 </div>
 <div style="text-align: justify;">
  One of the greatest crimes in the history of mankind was the mass extermination of Jews by the Nazis. Explanable, therefore, that on the basis of the trauma carried by the Jews, they revolt when one compares their policy towards the Palestinians with the Nazis against the Jews. Only they should probably look in the mirror.
 </div>
 <div style="text-align: justify;">
  <br/>
 </div>
 <div style="text-align: justify;">
  So let's go to what Gideon Levi, a distinguished Israeli journalist and writer, mentioned. He said that in the context of Israeli politics and society, some perceptions dominate a significant degree.
 </div>
 <div style="text-align: justify;">
  <br/>
 </div>
 <div style="text-align: justify;">
  (a) How the Israelis are the wealthy people and therefore are entitled to act as they want.
 </div>
 <div style="text-align: justify;">
  <br/>
 </div>
 <div style="text-align: justify;">
  (b) How are the victims of history and therefore cannot be characterized by Palestinians.
 </div>
 <div style="text-align: justify;">
  <br/>
 </div>
 <div style="text-align: justify;">
  (c) How they consider the Palestinians a inferior human species and therefore it is normal to treat them even in an inhumane way.
 </div>
 <div style="text-align: justify;">
  <br/>
 </div>
 <div style="text-align: justify;">
  Unpleasant questions
 </div>
 <div style="text-align: justify;">
  <br/>
 </div>
 <div style="text-align: justify;">
  So, based on all the data that has accumulated a course of so many years, some serious questions can be raised.
 </div>
 <div style="text-align: justify;">
  <br/>
 </div>
 <div style="text-align: justify;">
  a) What is the difference between the Jews' belief that they are the wealthy people and the Hitler "Deutschland über Alles"?
 </div>
 <div style="text-align: justify;">
  <br/>
 </div>
 <div style="text-align: justify;">
  b) What is the difference between the Nazi perception that classified Jews in the category of human beings and opinions in Israel who treat the Palestinians as a lower kind of people?
 </div>
 <div style="text-align: justify;">
  <br/>
 </div>
 <div style="text-align: justify;">
  c) What is the difference between the intentions of the Nazis to impose as a "final solution" to the Jewish issue the mass extermination of the Jews and the policy that sees as a "final solution" to the Palestinian issue of the mass extermination-demolition of the Palestinians and the creation of purely Israeli State on the territory of Palestine?
 </div>
 <div style="text-align: justify;">
  <br/>
 </div>
 <div style="text-align: justify;">
  The answers, to the reader's judgment.
