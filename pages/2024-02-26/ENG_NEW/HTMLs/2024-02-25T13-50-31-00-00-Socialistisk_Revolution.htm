  All of these comrades have in common that they defend the earth and fight against the introduction of CIIT. All of these comrades and their communities are victims of the old state's oppression, who continue to escalate, which also leaves comrades threatened, wounded, detained and even murdered, as is the case with our comrades Luis Armando Fuentes Aquino, Jesús Manuel García Martínez and Félix Vicente Cruz. For all these reasons, we maintain that the interoceanic corridor removes and murders poor farmers and and native people!
 </p>
 <p class="has-text-align-justify">
  As an organization, we confirm our solidarity with the persecuted, prosecuted and political prisoners, and with the communities and organizations that have decided to continue the fight against the introduction of this imperialist mega project with expropriation and death. We continue to call for unity between the democratic and revolutionary forces in our region to build a strong movement that makes it possible what we have said before: Isthmus is ours! Not for the imperialist mega projects.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Freedom and acquittal to political prisoners!
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   No to the Inter-Coean Corridor!
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   No matter who reigns, the rights of the people will be defended!
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   With the red sun, the people will win!
