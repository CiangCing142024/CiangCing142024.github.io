  The state issues legal resolutions against activists and defenders of the soil
 </h2>
 <p>
  · We condemn the strongest criminalization against activists and defenders of the country.
 </p>
 <p>
  · The political use of judicial power is a clear example of state oppression.
 </p>
 <p>
  People's flow Red Sol raises its voice against the new legal resolutions that attack our comrades from Santa Maria Mixteecequilla and Puente Madera, like many other comrades in the region, fighting against the introduction of the Inter-Aeanian corridor, an imperial mega project that has led to The split between several communities, an increase in crime, paramilitary violence and forced dispensation of indigenous people from their country and territory, as well as much more.
 </p>
 <p>
  Faced with the worthy opposition performed by activists, communities and democratic organizations, the old state responds with arbitrary arrests and judgments confirming the political use of the judgment; This is a clear example of oppression that exists in the device.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the last February 2, a control judge from the Tanivet joined the legitimate precautionary measure with preventive detention against the 9 activists from Civil Resistance MixTequilla who was arrested in the middle of a powerful operation in early 27 January in Santa Maria, Mixteeceus and Oaxaca . Our comrades Adelaido López Gallegos, Armando Sánchez Gómez, Orlando de La Cruz Gallegos, Roberto Vázquez Orozco, Ricardo Vargas Ruiz, Albino Palacios Orozco, Jorge Ontiveros álvarez, Alba Pérez.
 </p>
 <p>
  February 7 sentenced a district judge from Salina Cruz, Puente Madera the social actor and member of
  <em>
   The congregation of indigenous peoples on isthmus in defense of soil and territory
  </em>
  (Apiidtt). Comrade David Hernández Salazar and 17 other defendants can go free thanks to a legal assessment.

 <p>
  All of these comrades have a common defense of the soil and the fight against the imposition of Ciit. All of these comrades and their communities are victims of the oppression of the old state, who continue to escalate, leaving comrades threatened, injured, arrested and even murdered, which is the case with our comrades Luis Armando Fuentes Aquino, Jesús Manuel Garcínez and Félix Vicente Cruz. For all these reasons, we confirm that the inter-osean corridor expands and murders poor farmers and indigenous peoples!
 </p>
 <p>
  As an organization, we confirm our solidarity with the persecuted, defendants and the political prisoners, and with the communities and organizations that have decided to maintain the fight against the imposition of this imperialist mega project of forced disagreement and death. We continue to encourage unity among the democratic and revolutionary forces in our region to build a powerful movement that enables what we have said before: Isthmus is ours! Not the imperialist mega projects.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Freedom and acquittal for political prisoners!
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   No to the introduction of the inter-zeanic corridor!
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   No matter who controls,
  </strong>
  <strong>
   will
  </strong>
  <strong>
   the rights of the people
  </strong>
  <strong>
   be defended
  </strong>
  <strong>
   !
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   With the red sun, the people will prevail!
