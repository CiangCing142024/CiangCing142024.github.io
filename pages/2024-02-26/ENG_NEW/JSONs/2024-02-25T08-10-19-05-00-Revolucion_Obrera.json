President Pastrana with the creation of the ESMAD - in the middle of the negotiations with the FARC guerrillas - turned a turn in the State Security strategy, going from emphasizing the counterattack fight to do so about the fight against the call \u00ab Internal enemy \u00bbfor guaranteeing the internal security of the bourgeois state, placing as the main enemy the popular masses that rise in struggle for economic, social and political claims and that at the time surpassed the available police force that could no longer contain The masses revolutionary struggle.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Today the ESMAD was \"replaced\" by the Unit of Dialogue and Maintenance of the Order - Undmo, as part of the breaches of the Petro's reformist government, which in the campaign promised the dismantling of the Esmad and which was collected in the\n   <a href=\"https://revolucionobrera.com/actualidad/reivindicaciones/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">\n    Immediate program\n   </a>\n   proposed by the UOC (MLM), but which, in the facts it was barely made up with the change of name and colors in its clothing.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   His actions of excessive violence against protesters, continues the same as always.

The shotguns remain pointed on the bodies of popular fighters and continue to violate the protocols that say they must be fired perpendicularly.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   In summary, the Police - as part of the central pillar of the bourgeois state - continues to repress the unarmed masses, the reformist government headed by Petro breached their political campaign promise to dismantle the esmad, the town continues to fight on the streets almost daily and The revolutionaries must put ourselves at the height of the moment, linking with the fighters in the streets, in the confrontations, in the troops, to learn from them and raise the level of the popular street struggle, necessary complement to the popular assemblies in which the Masses should decide what to do their revolutionary actions and through shock groups or first lines - as embryos of popular militias - must be forced to yield to the reactionary ruling classes in the face of the demands of the masses through violence Revolutionary in the middle of an upcoming popular outbreak, in which the Petro government must decide which side is, if the murderous and exploitative classes, or on the side of the fighter and worker people.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   For the effective dismantling of the esmad and paramilitarism, the liberation of prisoners to fight and the dissolution of armed bodies linked to massacres and state crimes, unity, organization and struggle!\n  </p>\n </div>\n</div>\n", "source": "https://revolucionobrera.com/actualidad/esmad-6/", "type": "article", "title": "24F: day against police brutality!
