Israel will not participate.\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n   The procedure started less than a month after the Court \n international justice has issued a provisional sentence that \n orders the Israeli government to avoid acts of genocide in Gaza, one \n decision that Israel has repeatedly disregarded by continuing to \n commit atrocity in the enclave and targeting the city of Rafah, \n severely overcrowded.\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n   Israeli forces killed more than 29,000 people in Gaza since 7 October.\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n   Agn\u00e8s Callamard, general secretary of Amnesty International, has \n declared on Monday that \"the current conflict that encourages the strip of \n  Gaza employed, where the International Court of Justice has established \n that there is a real and imminent risk of genocide, has focused on the \n catastrophic consequences in allowing the crimes \n International of Israel in [occupied Palestinian territories] \n They have continued impunity for such long time \".\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n   \"The world must recognize that the end of the illegal employment of \n Israel is a prerequisite to stop the recurring violations of \n human rights in Israel and in the occupied Palestinian territories \", has \n Added Callamard.\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n  </span>\n </div>\n <hr/>\n <table border=\"0\">\n  <tbody>\n   <tr>\n    <td>\n     <img alt=\"Resistenze.org\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.resistenze.org/sito/zresistenze150.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.resistenze.org/sito/zresistenze150.jpg\"/>\n    </td>\n    <td>\n    </td>\n    <td>\n     <div>\n      <span>\n       Support resistance.org.\n      </span>\n     </div>\n    </td>\n   </tr>\n  </tbody>\n </table>\n <div style=\"clear: both;\">\n </div>\n</div>\n", "description": "To the International Court of Justice, Palestine lawyer reproaches the United States to defend \"any crime\" committed ...", "author": ["maoist"], "source": "https://proletaricomunisti.blogspot.com/2024/02/pc-25-febbraio-stati-uniti-difendono.html"}
