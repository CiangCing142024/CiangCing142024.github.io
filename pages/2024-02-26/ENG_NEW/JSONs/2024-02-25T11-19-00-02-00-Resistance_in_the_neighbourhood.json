In addition to a change of border, which is considered a non -reversible situation, it is unlikely to accept a guaranteed and controlled demilitarization - neutralization regime as Moscow requires.\n </p>\n <p>\n  US reports leave no room for doubts. The White House will not support Kiev businesses to recover Russia's occupied territories. However, a sense of (number two of the State Department) Nulaland (number two of the State Department) before leaving Kiev after an official visit.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He talked about reversals in the battlefields of Ukraine, with the US continuing to provide support to Ukraine, with new investments and new weapons systems already on the way. Finally, it praised the growth of the Ukrainian economy from 4% to 5%, which ... \"the countries of the world must be jealous\"! Statements that not only contradict the surrounding atmosphere of the \"American political corridors\", but also ignore the fact that the \"Republican\" Congress has clarified the \"help package\" in Ukraine.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As intense the discussions lately about the future of Western support in Ukraine, and the new US and EU aid package, so intense is their reluctance. The 27 EU leaders finally agreed to an additional \u20ac 50 billion support package in 2 installments, but EU chief diplomat Borll said: \"It is important to clarify the situation and know where we are now, We are in March and by the end of the year. \" The agreement contains annual evaluations of \"aid\", as everyone is ignoring its route within Ukraine. After all, the price is $ 40 billion a year (as much as Ukraine's fiscal deficit)!\n </p>\n <p>\n  Kiev's pious desire is for the EU to decide the confiscation of Russian assets. The issue is on the agenda since the launch of the \"Russian Special Enterprise\" in Ukraine. Again, Borrell clarified: \"At the moment we are talking about interest revenue, and I am convinced that this will be completed in the near future.\" Politically, this seizure is justified as a \"advance payment\", which the Kremlin should pay to Ukraine. But the loser is the one who pays compensation! And that tilts to Ukraine. In relation to this, the ECB has announced that the EU financial system would be destabilized, taking into account Moscow's countermeasures, which concern seizures of Western assets. Their volume was estimated (late 2022) at $ 288 billion, according to national statistics of Western countries.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Kiev regime continues on the basis of the original goal: \"to expel the enemy from all over Ukraine\", implying that, no matter how bad things seem, in the future Ukraine will overturn the data. Kiev or refuses to accept reality or expects the \"bar\" of the West-Russia controversy. But how;\n </p>\n <p>\n  However, the fact that shocked Zelenski's Western friends is about the downfall, in the Russian airspace, a plane carrying 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war scheduled for exchange. Three Russian military and six crew members were also killed. Initially, the collapse was attributed to Kiev actions on the grounds that it was carrying materials for the S-300 missile systems, intended for attacks on Kharkov. Soon, however, the involvement of the Kiev forces disappear from the Ukrainian media, as well as any reference to the supposed load!\n </p>\n <p>\n  The logical assumption is that the Ukrainian side had been informed of this flight, in the same way that Russia is informed of visits to foreign leaders to Kiev. The \"unjustified\" of the thing may concern internal contradictions.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Ukrainian president recently asked his country's top general, Zalouzni, to resign, but he refused, \"triggering\" various speculations. The tense relationship begins after it becomes visible that the Ukrainian counterattack cannot achieve its goals (the recovery of occupied territories and the cut of the \"land bridge\" to Crimea). Zalouzni had said that the war had reached a \"deadlock\", with the president's office scolding him. Other statements followed, at all compatible with those of the Presidential Environment. Which environment considers them political rather than military statements.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Although Washington wants to avoid an open conflict between Zelenski and Zalouzni, the US (writes Berliner Zeitung, citing Ukrainian sources) is more likely to support the commander -in -chief than the president in the event of a shocking conflict between them. Rumors of intrigues around the face of General Zalouzni or the accusations of Zelenski's authoritarianism, expressed by the Mayor of Kiev, Klitsko, can only be some visible elements of the background in Kiev, however, reflect some general polarization in society.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Meanwhile, Moscow does not seem to be in a hurry for \"peace talks\", as the Ukrainian forces seem to have already lost the possibility of taking off. The initiative has passed on its own side and it seems that it notes slow but steady progress in the east and southern part of the country. And earnings and territories.\n </p>\n <p>\n  We do not know if Zelenski and his environment believe that yet another \"narrative counterattack\" can offset the real defeat in the real battlefield. However, the western media, speaking of \"impasse on the fronts of conflict\", describe a situation that does not look like a deadlock. It looks like being on the verge of defeat.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This is also evident from the fact that Russia is upgrading its demands ... \"The demilitarized zone in Ukraine should be promoted farther away, at a distance from which it is impossible to bomb peaceful cities,\" Putin told Moscow on January 31. \"The line should be at such a distance from our territory to ensure security\" ... The maps are \"photographing\" all over Ukraine!\n </p>\n <p>\n  Strategic planning officers in both Washington and Europe are sure to be on the basis of a B project, that is, to respond to a Russian victory. However, Ukraine is now a field of political confrontation in the US (and not only) and we may not have to wait for the next administration in the White House to have a new US policy in Ukraine.\n </p>\n <p>\n  XB\n </p>\n <div style=\"clear: both;\">\n </div>\n</div>\n", "description": "", "author": ["\u03a3\u03b1\u0390\u03c4\u03b1"], "labels": ["\u039f\u03c5\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03b1", "\u03a0\u03c1\u03bf\u03bb\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae \u03a3\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03af\u03b1"], "source": "https://antigeitonies3.blogspot.com/2024/02/blog-post_25.html"}
