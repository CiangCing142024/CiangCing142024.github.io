Women and children were made to \n pieces during the war, the parents were unable to recognize theirs \n children killed due to the bombings.\n    <br/>\n    At this moment our \n union members collectively decided to refuse to \n Moving all types of armed loads.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The loading and unloading of these weapons helps to provide the ability to kill innocent people.\n    <br/>\n    Therefore, we, port workers and Indian ports of various large ones \n active ports in the load handling sector, we ask that \n  Anyone who refuses to move all types of armed loads.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We ask our members not to move more ships who transport military material to Palestine/Israel.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    We therefore also ask for an immediate ceasefire. As unions \n We declare our solidarity with those who fight for peace. \n  We appeal to the workers of the world and to the people who love the \n peace to support the request for a free Palestine.\n   </p>\n  </div>\n </div>\n <div style=\"clear: both;\">\n </div>\n</div>\n", "description": "Appeal ...", "author": ["maoist"], "source": "https://proletaricomunisti.blogspot.com/2024/02/pc-19-febbraio-anche-nei-porti.html"}
