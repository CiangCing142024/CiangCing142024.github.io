In the country, there is virtually no demarcation of indigenous lands and quilombola territories and equally no agrarian reform policy, and the government claims that it has no resources for it. Meanwhile released 364 billion in 2023 for the agribusiness crop plan.\n  </p>\n  <p style='background-color: white; box-sizing: border-box; font-family: \"roboto serif\", sans-serif; font-size: 16px; margin: 0px 0px 24px; text-align: start;'>\n   <span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bolder;\">\n    The far-right landowner that was institutionalized in this old state, organized, set up and strengthened during the Bolsonaro government continues to act freely and encouraged by government cowing, particularly in Bahia. The approval of the temporal framework represents a blow to the original peoples and further fosters these attacks. In December 2023 Cacique Patax\u00f3, 31 -year -old Lucas Kariri Sapuy\u00e1 was shot dead in an ambush in the same indigenous territory. In August last year, the Pacific Bernadete Quilombola leadership was murdered with 14 heads in the head.\n   </span>\n  </p>\n  <p style='background-color: white; box-sizing: border-box; font-family: \"roboto serif\", sans-serif; font-size: 16px; margin: 0px 0px 24px; text-align: start;'>\n   Throughout the country, there are hundreds of attacks against indigenous peoples, peasants and quilombolas and their leaders and as in the recent case, the police often act to cover the armed flocks of the landlord, threatening, intimidating and disarming communities. In addition, there are several complaints from the performance of police directly in these strongly armed paramilitary flocks, along with gunmen, through private security companies that set up, train, finance and run the extermination groups, such as Mariele Franco.\n  </p>\n  <p style='background-color: white; box-sizing: border-box; font-family: \"roboto serif\", sans-serif; font-size: 16px; margin: 0px 0px 24px; text-align: start;'>\n   The governor of Bahia Jeronimo Rodrigues has now announced the creation of a PM company to \u201cmediate\u201d agrarian conflicts in the state.
