In recent events, Incra has avoided positioning itself alongside the peasants. In an audience on 01/09, decisive for reintegration, the agency was exempt from determining whether or not the lands were public or not, despite having access to documents that prove that the lands are public and have already classified them That way in 2017.\n     </p>\n     <p class=\"wp-block-heading\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-top: 1.25em; overflow-wrap: break-word;\">\n      <span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 700;\">\n       <span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 14pt;\">\n        \u2018Declaration of War\u2019\n       </span>\n      </span>\n     </p>\n     <p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-top: 1.25em; overflow-wrap: break-word;\">\n      But it is evident that the squatters will follow. Regardless of suspended, the repossession, based on a notably fraudulent and without legal basis, imposed against more than 300 families of a longtime camp is a serious case of violation of people's rights. For LCP, the case configures a \u201cdeclaration of war for peasants\u201d.\n     </p>\n     <p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-top: 1.25em; overflow-wrap: break-word;\">\n      \u201cWe claim: Although not fulfilled, the possibility of a repossession against peasants who live and produce in an area won with a fight for at least 14 years (the fight had happened before the peasants of the area join the LCP , entering the land and performing the \u201cpopular cut\u201d), is a statement of war against the peasants.
