  On February 18, about 300 residents of the cities of Capela de Santa and Montenegro blocked RS-250 in protest against the installation of two tolls from the Caminhos da Serra Gaucha (CSG) company. The company charges absurd prices to the city's workers. Most, workers live in other municipalities and need to pay the fee every day, both ways.
 </p>
 <p>
  Residents gathered at km 30 of RS-240, near the border between Chapel de Santana and Montenegro, to protest against the installation of tolls. One of them costs $ 9.00 in both directions, and the other $ 12.30, also in both directions. There is no exemption for residents of any city. Traffic was periodically stopped by protesters, causing countless financial losses to CSG.
 </p>
 <p>
  During the act were made harsh criticism of the state government, the municipalities and the CSG. In an interview residents denounced the lack of credibility in deputies and mayors, who in addition to supporting the concession of roads to CSG, also did not consult with the population for the installation of the toll and failed in all their electoral promises. During the act, a deputy went to the microphone to try to wash the hands of the situation, saying that he was always against the installation of the toll, but was rejected and demoralized by the masses.
 </p>
 <p>
  In September last year, residents of the neighboring city of gate organized a protest against another CSG toll, the mobilization of residents led the company to close the toll and reopen the deviations it had blocked.
