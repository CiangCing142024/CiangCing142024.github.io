         Patiala, District, February 17, 2024:
        </strong>
        Amidst the 
ongoing farmer protest, the Communist Party of India (Maoist) has 
extended its support to the demonstrators stationed currently along the 
Punjab-Haryana border.
        <p>
         According to a copy of the press release issued by the Maoist party, 
the Maoists have extended their support to the one-day shutdown call 
given by the farmer unions on Friday, February 16.
        </p>
        <p>
         Via the press release, the Maoist party has alleged that the 
incumbent union government is corporate friendly and has been treating 
the farmers as enemies of the State. Further, while making an appeal to 
the masses for their support to the said protest the Maoists in the 
press release alleged that the government has continued to bar the entry
 of the farmers at the Shambhu village border.
        </p>
        <p>
         The press release further claimed that all the demands of the farmers
 are legitimate but the government is not willing to fulfill them.
