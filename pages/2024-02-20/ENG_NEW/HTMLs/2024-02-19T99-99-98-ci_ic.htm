  Proletarians from all countries, unite!
 </p>
 <p>
  In the middle of the anniversary of the 130 years since the birth of President Mao Țze-Dun, we celebrate the first anniversary of the International Communist League:
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Raise the red flag of unification under Marxism-Leninism-Maoism to carry out the tasks of the new situation!
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  On the occasion of the first anniversary of the establishment of the International Communist League (LCI), we send to the International Proletariat and to the people of the world our firm proletarian greeting. Our greeting is addressed to the international communist movement and the folk wars, which, in the middle of the new storms of the world proletarian revolution and the intensified reaction attacks, strive to provide orientation and management: by creating and making communist parties as struggle tools for the conquest of political power. . With profound feelings of proletarian internationalism, we currently convey our greeting greeting to the heroic struggle of national resistance in Palestine!
 </p>
 <p>
  This year, the communists and revolutionaries celebrate the 130 years since the birth of the Great Cut, President Mao Tze-Dun, who personally led two of the greatest events in the history of proletariat: the Chinese Revolution, which opened the way of the new democratic revolution in the countries. oppressed; And the great proletarian cultural revolution, a titanic battle that planted the seeds of the revolution throughout the world, which flourished in the current popular wars and in the new wave of firm struggle for the reconstruction of communist parties under the leadership of Maoism in several countries worldwide. With President Mao Ţze-Dun, the proletarian movement has developed the most powerful and invincible weapon, its ideology, in the third and new stage of Marxism; Marxism-Leninism-Maoism, the weapon with which the proletariat and the people of the world will sweep the imperialism and the reaction on the face of the earth.
 </p>
 <p>
  With class hatred, we condemn revisionism and opportunism. The capitalist restoration in China has left the communists without a supporting basis for the world proletarian revolution. We reject the reactionary Xi Jinping who, with "his thinking XI Jinping" and his fascist "socialism with Chinese characteristics", tries to deceive the people of the world about the meaning of socialism and struggle against imperialism. But for proletariat there is no definitive defeat; As President Mao stressed, the only logic of the people is to fight, to fail, to fight, to fail and so on until victory. The capitalist restorations of the USSR since 1956 and from China in 1976 cannot stop the revolutionary march of international proletariat on its way to the final installation in power. These defeats are only moments in the development of the contradiction between revolution and counter -revolution, from which we draw learning to prevent restorations in the future.
 </p>
 <p>
  The international communist movement and the national liberation movement go through decisive moments, we are witnessing the beginning of a turning point in the fight between revolution and counter -revolution, at the opening of a new period of revolution in the world proletarian revolution.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just a year ago, it was proudly announced by class and heroism to establish a new international proletariat organization - International Communist League. 15 communist parties and organizations were united at the international (humorous) international conference around three basic lines: 1) mlm, 2) fight against revisionism and 3) the world proletarian revolution. The common statement of principles and foundations defined the establishment of the International Communist League as being
  <em>
   "A step to reunify and overcome the dispersion from the international communist movement (...), being opened a new stage of the struggle organized for the reconstruction of the communist international under the leadership and guidance of the Maoism."
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  One year after this event, the objective situation of the world is characterized by an additional intensification of fundamental contradictions, especially the main contradiction between imperialism and oppressed peoples and nations. The general crisis of capitalism in its imperialist stage has reached a new culminating moment in which seizures and rashes of great importance take place. From an economic point of view, at present the deepest crisis of the world imperialist system of World War II is in progress, forming the basis of serious political crises, which, in turn, deepest the economic crisis. American imperialism, as the only hegemonic superpower, is in decline and tries by all means to advance in achieving its strategic objective to maintain and extend its position, even if it is increasingly difficult to make its plans to It snatches the status of nuclear superpowering of Russian imperialism and preventing the ascension of the social-immperialist China. After the failures in Syria and Afghanistan, the development of the Ukraine war is also a clear example of the degree to which the political crisis of imperialism has renewed and renew our next position.
  <em>
   "The only way to follow for the people of Ukraine is to rely on their own forces and to defend the nation, against the foreign invader and the traitors selling the country."
  </em>
  . From the interimperialist contradiction, a tendency to expand the imperialist war is detached, which is currently expressed by the strong impulse of the armor, militarism and the reintensing of their failed counter -revolutionary offensive. In order to maintain its position, American imperialism strengthens its hegemonic ambitions on its alliances and allies, especially on NATO countries, but instead deepens its crisis and reveals its character of
  <em>
   "Colossus with clay legs"
  </em>
  . Although there are clear and certain signs of a new world war, it is not imminent, and the communists have the task of leading all those forces that are mobilized in the face of this situation and who return spontaneously against imperialism. The assessment of the principle statement that
  <em>
   "... the movement against the imperialist war will increase with the revolt against the exploitation and oppression of the class and the increasing poverty of the masses ..."
  </em>
  It proved to be correct and oriented towards the future. In addition to the mass movements in the oppressed countries, the struggles of workers and peoples in the imperialist countries also intensified, highlighting the great revolts of the masses in France.
 </p>
 <p>
  From the international proletariat and the oppressed peoples and nations, we see that a new wave of revolutions-in an unequal development. The popular wars led by the Marxist-Leninist-Maoist parties in Peru, India, Turkey and Philippines not only resisted the attacks of the counter-revolution, but have developed new initiatives and have managed to advance, while the preparation of new folk wars are underway. . In oppressed countries, peasant movements continue to develop on a huge scale and, wherever they are under proletarian leadership, their role as the main force of the new democratic revolution against imperialism, feudalism and bureaucratic capitalism becomes clear. With the offensive of the National War of Palestinian Resistance, not only the fight for a free and untouched Palestine has entered a new stage, but also favors the conditions for world-scale anti-imperialist struggle, being
  <em>
   "A sharp spear stuck in the imperialist beast which, by its example, inspires and calls the proletariat and the oppressed peoples of the world to battle and resistance."
  </em>
  , as we stated in our statement on October 8th. We renew our appeal here that the communists must be the ones who must take over the leadership of this movement, in order to apply the universal teaching that the liberation of the nation under imperialism can only be victorious under the leadership of the proletariat.
 </p>
 <p>
  Comrade, is not the evolution of the world situation an excellent evidence that the establishment of the LCI took place exactly at the right time? That the struggle for reunification of communists worldwide corresponds to the need for objective situation? We see that the essential assessments and definitions of the fundamental declaration have found their expression in this situation and have been fulfilled, that it is a good starting point for the development of the struggle for a deeper understanding of the proletarian ideology in its concrete conditions. The revolutionary unit made within the international Maoist International Conference through the fight between the two lines, under the banner of the great Marx classics, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and the president of Mao Ţze-Dun, must be developed as a living unit, which must be consolidated and further extended by deepening. discussions and strengthening the fight between the two lines. Let's rely firmly on Stalin's teachings, which, in full construction of the communist international, insisted on the development of the fight between the two lines.
  <em>
   "Abstract, but concretely, based on the political situation"
  </em>
  in which the Communists develop their struggle.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the first year of existence of the LCI, a total of ten statements and resolutions were issued and five campaigns, with international events and holidays, which were organized in over 25 countries. The international events and activities organized or supported by the LCI have managed to expand the scope and beyond the LCI member organizations and represented important steps against fragmentation and division. We welcome all parties, organizations and companions who have contributed to the fulfillment of these activities. In addition to achievements, we must recognize our limits and weaknesses to strengthen and deepen these steps. The situation in which the international communist movement is located is complex, and the challenges are large. Therefore, it will be essential to implement the tasks set with the establishment of the LCI, the objectives defined in our resolutions and statements, with even more regular and consciousness, fighting against subjectivism. In addition, the development of anti-imperialist activities, whose axis must be the defense and support of popular wars, is currently decisive to increase the LCI ranks and to broaden the basis of member organizations.
 </p>
 <p>
  The establishment of the LCI was an important climax of a complex fight over 40 years to overcome the fragmentation of the communists and to establish the unit based on Marxism-Leninism-Maoism. It is very important to understand this process, based on the great achievements of the first, the second and third international, as well as taking into account the contributions of the Communist Information Bureau, to understand the strategic importance of the task of reconstitution. of the communist international. This process teaches us that the proletarian unit has always been consolidated only in the fight against revisionism, opportunism and cleavage. Therefore, it must also be clear that the dispersion of forces has not been overcome, but the dispersion tendency was reversed towards the tendency of unification. The ideological, political, political and organizational unit made by the Unified International Maoist Conference has opened the way to develop the fight on two lines, the law of the development of the proletarian unit, in a more efficient and organized way. Therefore, we want to greet all the contributions that have been made by the respective parties and organizations from the establishment, to increase the debates and discussions and we would like to emphasize that the basis for a larger international unit is the development of the independent construction of national parties and organizations, the bases that LCI will advance. We also want to greet the statements that were addressed to us by the Maoist parties and organizations outside the international communist league. We welcome them as an important position on a debate raised by the LCI, which will serve to strengthen the international organization through two lines, through "unit-unit-unity", critical and autocritical, and to its transformation even more firmly an instrument of the world proletarian revolution. Thus we confirm our will to deepen these contacts and we hope to be able to make this effort soon in the form of an ideological debate and other bilateral meetings.
 </p>
 <p>
  The International Communist League is an instrument of the struggle of international proletariat and oppressed peoples and nations. The objective evolutions insistently demand the strengthening and strengthening of this instrument to respond to the call of organization, leadership in the world struggle against imperialism. The great political storms that develop today will turn into a subjective force of the communists only if we fulfill our main task, to make the only scientific, true, the center of international and party unity and to apply it to the concrete conditions. . Therefore, we express the need to double our efforts in the second year of LCI existence. On the one hand, to strengthen and promote international unification by organizing bilateral meetings, events, forums, debates and also to unite with those who have expressed criticisms and doubts. Division and fragmentation serve revisionism and create a fertile time. Differentiation and unification, on the other hand, will serve the main task of the new international
  <em>
   "To fight for Maoism as the sole guide and command of the world proletarian revolution, to serve the constitution or reconstitution of Marxist-Leninist-Maoist communist parties (exceptional strategic task) and to serve when initiating, developing and coordinating the popular wars For the reconstitution of the communist international ”
  </em>
  . And on the other hand, to strengthen and extend the basis among the masses and to intensify the fight within the national framework for the reconstruction/establishment or continuation of the construction of the respective parties in the service of the international communist movement. As the MAO president said, the establishment of the Chinese Communist Party has forever changed the face of the whole Chinese revolution. Today, the reconstruction of communist parties within Marxism-Leninism-Maoism will also change the face of the revolution in each country and the world proletarian revolution. For this, it is necessary, first of all, the making of the management, of the nuclei leading by comrades united under Marxism-Leninism-Maoism.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are two forces that act in the revolutionary movement around the world: the international proletarian movement and the national liberation movement. Lenin, developing Marx, lays the foundations of the World Revolution Strategy to undermine imperialism, to unite the struggle of national liberation with the struggles of the international proletarian movement and to develop the revolution. "Proletarians from all the oppressed countries and peoples in the world, unite!" MAO president - developing the strategy and tactics of the world revolution specified at that time:
  <em>
   "Marxist-Leninists from all countries, unite! Revolutionary peoples around the world, unite; Overthrow imperialism, contemporary revisionism and all reactionaries in different countries! ”
