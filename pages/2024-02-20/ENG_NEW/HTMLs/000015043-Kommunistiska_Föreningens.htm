   As the story shows, on January 21, 1924, Comrade Lenin became the great leader of the working class and the oppressed peoples in the world, the other great milestone for Marxism-Leninism-Maoism, immortal and left behind a great legacy of incomprehensible value. Comrade Lenin's teachings, which transformed the "world of the future", whose basics were laid by Marx and Engels, from an abstract opportunity for a concrete reality, is still fully relevant after a century of major upheavals in the world. In order to position yourself correctly in the class struggle, one must accept this "timeliness" and orient yourself after it. At the same time, this "timeliness" is a cure for reformist, revisionist and parliamentary cretinism, which means capitulation and compromise with ruling ideologies of all kinds. It is the guarantee of faith and determination that a communist world can be created.

   Properly identifying the contradictions in the history of the class struggle, understanding the moments of historical crimes and being ready in these times was the most prominent element of comrade Lenin's entire struggle until his immortality. After Marx and Engel's death, the leadership of the international proletariat was taken over for a long time by the second international opportunism, and in the word of comrade Stalin:

  <span style="color: #000000; font-family: bahnschrift;">
   Comrade Lenin turned the Communist Party and the Communist International into an instrument for war against the bourgeoisie by liberating the Communist Party and the Communist International's movement from the buoys of legal forms of fighting:
   <b>
    “Instead of a revolutionary policy, there was a bottled emotionalness and dirty political negotiations, parliamentary diplomacy and parliamentary intrigue. For the sake of the shine, of course, "revolutionary" resolutions and slogans were adopted ... "
   </b>
   But as it "stores in the drawers", freed from legal forms of struggle.

   Comrade Lenin, with his genius, took the core of the contradiction and realized that the fight against the bourgeoisie cannot be sufficiently effective and successful without shaking off the burdens that weigh on the back of the international proletariat, without fighting revisionism and opportunism, without showing the masses the true nature of these Opinions in theory and practice, without isolating them as far as possible. By establishing the dialectical and necessary link between the "internal struggle" and the "outer struggle", he fought the double struggle.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="color: #000000; font-family: bahnschrift;">
   Comrade Lenin gave us communists the extremely important lesson that the fight against revisionism and opportunism cannot be separated from the fight against imperialism and all forms of governing reactions. On the contrary, the fight against imperialism must be cleared from revisionism and opportunism.

 <p>
  <span style="color: #000000; font-family: bahnschrift;">
   The imperialist system, which comrade Lenin analyzed in detail in the early 1900s, has survived during the past period, but its contradictions are tightened and it is in a spiral of insoluble antagonistic contradictions. Although the resolution of the Soviet Union and the integration process in the capitalist system that China went through prevented the contradictions from exploding for a while, the law on the unequal development of capitalism continued and the interimperistic rivalry developed at the stage of "resolution". with regional war. This shows which crisis system is in and that the previous "solutions" no longer work. The imperialists, who for a long time maintained their crisis by moving the system's burdens to the semi -colonies and deepening the looting of the semi -colonies, has also ended up in a dead end.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="color: #000000; font-family: bahnschrift;">
   One of the explosive points in the inherent problems of the imperialist system, which has been developed in accordance with Lenin's definition of imperialism is that the interim materialist struggle, which has been shown in various forms in recent years, is currently being fought in regional war. When Lenin listed the contradictions of imperialism, he mentioned the interimmeristic contradiction as one of the three most important contradictions.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="color: #000000; font-family: bahnschrift;">
   We can see that the development is in line with comrade Lenin's observations on the nature and contradictions of imperialism:
   <b>
    “The second contradiction is the contradiction between the various financial groups and imperialist powers in their struggle for raw material sources, for foreign territory. Imperialism is the exports of capital to the raw material sources, the insane struggle for monopolistic possession of these sources, the struggle for a redistribution of the already divided world, a struggle that is carried out with special rage by new financial groups and powers seeking a "place in the sun" against the The old groups and powers, which persistently cling to what they have arrested. This frenetic struggle between the different groups of capitalists is remarkable in that it includes as an inevitable element imperialist war, war for annexation of foreign territories. This circumstance is, in turn, remarkable by leading to a mutual weakening of the imperialists, to a weakening of the position of capitalism in general, to an acceleration of the advent of the proletarian revolution and to the practical necessity of this revolution. "
   </b>
   (Stalin, Leninism's basics).
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="color: #000000; font-family: bahnschrift;">
   Russia and China, the former socialist countries that have given the imperialist system a respite with their new markets, have become the main actors in the interim materialist rivalry, in violation of the hegemonic power of the United States. This means that the extent and nature of the contradictions has increased as new and powerful players are gaining increasing commitment to the struggle for the redistribution of territories. The great confrontation with Russian imperialism's invasion of Ukraine took place against this background. It is predictable that this tendency will be further deepened and spread further. As long as there is no direct confrontation between the imperialists, the areas where the split wars are carried out half colonies and colonies. The half -colonies and the oppressed peoples in the world will continue to pay the price for these wars until the imperialists declare direct war against each other.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="color: #000000; font-family: bahnschrift;">
   With this
   <i>
    the division of the world into a handful of imperialist nations and a majority of oppressed countries
   </i>
   - Masterly analyzed by Lenin - deepens even more. The third contradictions are tightened with the imperialist looting, and the semi -colonial and semi -feodal increase in powerful national liberation war and folk war that shakes the imperialist system.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="color: #000000; font-family: bahnschrift;">
   Parallel to the process where imperialism goes under contradictions, the interimplyistic and the contradiction imperialist countries and oppressed people and nations; All parts of the governing system, especially the imperialist states, become more centralized, militaristic and warlike than before, which paves the way for all fascist emotions to bring society into a corresponding ideological format. This is met either by so -called right -wing extremists or under the veil of social democratic or liberal parties. Communists and the oppressed peoples in the world, in front of the reality of a system that every day becomes more reactionary and aggressive, needs a Leninist party to lead the proletariat's struggle for political power, as comrade Lenin outlined, to organize a strong opposition to this reaction. Only such a party, today a Marxist-Leninist-Maoist, can lead an irreconcilable fight against the bourgeoisie.

    A revolution is not a dinner party or like writing an essay or painting a painting or embroidery. It cannot be particularly refined, particularly quiet and mild, especially moderate, friendly, polite, mastered or magnificent. A revolution is a rebellion, a act of violence, where one class crashes another.

   It is crucial how the communists define the existing contradictions and how they position themselves before the development. During the hundreds that have passed since comrade Lenin's death, the imperialists have transformed their governing structures into even larger war machines. Their armies, police officers, intelligence services etc. are equipped with capacity that is incomparable to the past. On the other hand, a considerable part of those who call themselves "communists" or "revolutionaries" ignore this reality (although it seems theoretically accepted) and is far from positioning itself accordingly. But by following an ideological and practical reconciliation line that locks the working class and the oppressed masses in the governing system, they dampen the anger of the masses and act as a breakwater. While the imperialists and the governance's governing structures are equating themselves with increasingly violent appliances and institutions, it is necessary as supporters of comrade Lenin, to keep a strong ideological struggle against the fact that those who define themselves as "revolutionaries" and "communists" go further further And further away from reality that the revolution and the revolutionary struggle will be based on weapons and violence. Taking Comrade Lenin's relentless fight against the second international opportunism as a guide against these views is one of the important tasks to make comrade Lenin justice during the centenary of his immortality.

  <span style="color: #000000; font-family: bahnschrift;">
   Comrade Lenin defined the new type of Communist Party as the "proletariat's war organization". This definition was necessary because of the imperialist system and the mutual position of the classes. Both the process that led to the October Revolution and the Civil War that broke out with the October Revolution were the concrete reasons why Comrade Lenin called the Communist Party "The War Organization of the Proletariat". It is a necessity that the Communist Party, which will lead the liberation of the proletariat and the oppressed masses, has this property, while the counter -revolution armed from top to toe with the device's apparatus and means and commits all these terrible massacres against the working class and the oppressed peoples. A revolutionary war needs a fighting party to bring it. Only fools and indefinite auditors who rely on the bourgeoisie can see it differently.

    Some people ridicule us as advocates for "the general of war". Yes, we advocate the omniption of the revolutionary war; It's good, not bad, it's Marxist. The weapons of the Russian Communist Party created socialism. We will create a democratic republic. Experience of the class struggle during the era of imperialism teaches us that it is only through the power of the weapon that the working class and the work masses can defeat the armed bourgeoisie and landlords; In this sense we can say that only with weapons can the whole world be transformed.

   At its founding conference, IKF defined the constituency and reconstitution of the communist parties as an important task in the struggle for the proletarian world revolution. The understanding of the Communist Party developed by Comrade Mao Zedong is in line with the understanding of the Communist Party that Comrade Lenin outlined and also enriched by Stalin, and is the realization of the Leninist understanding of the party in Marxism-Leninism-Maoism's ideology. During the period of imperialism and proletarian revolutions in which we are located, the Communist Party that is capable of opposing the growing imperialist reaction and leading the proletariat and the oppressed peoples in the world must have the quality of being the "proletariat's war organization".

   An essential heritage from Lenin is the question of political power as the fundamental issue for each revolution. Lenin showed how
   <b>
    "The proletarian revolution is impossible without the violent destruction of the bourgeois state machinery and without being replaced with a new"
   </b>
   and how
   <b>
    ”ut

   . Under Lenin's personal leadership of the world's first socialist state, the dictatorship of the proletariat was established, which specified the proletarian path to power and to maintain it.

   After Lenin's death, it was his sequel Stalin who brilliantly defined Leninism, developed it and made it the foundation for the entire international communist movement. Based on the great Lenin's shoulders, chairman Mao was able to bring the proletarian world revolution to higher heights and develop the ideology of the proletariat. Leninism that is today Marxism-Leninism-Maoism must be embraced, defended and applied today.

   As IKF, we will continue to perform the tasks that the great Lenin brought up and benefit from the legacy that Comrade Lenin has left to us.
