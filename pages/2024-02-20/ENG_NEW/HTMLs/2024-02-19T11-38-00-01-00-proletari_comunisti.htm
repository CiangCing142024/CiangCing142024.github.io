    One 
  political and internationalist strike, which he assumes in 
 this historical situation a strong antimperialist connotation and 
 anti -colonial, being Israel the perfect synthesis of outpost 
 Imperialist and colonial engraved in Palestine's land to dominate 
 With the brute force, the whole Middle East.

    The unheard of 
  ferocity of the Zionists of these months against the helpless population of Gaza 
  It is directly proportional to the western decline, especially of 
 in the face of the regional scale of the resistance forces, 
 who is giving a hard time to Israel and his allies.

    The operation 
  "Flood of Al-Aqsa" conducted by the Palestinian resistance on October 7th 
  '23 has made it clear that there can be no peace in medium-orientation 
 without the satisfaction of the historic Palestinian claims, 
 while putting

    The genocidal nature of Israel.

  The fate of Zionism have always been linked to the Euro-Atlantic blockade, it is 
  It is necessary to place the political meaning of the Palestinian action 
 in the current historical phase, within a wider conflict and on 
 regional scale, in which the twilight of hegemony are intertwined 
 western and the affirmation of a multipolar world, in a framework of 
 tendency to war and inability to resolve diplomatically 
 conflicts.

 <p>
  <span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
   <span>
    This 
  it happens in a region where western hegemony was put in 
 discussion from regional powers - such as Iran -, from the arch of the 
 Resistance of the so-called Shiite crescent, and by geo-political actors 
 global such as the Russian Federation and the People's Republic of China, who 
 In a sense, they guide the redemption of global south to a world 
 multipolar.

    Also 
  countries that were the pawns of western hegemony such as Turkey - 
 NATO member - and Saudi Arabia draw their model of 
 Development and diplomatic relationships in a more detached way from the plans 
 US.

    The 
  In -act genocide does not only put the work of Israel but on trial but 
  his western complicities, constituting a punch in the stomach for 
 those who have erected spokesperson and paladins of the "human rights", which 
 Today, however, they support genocide, such as the Meloni government and the fake 
 "Opposition" of the Democratic Party

    THE 
  more conscious workers must draw important teachings from this 
 which is happening in the land of Palestine, in the Middle East but also in 
 Ukraine. Western imperialism in crisis is bringing the world 
 On the verge of war, against the countries and peoples that rebel. The 
 resources for these wars take away from wages and the whole system of 
 Welfare, through an "internal war" against popular classes.

  <span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
   <span>
    THE 
  Palestinians teach us that it is possible to raise our heads and resist 
 even in the worst conditions. We have to collect this 
 teaching and use it against the common enemies, which are the masters, 
 Imperialists and governments to their service.
