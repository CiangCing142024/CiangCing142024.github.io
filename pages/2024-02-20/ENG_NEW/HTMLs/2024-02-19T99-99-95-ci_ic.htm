  Comrade Lenin Faro of the international proletariat and great master of Marxism-Leninism-Maoism illuminates the path of the unity of the international communist movement
 </h2>
 <p>
  "We are those who form the army of the great strategist of the proletariat, the army of Comrade Lenin. There is no greater honor than that of belonging to this army. " (Stalin)
 </p>
 <p>
  As the pages of history show, on January 21, 1924, Comrade Lenin, the great leader of the working class and oppressed peoples all over the world, the second milestone of Marxism-Leninism-Maoism, became immortal leaving a great legacy of incalculable value. The teachings of Comrade Lenin, who transformed the "world of the future", whose foundations were laid by Marx and Engels, and who from an abstract possibility have turned into a concrete reality, are still relevant after a century of great upheavals in the world. To position yourself correctly in the class struggle, this "current affairs" and orientars of its direction must be taken.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lenin as a master of communism that broke the ice and paved the way against the international reaction and revisionism
 </p>
 <p>
  Correctly identifying contradictions in the history of class struggle, grasping moments of breakage in history and being ready in these moments of breakage was the main task of the entire struggle of partner Lenin until its immortality. After the death of Marx and Engels, for a long time the opportunism of the second international had taken on the leadership of the international proletariat, an interval that in Stalin's words was "a period during which the parties of the second international were not able to continue to conduct the theoretical struggle to free the international proletariat and the oppressed peoples of the world by the influence of these opportunists and class collaborators of social-democrats. Otre to the theoretical struggle for the liberation of the international proletariat and oppressed peoples, with the foundation of the communist international he developed a form of organization and struggle appropriate to the dynamics of the class struggle in the new phase of capitalism ".
 </p>
 <p>
  Comrade Lenin has transformed the Communist Party and the Communist International into a war instrument against the bourgeoisie by freeing the Communist Party and the movement of the Communist Internazionale from the hindrances of the legal forms of struggle: "Instead of a revolutionary policy, smidulized philistism e Breast politicianism, parliamentary diplomacy and parliamentary combinations. To save the appearances, of course, "revolutionary" resolutions and words were approved, but to pass them to the archives (...) it was necessary to review all the work of the II International, all its working method, ban on philistyism, Mental stenten, politicantism, the repudiation of Marxism, social scores, socialpacifis. It was necessary to verify all the arsenal of the II International, throw away everything there was rusty and antiquated, forge new sorts of weapons. Without this preliminary work it was useless to start at war against capitalism. Without this work, the proletariat risked being, faced with the new revolutionary battles, insufficiently armed, or even completely unarmed. The honor of this general revision, of this general cleaning of the wishes of Augìa of the International II was touched on Leninism ". (Fundamentals of Leninism, Stalin)
 </p>
 <p>
  Comrade Lenin, with his genius, understood what the core of the contradiction was and has caught that the fight against the bourgeoisie cannot be sufficiently effective and winning without shaking off the weight that weighs on the shoulders of the international proletariat, without fighting the 'opportunism and revisionism, without showing the masses the true character of these visions both from a theoretical point of view and from a practical point of view, without isolating such ideas as much as possible. By establishing the necessary and dialectical connection between "internal struggle" and "external struggle", Comrade Lenin has carried out a double struggle.
 </p>
 <p>
  Comrade Lenin left us communists the extremely important lesson on the inseparability of the fight against revisionism and opportunism from the fight against imperialism and all forms of the dominant reaction. The fight against imperialism must be purged by revisionism and opportunism.
 </p>
 <p>
  Keep Lenin's teachings high within the deepest contradictions of the imperialist system
 </p>
 <p>
  The imperialist system, which his partner Lenin analyzed in detail at the beginning of the twentieth century, survived until the present day, but his contradictions are welcoming and has entered a spiral of insoluble antagonistic contradictions. Although the dissolution of the USSR and the integration process in the capitalist system of China has crossed, making contradictions did not explode for a while, the law of the unequal development of capitalism continues to advance and the inter-imperialist rivalry develops until the Stadium of the "disintegration" through regional wars. This shows the crisis in which the system is currently located and that the "solutions" proposed in the past no longer work in the current phase. The imperialists, who for a long time have maintained the crisis by downloading the weight of the system on the semi-colonies and plundering its resources have now reached a deadly point.
 </p>
 <p>
  One of the explosive nodes of the problems inherent in the imperialist system, which developed according to the definition of imperialism of Lenin, is that the inter-imperialist struggle, which has manifested itself in various forms in recent years, is currently fought through regional wars. When Lenin enumerates the contradictions of imperialism, he cites inter-imperialist contradiction as one of the three most important contradictions.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We can see that the developments are in line with the observations of Comrade Lenin on the characteristics and contradictions of imperialism: the second contradiction is the contradiction between the different financial groups and the different imperialist powers in their struggle for the sources of raw materials e for the territories of others. Imperialism is the export of capital to the sources of raw materials, struggle fierce for the exclusive possession of these sources, struggle for a new division of the world already divided, a struggle that is conducted with particular harshness, from new financial groups and from the powers in Try to "place in the sun", against the old groups and the powers that do not want to abandon the booty at any cost. This fierce struggle between different groups of capitalists is noteworthy because it contains, as an inevitable element, the imperialist wars, the wars for the conquest of other people's territories. This circumstance, in turn, is noteworthy because it leads to the mutual weakening of the imperialists, to the weakening of the positions of capitalism in general, because it brings the moment of the proletarian revolution closer, because it makes this revolution practically necessary ". (Stalin, principles of Leninism).
 </p>
 <p>
  Russia and China, the former socialist countries who gave the imperialist system a truce with their new markets, have become among the main actors of inter-imperialist rivalry, in dispute with the hegemonic power of the United States. This means that the scope and nature of contradictions have increased with the growing involvement of new and powerful actors in the struggle for the redistribution of the territories. The great confrontation with the invasion of Russian imperialism in Ukraine took place in this context. It is foreseeable that this trend will deepen and spread further. Until there is a direct comparison between the imperialists, the areas where the division wars will be fought will be semi-colonies and colonies. The semi-colonies and the oppressed peoples of the world will continue to pay the price of these wars until the imperialists are declared direct war.
 </p>
 <p>
  With this, the division of the world into a handful of imperialist nations and a majority of oppressed countries- masterfully analyzed by Lenin- has been deepened even more. The third contradiction takes care of the robbery and the imperialist looting, and the semi-colonial and semi-feudal rise in powerful national liberation wars and popular wars that shake the imperialist system.
 </p>
 <p>
  Parallel to the process in which imperialism is passing under the inter-imperialist contradictions, and the imperialist countries in contradiction, the peoples and the oppressed nations; All parts of the dominant system, especially the imperialist states, are becoming more centralized, militarist and belligerent than before, paving the way for all fascist feelings to bring society to a corresponding ideological configuration. This is achieved both with the so -called extreme right, and under the veil of social democratic or liberal parties. The Communists and the oppressed peoples of the world, in the face of the reality of a system that becomes more reactionary and aggressive every day, need a Leninist party to guide the struggle of the proletariat for political power, as outlined by his partner Lenin, to organize one Strong resistance against this reaction. Only such a party, today Marxist-Leninist-Maoist, can lead an irreconcilable struggle against the bourgeoisie.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lenin's great legacy, the Leninist conception of the party: the major staff of the proletariat
 </p>
 <p>
  “Revolution is not a gala lunch, it is not a literary party, it is not a drawing or embroidery, it cannot be done with so much elegance, with such serenity and delicacy, with so much grace and courtesy, the revolution is an act of violence in which one class overturns the other ". (Mao Zedong)
 </p>
 <p>
  It is crucial as the communists define existing contradictions and how they position themselves in the face of developments. In the hundred years spent from the death of Comrade Lenin, the imperialists have transformed their government structures into even larger war machines. Their armies, police, secret services etc. They are equipped with skills incomparable to those of the past. On the other hand, a considerable part of those who call themselves "communists" or "revolutionaries" ignore this reality (even if it seems theoretically accepted) and are far from positioning themselves in agreement with it. However, following an ideological and practical reconciliation line that blocks the working class and the oppressed masses in the dominant system, they dampen the anger of the masses and act as dams. While the imperialists and the dominant structures of exploitation are equipped with increasingly violent devices and institutions, it is necessary, as followers of Comrade Lenin, to conduct a strong ideological struggle against the fact that those who define themselves as "revolutionaries" and "communists" yes They move more and more from the reality that the revolution and the revolutionary struggle will be based on weapons and violence. Taking the implacable struggle of Comrade Lenin against the opportunism of the International II as a guide against these opinions is one of the important tasks to do justice to Comrade Lenin in the centenary year of his immortality.
 </p>
 <p>
  Comrade Lenin defined the new type of communist party as "the proletariat's war organization". This definition was necessary due to the imperialist system and the mutual position of the classes. Both the process that led to the October revolution and the civil war that broke out with the October Revolution were the concrete reasons for why Comrade Lenin called the Communist Party "War organization of the proletariat". The Communist Party, which will lead the emancipation of the proletariat and the oppressed masses, must have this characteristic, while the counter -revolution is arm itself from top to bottom with the apparatus and means of violence and is committing all these terrible massacres against the working class and oppressed peoples. A revolutionary war needs a fighter party to do it. Only the fools and incorrigible revisionists who rely on the bourgeoisie can see it differently.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some people ridicule us as supporters of the "omnipotence of war". Yes, we are supporters of the omnipotence of the revolutionary war; This is good, not bad, it is Marxist. The weapons of the Russian Communist Party created socialism. We will create a democratic republic. The experience of the class struggle in the era of imperialism teaches us that only with the power of the rifle the working class and the working masses can defeat the armed bourgeoisie and the landowners; In this sense we can say that only with weapons can the whole world be transformed. (Mao Zedong)
 </p>
 <p>
  In its foundation conference, the LCI defined the construction and reconstitution of communist parties as an important task in the struggle for the world proletarian revolution. The understanding of the Communist Party developed by his partner Mao Zedong is in line with the understanding of the Communist Party outlined by his partner Lenin, and also enriched by Stalin, and is the realization of the Leninist understanding of the party in the ideology of Marxism-Leninism-Maoism. In the period of imperialism and the proletarian revolutions in which we are, the Communist Party capable of opposing the growing aggression of the imperialist reaction and to conduct the proletariat and the oppressed peoples of the world to liberation must have the quality of a "war organization of the proletariat ".
 </p>
 <p>
  An essential legacy of Lenin is the question of political power as a fundamental question of every revolution. Lenin showed how "the proletarian revolution is impossible without the violent destruction of the bourgeois state machine and without its replacement with a new" and as "everything except power is an illusion". Under Lenin's personal guidance, the first socialist state in the world, the dictatorship of the proletariat was established, which materialized the proletarian path towards power and to keep it.
 </p>
 <p>
  After Lenin's death, it was his continuator Stalin who brilliantly defined Leninism, who developed it further and to make the basis of the entire international communist movement. Based on the shoulders of the great Lenin, President Mao was able to bring the world proletarian revolution to higher levels and to develop the ideology of the proletariat. The Leninism that today is Marxism-Leninism-Maoism must be embraced, defended and applied to the current situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Like LCI, we will continue to carry out the tasks raised by the great Lenin and we will make good use of the inheritance that his partner Lenin left us.
 </p>
 <p>
  Comrade Lenin, the great master of the international proletariat and Marxism Leninism-Maoism, guides and guides our struggle for the world proletarian revolution today as yesterday!
 </p>
 <p>
  Live Il Marxismo-Leninism-Maoism!
 </p>
 <p>
  Long live the international proletariat!
