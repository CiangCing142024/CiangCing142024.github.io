    The Indian Federation of 
 Water transport workers, which represents more than 3500 
 workers of the 11 main ports of the country, has decided to refuse 
 to load or download loads of weapons from Israel, so 
 As from any other country that can move armed loads 
 from Israel or military equipment and its allied load 
 for the war in Palestine.
   </p>
   <p>
    We port workers, who are part of the unions, there 
 We will always oppose the war and the killing of innocent people such as 
 Women and children.
   </p>
   <p>
    Killing of innocent people like women and children: the recent 
 Attack of Israel in Gaza who threw thousands of Palestinians in 
 an immense suffering and loss. Women and children were made to 
 pieces during the war, the parents were unable to recognize theirs 
 children killed due to the bombings.
    <br/>
    At this moment our 
 union members collectively decided to refuse to 
 Moving all types of armed loads.
   </p>
   <p>
    The loading and unloading of these weapons helps to provide the ability to kill innocent people.
    <br/>
    Therefore, we, port workers and Indian ports of various large ones 
 active ports in the load handling sector, we ask that 
  Anyone who refuses to move all types of armed loads.
   </p>
   <p>
    We ask our members not to move more ships who transport military material to Palestine/Israel.
   </p>
   <p>
    We therefore also ask for an immediate ceasefire. As unions 
 We declare our solidarity with those who fight for peace. 
  We appeal to the workers of the world and to the people who love the 
 peace to support the request for a free Palestine.
