After this operation, the total number of looted weapons that are unaccounted for is about 4,000.

   Churachandpur
  </a>
  , where on Thursday night there were two dead people and dozens of injured people in marches of the people towards the police station. The protesters denounced that a Kuki local policeman has been fired for collaborating with armed groups, but when the same happened with Meitei agents, nothing happened. The protesters have pointed out the complicity of the local repressive forces with the Meitei militias. The protest was harshly repressed and inhabitants of Churachandpur recorded how the Indian repressive forces attacked the mobilization, being similar to being in a war zone, with shooting with lethal ammunition and using explosives against the protesters.

  When the old Indian State announces that it has pacified the situation or that “it has returned to normalcy,” then the conflict erupts in many other places. The reality is that Manipur has not been pacified and will not be pacified soon. The situation is still not controlled despite the large number of troops deployed there, which is

  . Even the Prime Minister of Manipur, N Biren Singh constantly urges the State repressive forces to act more firmly. But from May, all this has been insufficient for stopping the protests and the struggle of the people in Manipur.
