   We express our total solidarity towards students e 
  of the students of the Liceo Severi Currenti in Milan, who in the morning 
 of 30 January they occupied their institute to report the genocide 
 in place in Palestine and against indifference to the deaths of dozens of 
 Thousands of people under Israeli bombs.

   Starting from the alleged 70,000 euros of damages following the employment, the Minister of Education
   <a>
   </a>
   Valditara, 
  rushed to visit the institute, he decided to grasp the ball at 
 leap, coming to declare even that it would be: 
 “... a military, guerrilla action. Here are several crimes committed, 
  In addition to the interruption of public service there is damage e 
 private violence ". It is actually a matter of hitting students and 
 students with actions never seen before, so as to try to bury

  </a>
  definitively employment and self -management practices in schools, 
 historically put in place by the student movements to express the 
 own dissent. The government, as announced by Minister Valditara, 
 already known for his vision of the school as a place where it is necessary 
 humiliate to educate, now wants to launch new rules against employment 
  of educational institutions through a witch hunt for 
 isolate and punish with the rejection who will be held responsible.
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   Wednesday 14 February at 2.00 pm students and students 
 Severi currents made a garrison outside the gates, in 
 concomitance with the interrogations of more than 50 of them. The accusation with the 
  which they are called in front of the entire institute council is 
 that of causing damage to the building during employment. THE 
 boys and girls involved risk being expelled from the institute 
  and to lose the school year.
  </p>
  <p>
   At the very participated garrison, students and students have 
 reiterated with determination that: "During the occupation they are not 
 outlined relationships of strength or power, but each student was able to 
 Live school in an environment of full freedom and self -management. [...] 
 During the occupation it was not participated in a evaluation system, not 
 It was a number, simply was there in learning collectively and 
  even for those who wanted to take a break from all forms of 
 learning, the school has turned into a free, warm place and 
 welcoming every hour of the day and night. ".
  </p>
  <p>
   Furthermore, the need for students of 
 break the silence of the institutions, therefore also of the school, in 
 against the Palestinian cause. Silence that becomes an accomplice of a 
 Government that openly supports Israel. Valditara's action was 
 So double, on the one hand the goal is to always legitimize 
 plus the repressive push towards students and 
 students, on the other hand it is to continue to reiterate that it should not 
 Talk about Palestine.
  </p>
  <p>
   Self -management, self -determination and freedom are the instances 
 actively claimed by students through practice 
 employment, widely shared also in different interventions 
  collectives that have expressed themselves in their solidarity.
  </p>
  <p>
   The garrison was surrounded by dozens of journalists (and not a few 
 policemen) who clearly had the goal of riding the wave 
 of the criminal media scandal implemented by the Minister 
 of education and merit Valditara. The school should not be a 
  laboratory for the repression and criminalization of the struggles, but 
 one of the many places where you can express your critical thinking e 
  one's opposition to liberticide policies, one of the many places in 
  to practice solidarity and not competition. "This is what 
 makes a moment of struggle unique, the interpenetration of several imaginations, 
  which, in a self -managed dimension, are able to place on the plate 
 new ways. All in the direction of the change of the relationships of 
  force ”, concludes the press release of the students who launched the 
 today's garrison.
  </p>
  <p>
   We do it ours: it is therefore necessary to take sides once again 
 with students and students against a school-company model e 
 of school-galera in which we would like to repress any form of autonomy. 
 From the neighborhoods to schools, we defend all employment.
