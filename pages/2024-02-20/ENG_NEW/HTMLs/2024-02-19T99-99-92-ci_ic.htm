  <strong>
   Comrade Lenin, the guide for the international proletariat and is the great teacher of Marx-Lenin-Mao, who illuminates the solidarity for the international communist movement
  </strong>

 <p>
  “
  <strong>
   We meet the army of the great proletariat strategist, the army of Comrade Lenin. Nothing is as noble as the title of Party member of the Party that the founder and leadership is Comrade Lenin. ”
  </strong>
  (Stalin)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Through the history pages, we know that, on January 21, 1924, Comrade Lenin, the great leader of the proletariat and the oppressed peoples in the world, the second great milestone of Marx-Lenin-Mao, has left and leaves great and valuable heritage. The teachings of Comrade Lenin, who has transformed the "future world", with the platform set by Marx and Engels, from a non -realistic ability into a specific reality, still completely suitable after a position. Knight with great fluctuations of the world. In order to have the right attitude in the class struggle, people must accept "reality" and towards it. That "reality" is also a remedy for reformed reformers, reviewers, "fascinated parliamentary", those who surrender and compromise with all kinds of bourgeois thoughts are dominating. It is a guarantee for belief and determination for a communist society.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Lenin - the great teacher of communism, who broke the deadlock and opened the struggle against the revision and international reactionaries
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Identify conflicts in the history of class struggle, grasp the nature of historical failures and be ready for them are the most important points for comrade Lenin until the person leaves. After Marx and Engels died, the right to leaders of the proletariat has fallen into the opportunity in the International Second International, according to Comrade Stalin:
  <strong>
   “A time when the International Second Party's political parties could not absorb the theoretical struggle to liberate the proletariat and the oppressed peoples around the world from the influence of democracy - society. Political opportunities and class compromise. Supplementing the theoretical struggle to liberate the proletariat and oppressed peoples in the world as the birth of the Communist International, it has developed a new form of organization and struggle appropriately. With the motivation for class struggle in the new era of capitalism. ”
  </strong>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Comrade Lenin turned the Communist and International Communist Party into weapons to fight the bourgeoisie by liberating the Communist Party and the Communist International movement from the shackles of legal struggle:
  <strong>
   “There should be a revolutionary policy, it is a weak Philistineism, a vile political trick, a parliamentary commune and parliament tricks. Of course, to keep the face, people have passed the "revolutionary" resolutions and slogans ... "
  </strong>
  Burying that form deep into the drawer, far from the clamping of legal forms of struggle.
 </p>
 <p>
  “
  <strong>
   But a new period, the imperialist war and revolutionary fighting of the proletariat, was approaching. Facing the great power of the financial capitalist, the old struggle methods have been clearly not enough and have no strength anymore.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   It is necessary to reconsider the entire work and working methods of the Second International; Philistine's mind must be excluded, small narrow disease, political tricks, betrayal spirit, socialism, peaceful socialism. It is necessary to check the entire arsenal of the Second International, throw away all that has been rusty and old, forging new weapons. If you do not do that opening work, do not attempt to attack capitalism. Without doing so, the proletariat is at risk of not being fully armed, or even without weapons before new revolutionary battles.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Leninism has been honored to conduct the re -examination and disinfect the Augean cow cows of the Second International.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The method of Leninism has arisen and trained in such conditions. ”
   <br/>
   <br/>
  </strong>
  (Stalin, principles of leninism)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Comrade Lenin, with his genius, grasped the core element of the conflict and realized that the bourgeois struggle could not be effective and successful without the burden on the shoulders. international proletariat, not fight against revisionism and opportunities, do not let the masses see the true nature of these views in theory and practice and not isolate them as far as possible as possible. . By consolidating dialectic and necessary relationships between "internal struggle" and "Foreign Affairs", he has conducted two parallel struggles at the same time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Comrade Lenin has left us, the communists are extremely important that the struggle against the revision and the inseparable opportunity for the struggle against imperialism and the people reactionary top. On the contrary, the fight against the empire must also eliminate the revision and opportunities.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Maintain Lenin's teachings about serious conflicts in the imperialist system
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  The system of imperialist imperialism was detailed by Lenin in the early twentieth century, continued to exist in the past era, but the conflicts inside it became more and more serious and gradually being Falling into the vortex of antagonistic contradictions cannot be resolved. Although the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the process of integration into China's capitalist system have temporarily blocked the explosion of these conflicts, the law of uneven development of privateism. The continuous version and the competition between imperial countries continue to develop to the "disintegration" stage with regional wars. This shows the crisis of the system [imperialist-N.D.] And previous "solutions" are no longer effective. The empires, who maintained the crisis by venting their burdens to the semi -colonial countries as well as intensified the looting of those countries, there was no way.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the explosive points on the inherent issue of the imperialist system that has been developed under the definition of Lenin on imperialism, is the conflict between imperial countries, shown with each other. Different forms in recent years, it is now shown through regional wars. When Lenin lists the contradictions of imperialism, he sees it as one of the three most important types of contradictions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  We can see those progress is suitable for the observations of Comrade Lenin about the nature and conflicts of imperialism:
  <strong>
   “The second conflict is the conflict between financial groups and imperialist powers struggling to win raw materials, to win other territories. Imperialism is capital export to places where raw materials, a crazy struggle to monopolize those sources of raw materials, is the struggle to divide the world that has been divided, the struggle Especially fierce of new financial groups and powers are looking for a "sun in the sun", against the old financial and powerful groups trying to cling to what they have seized. The characteristics of that crazy struggle between capitalist groups, is that it includes the inevitable element, that is, the imperialist wars, the wars to appropriate territories. other country. This situation is characterized by the empire to weaken each other, causing the status of capitalism in general to weaken, causing the proletariat revolution to quickly broke out, causing it That revolution became inevitable. ”
  </strong>
  (Stalin, the principles of Leninism).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russia and China, countries that used to be socialism have created a postponed time for the empire of their new markets, have become the main factors in the competition between the empire countries. , scrambling for the hegemony with the United States. This means that the level and nature of the contradictions have increased with the increasing participation from emerging and powerful forces in the struggle to redistribute the territory. The big deal with the invasion of the Russian Empire with Ukraine is taking place in that context. It can be seen that this trend will be deeper and spread stronger. As long as there is no direct confrontation between the empire countries, the wars will continue to be promoted in colonial and semi -colonial countries. The semi -colonial countries and oppressed peoples around the world will continue to pay for these wars until the empires declare each other directly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World division
  <em>
   became imperial countries and oppressed countries accounted for the vast majority in the world
  </em>
  - Intimate analyzed by Lenin - has been further expressed. The third conflict has become more serious with the looting of the empires and the rise of national liberation wars and strong people's wars in the semi -colonial and semi -feudal countries. vibrating the imperialist system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In parallel with the mode of operation of imperialism, it is operated by conflicts between empire countries and conflicts between empire countries and oppressed nations and peoples; All parts of the ruling system are increasingly concentrated, militarized and aggressive than before, paving the way for the rise of fascist thought, conspiracy to bring society into an ideological pattern for ideological patterns for ideology. rule. This is done by the so -called extremely righteous thought or under the curtain of Democratic - Social and Free Party parties. Communists and oppressed peoples in the world face the reality of an increasingly reactionary and aggressive system, need to have a Leninist political leader to lead the struggle of the class. Properties to gain political power, as Mr. Lenin outlined, to conduct strong counterattacks against this trend. Only one political party, today is the Marxist-Leninist-Maiist Party itself, can lead a non-air-conditioning struggle with the bourgeoisie.

 <p>
  <strong>
   Lenin's great heritage, a Leninist political party; Battle Staff of the proletariat
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  “
  <strong>
   The revolution is not a party, not a literary writing, not a flower embroidery painting, it is impossible to be elegant, leisurely, polite and polite, unable to be peaceful, gentle Good, respectable, reserved and humble. The revolution is violence, the fierce act of one class to destroy the class. ”
  </strong>
  (Mao Zedong).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is important that the communists must identify how conflicts and identify their status before development. One hundred years since the death of Comrade Lenin, the empires turned their ruling system into a giant war machine. The army, police, secret agents, etc. were much more terrible than before. On the other hand, there are a number of people who claim to be "communist" or "revolutionary" worrying ignoring reality (even if they accept it theoretically), and those people still still have long time ago. However, the way of reconciliation in terms of thought and practice has tightened the proletariat and the masses were oppressed into the ruling system, calming the anger of the masses and acting as a dike. Wave shield. While the empires and their exploitation systems are equipping themselves more violent machines and institutions than ever before, that is necessary, because those who follow the path of Comrade Lenin will progress. Accompanying a strong ideological struggle against the truth is that those who claim to be "revolutionaries" and "communists" are increasingly far from reality that the revolution and revolutionary struggle will be based on the dance. Trang and violence. Taking the relentless struggle of comrade Lenin against the opportunity of the Second International is the way to enlighten the struggle against the above views is one of the important tasks to perform justice. Give Lenin's comrade to celebrate the 100th anniversary of his death.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Comrade Lenin defined a new type of communist party to be "the battle team of the proletariat". This definition is essential due to the imperial system and the general position of the class. The process led to the October Revolution and the civil war broke out along with the revolution were the specific reasons that Lenin called the Communist Party as "the battle team of the proletariat". It is a necessity for a Communist Party, the political party leading the struggle to liberate the proletariat and the oppressed masses, in the context of the anti -revolutionaries, which are being armed from the top to the top. With violent machines to carry out terrible massacre in the proletariat and oppressed peoples. It is necessary to have a fighting party to promote the revolutionary war. Only ignorant people and the reviewers do not know how to repair them based on the bourgeoisie to see the problem.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strong>
   "Someone laughed at us as the" universal war theory ". Yes, we are universal war theory, which is not bad but good, is Marxist. The gun of the Russian Communist Party has created a socialist country. We must create a Democratic Republic. The experience of class struggle in the empire of the imperialism shows that, only by the power of the gun, the working class and the labor mass will win the bourgeoisie and the landlords dancing. page ; With that meaning, we can say, only guns can change the world. ”
  </strong>
  (Mao Zedong).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the establishment conference, the International Communist Federation determined that the construction and re -establishment of the Communist Party was an important task in the international proletariat struggle. The concept of the Communist Party developed by Mr. Mao Zedong is in line with the concept of the Communist Party outlined by Comrade Lenin, enriched by Stalin and realized the concept of Leninist about the Party in the ideological system of Marx-Lenin-Maoism. In the era of imperialism and the proletariat revolution, where we find ourselves, the Communist Party wants to be able to withstand the increasing war of invasion of the reactionaries and leadership. The proletariat and oppressed peoples around the world come to the liberation, the Communist Party must be "the battle team of the proletariat".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lenin's weak heritage is a political power issue as a basic issue of every revolution. Lenin pointed out that "
  <strong>
   The proletariat revolution could not be done without a violence against the bourgeois state apparatus and replaced it with a new form of state ”.
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   "Everything, except for power is just a bunch of illusions."
  </strong>
  . Under the leadership of Lenin, the first socialist state in the world, the first proletarian dictatorship was born, concretized and maintained the path to the power of the proletariat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After Lenin died, his successor, Stalin defined Leninism excellently, developed and turned it into a foundation for the international communist movement. Stepping shoulder to shoulder with Lenin, President Mao brought the international proletariat to the peak and developed the idea of the proletariat to a higher step. Marx-Lenin-Maoism, ie Leninism of today's era, must be supported, protected and applied.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Our International Communist Federation will continue to perform well the tasks that Lenin has set and promote the heritage that he has left for us.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Comrade Lenin, the great teacher of the proletariat and Marx-Lenin-Mao, the leader and illuminated the path for the international proletariat struggle today. old!
