   We have received reports on political graffiti being made in the capital of India, New Delhi in support of the New Democratic Revolution and demanding the release of revolutionary political prisoners associated with it.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  The comrades who sent this information to us wrote the following: In February 2024, large-scale wall writing appeared in Delhi in support of New Democratic Revolution in India. Delhi, as the capital of the old Indian state and the centre of white power, is the stronghold of the ruling comprador bureaucratic bourgeoisie and the landlord classes. Even in the belly of the beast and the urban centre of reaction, the spark of New Democratic revolution continues to burn in symphony with the people’s war in the countryside, even under times of of utmost reactionary violence against the masses, charged by brahmanical Hindutva fascism of the Indian state.

  Wall writing demanding the releases of Pramod Mishra and Hem Mishra. Pramod Mishra is a Politburo and Central Committee member of Communist Party of India (Maoist). He was previously a member of the erstwhile Maoist Communist Centre of India (MCCI) and led large-scale land struggles in the state of Bihar after the death of MCCI leader com. Kanhai Chatterjee. Mishra was in-charge of Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, Jammu and Kashmir after MCCI merged with CPI ML (People’s War) to form CPI (Maoist) in 2004. Even the American imperialists took note of him during this period and featured him in their Country Reports on Terrorism in 2006. He was arrested by the Indian state in 2008 but was acquitted and released in 2017. He was re-arrested in August 2023. Hem Mishra, a student of Chinese language in Jawaharlal Nehru University, was a popular cultural activist with Revolutionary Cultural Front (RCF) in Delhi. His activism raised awareness of the Indian state’s genocidal war on people in Bastar, particularly against the Adivasi peasants, the imperialist resource loot of India’s natural resources as well as the semi-feudal violence prevalent in Indian society. He was arrested in 2013 under the charges of being a “courier” for Maoists and remains incarcerated.

  Wall writing against the Indian state’s counter-revolutionary Operation SAMADHAN-Prahar initiated in 2017 against the CPI (Maoist) and the People’s Liberation Guerrilla Army (PLGA) which also oversaw genocidal policies against the Adivasi peasants in resource-rich regions of India. The counter-revolutionary operation grew into the Surajkund Offensive in 2022, after the Indian state decided to intensify its Chiang Kai-shek-style encirclement campaign against the guerrilla zone. Just like the erstwhile Operation Green Hunt, SAMADHAN-Prahar and the Surajkund Offensive will be defeated by the Indian masses, its vanguard the CPI (Maoist) under the banner of Marxism-Leninism-Maoism.
