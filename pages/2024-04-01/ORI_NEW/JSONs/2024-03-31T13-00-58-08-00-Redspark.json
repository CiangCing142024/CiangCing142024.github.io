Valbuena, honored the Red fighters and leaders of the Party as heroes and martyrs of the Filipino people\u2019s revolution for national and social liberation.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In Batangas, three Red fighters were martyred in a firefight in Barangay Elvita (Tubahan), Rosario last March 26. Killed were Junalice \u201cKa Arya\u201d Arante-Isita, Bernardo \u201cKa Mamay/Mike\u201d Bagaas and Erickson \u201cKa Ricky/Vale\u201d Cueto. Arante-Isita, 37, served as a leading cadre of the revolutionary movement in Batangas and was a member of the Regional Committee of the CPP in Southern Tagalog.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In Quezon, two beloved warriors of the people were killed in an encounter in Guinayangan town last March 28. Martyred were Divine Sureta (Ka Zoe), who hailed from the indigenous Manide tribe, and Paul Cruz (Ka Isko), who at the time of his death was a member of the CPP\u2019s Quezon Provincial Committee.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \u201cTheir deaths are huge losses to the Party, the NPA and the masses whom they wholeheartedly served,\u201d Valbuena said. \u201cTheir sterling examples in struggle and ultimate sacrifice, however, serve as inspiration for more people to take the hard path of waging armed struggle.\u201d\n </p>\n <p>\n  \u201cEven now, more and more young people are joining the NPA as they see the necessity and justness of waging revolutionary armed struggle against the puppet, corrupt, and fascist Marcos regime,\u201d Valbuena added.\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   Source : https://philippinerevolution.nu/statements/cpp-honors-fallen-npa-fighters-in-batangas-quezon/\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n</div>", "source": "https://www.redspark.nu/en/peoples-war/cpp-honors-npa-fighters-killed-in-recent-skirmishes-in-batangas-and-quezon/", "type": "article", "title": "CPP Honors NPA Fighters Killed In Recent Skirmishes In Batangas And Quezon - Redspark", "description": "CPP Information Bureau | Communist Party Of The Philippines March 31, 2024 The Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) today", "modified time": "2024-03-31T17:41:03+00:00", "author": ["Alan Warsaw"], "categories": ["People's War", "Philippines"], "tags": ["Antifascism", "Barangay Elvita", "Batangas City", "Batangas Province", "Bernardo \u201cKa Mamay/Mike\u201d Bagaas", "communist party of the philippines", "CPP", "CPP-NPA-NDF", "CPP-NPA-NDFP", "Dictatorship of Marcos", "Divine Sureta (Ka Zoe)", "Erickson \u201cKa Ricky/Vale\u201d Cueto", "Fascism", "Ferdinand \u201cBongbong\u201d Marcos Jr", "Ferdinand Marcos Jr.", "Information Bureau of the CPP", "Junalice \u201cKa Arya\u201d Arante-Isita", "Marco L.
