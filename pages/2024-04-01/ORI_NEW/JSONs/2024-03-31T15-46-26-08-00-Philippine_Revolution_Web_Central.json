For the past 55 years our Red fighters \nhave fought the people's enemy with courage and honor. \nThey are the beloved warriors of the masses. We salute \ntheir valor, render the highest honor and tribute to the \nrevolu\ufffdonary martyrs and heroes of the New People\u2019s \nArmy, and offer our deepest gra\ufffdtude for the sacrifices \nthey have given to triumph against the enemy.\nThe enemy always aims to destroy the revolu\ufffdonary \nmovement and halt the surge of people\u2019s struggle. But \nno coercive instrument of the state, no ma\ufffder how brutal \nand fascis\ufffdc, can stop the people from figh\ufffdng for a new \nsocial system. It is the brutal violence and intolerable \nburden of exploita\ufffdon and oppression by the comprador \nbig bourgeoisie, landlords and monopoly capitalists that \ndrive the masses to persist in the struggle. \nThe greed of foreign and domes\ufffdc capitalists \ndehumanizes the workers, peasants and all toiling \nmasses. The violence of exploita\ufffdon and oppression \nagainst the masses that persists day a\ufffder day, and the \ncriminal disregard for their abject poverty legi\ufffdmize the \njustness of the people\u2019s war and thus must be supported. \nThe Filipino people commit themselves to armed \nrevolu\ufffdon not because they glorify wars. They commit \nto it because they understand that it is only through armed struggle that their aspira\ufffdons for a just, \ndeveloped, and progressive society will be fulfilled. \nFor more than five decades, the revolu\ufffdonaries and the \nmasses have withstood the onslaughts of the enemy. The \nhardships and sacrifices of the Filipino people and their \narmy have built a strong founda\ufffdon for the advance of \nthe na\ufffdonal democra\ufffdc revolu\ufffdon and the crea\ufffdon of \nthe People\u2019s Democra\ufffdc Government.  \nImperialism and the local reac\ufffdonaries may seem like a \nformidable foe. But we have the people on the side of \nrevolu\ufffdon and once aroused, organized, and mobilized \nin their millions, they become an invincible force. It is the \nresponsibility of the revolu\ufffdonary movement to \ncon\ufffdnue arousing, organizing and mobilizing the people \nwherever they are. \nDespite the huge number of the enemy forces, weaponry \nand heavy support from US imperialism, the \nrevolu\ufffdonary movement has been able to counter and \ndefeat every strategic counterrevolu\ufffdonary plan \nimplemented by the regimes from Marcos Sr to Duterte. \nThe current Marcos Jr. regime's \u201coplans\u201d will suffer the \nsame fate.\nThe par\ufffdcipa\ufffdon and support of the masses for the \nrevolu\ufffdon are unwavering. Addi\ufffdonally, the \nrevolu\ufffdonary forces abroad, including Filipino migrants, \n\n\n3are greatly inspired by the sacrifices of the New People\u2019s \nArmy. Many have expressed their desire to fight \nalongside the people\u2019s warriors. \nIndubitably, the boundless courage and daringness of \nthe masses and revolu\ufffdonary forces in the face of \nsharpening class contradic\ufffdons shall be kept in the \ntreasure chest of stories that inspire the revolu\ufffdonary \nmovement\u2019s con\ufffdnued advance.   \nRec\ufffdfica\ufffdon and Resurgence\nBuilding on its achievements and founded on the strong \nsupport of the figh\ufffdng masses, the Party has embarked \non a rec\ufffdfica\ufffdon movement to address its weaknesses \nand errors and advance the people\u2019s war to even greater \nheights. This rec\ufffdfica\ufffdon movement strengthens and \nunites the Party and the people along the correct \nrevolu\ufffdonary line and steels the figh\ufffdng will and \ncapabili\ufffdes of the masses and the people\u2019s army to face \nthe enemy. History has shown that revolu\ufffdon advances \nwhen rec\ufffdfica\ufffdon is undertaken to correct errors and \nimplement tasks to further advance the people\u2019s war, \nand to prevent devia\ufffdons from the principles of \nMarxism-Leninism-Maoism that guide the people\u2019s \ndemocra\ufffdc revolu\ufffdon. \nResurgence in all aspects of work for the revolu\ufffdon \nresults from the rec\ufffdfica\ufffdon by the revolu\ufffdonary \nmovement. Analyzing and summing-up our work, \ncorrec\ufffdng errors and pu\ufffdng stress on what must \nimmediately be done will energize comrades to fulfill \ntheir responsibili\ufffdes and tasks. \nPeople\u2019s war is a necessary undertaking in the building \nof the People\u2019s Democra\ufffdc Government that responds \nto the needs of the masses. The old social order must be \ndestroyed in order to build upon its rubble and ashes a \njust, equitable, and pro-people system of governance. \nOurs is a just war and the people\u2019s war of the Filipino \npeople is bound for victory!IN THIS ISSUE\nEditorial: Victory is the only outcome of the \nepic people\u2019s war! |Page 2\nTactical Offensives | Page 4\nA woman\u2019s place is in the struggle | Page 6\nNew attempt at \u201cCha-Cha\u201d exposes GRP's \nrotten political and economic system | Page 7\nPeople\u2019s War Not Constitutional Change is \nthe True Answer to the Filipino People\u2019s \nProblems | Page 9\nMarcos Jr. and Duterte stumble further \ntowards international isolation | Page 10\nCreating freedom and writing the future for \nour children | Page 12\nKa Joma Lives!

The enemy is like a big monster\nthat cannot protect its body parts \nand is bleeding to death from many wounds.\u201d\n\u2014 Jose Maria Sison, 2021\n\u201cPoli\ufffdcal power grows out of the barrel of a gun.\u201d\n\u2014 Mao Tse Tung, 1927\nIn 2023, the New People\u2019s Army (NPA) launched \nnumerous victorious tac\ufffdcal offensives causing the \nfascist enemy to bleed with a thousand cuts. \nRecently, the Narciso Antazo Aramil Command of NPA \n- Rizal successfully ambushed the opera\ufffdng troops of \nthe 80th IBPA in Lukutang Malaki, Barangay San Isidro, \nRodriguez, Rizal. More tac\ufffdcal offensives are certainly \nin the offing. \nHow does the NPA, thus, prepare for a tac\ufffdcal offensive? \nLibera\ufffdon Interna\ufffdonal, on the occasion of the New \nPeople\u2019s Army\u2019s 55th anniversary, interviewed a Red \nfighter to delve into the process of moun\ufffdng an \noffensive. \nPre-tac\ufffdcal offensive\nBefore any tac\ufffdcal offensive (TO) is launched, it is \nme\ufffdculously planned wherein several crucial elements \nare primarily taken into account, such as poli\ufffdcal gain, \nthe masses\u2019 gain, social inves\ufffdga\ufffdon and class analysis \nand the masses\u2019 readiness.\nBased on these considera\ufffdons, the responsible \ncommand determines which kind of offensive befits the \nmasses\u2019 and the NPA\u2019s capaci\ufffdes, exis\ufffdng poli\ufffdcal \nsitua\ufffdon and other security aspects. \nA tac\ufffdcal offensive takes months to prepare, depending \non the size of an opera\ufffdon. For instance, big, annihila\ufffdve \noffensives entail a longer prepara\ufffdon as it involves \norienta\ufffdon and consolida\ufffdon of forces, stockpiling, and \niden\ufffdfying areas to retreat, to name a few. When it \ncomes to small ac\ufffdons, a \u2018window of opportunity\u2019, for \nexample, the enemy passes by an area at a given \ufffdme, \nprompts swi\ufffd prepara\ufffdons. It also depends on the masses. Their determina\ufffdon and \nasser\ufffdon can contribute to a swi\ufffder prepara\ufffdon. More \nimportantly, without the masses\u2019 unwavering support, \nthere would never be a successful tac\ufffdcal offensive. \nThey play a pivotal role in the en\ufffdre process\u2014from \npreparing the place, determining the places to retreat, \nensuring sufficient food and supply, inves\ufffdga\ufffdng the \nsecurity situa\ufffdon, and monitoring the movement of the \nenemy, to knowing when to strike. \nIn carrying out all these tasks, the people\u2019s mili\ufffda units, \nwho act as local NPA units in the barrio, along with the \nself-defense units of revolu\ufffdonary mass organiza\ufffdons \nare also mobilized. \nActual tac\ufffdcal offensive\nIn all tac\ufffdcal offensives, every Red fighter deals with a \nlot of tension and a lot of things play in their minds which \nis but natural. The NPA though knows how to handle the \nsitua\ufffdon well. They li\ufffd each other\u2019s morale, and keep \nthemselves focused on their objec\ufffdve. \nDuring the actual tac\ufffdcal offensive, a great deal of \ufffdme \nis spent lying in wait, which can last up to three days or \neven longer. \nOnce the opera\ufffdon is mounted, two things can \nhappen\u2014 either it is successful or not. OffensivesTacticalOffensives\nBy Raya Andres - Monta\u00f1osa\n\n\n\nPrimarily, a successful TO is measured by the extent of \ndamage inflicted on the enemy or the enemy\u2019s reduced \nfigh\ufffdng capability. The impact on the enemy is, thus, \nmore important than the sheer number of enemy \ncasual\ufffdes. T o illustrate, it is successful if a sizable number \nof arms are seized from the enemy or if they lose their \nmorale, even if it is a minor tac\ufffdcal offensive, yielding \nminimal or zero enemy casual\ufffdes.  \nContrarily, the effect is the opposite if it is not successful. \nIf this happens (and in any situa\ufffdon), the most important \nthing to do is to assess the results to form an objec\ufffdve \nanalysis of the circumstances and to draw lessons. Also, \nit is important to make the masses understand the \nlessons from their own experiences, regardless of the \nresults of a tac\ufffdcal offensive.\nAbor\ufffdng or stopping a tac\ufffdcal offensive can also \nhappen. One of the main reasons is the extent of harm \nto the masses and the NPA. This usually happens when \nthe social inves\ufffdga\ufffdon is incomplete, or the analysis of \nthe data gathered is wrong. Hence, the importance of \nconduc\ufffdng a thorough study and analysis to collect \ninforma\ufffdon on the enemy\u2019s movements, their stop \npoints, the right \ufffdme to strike them and their \nvulnerabili\ufffdes, among others.\nPost-tac\ufffdcal offensive\nWhen a tac\ufffdcal offensive is successful, the masses \ncertainly celebrate it. O\ufffden\ufffdmes, even the masses who \nlive far from the revolu\ufffdonary mass base are delighted \nupon hearing such successes. Resounding and victorious \ntac\ufffdcal offensives have beneficial effects both on the \norganized and non-organized masses. Whether an NPA opera\ufffdon is successful or not, enemy \nretalia\ufffdon is always expected. If they can no longer \npursue the retrea\ufffdng NPA, they are likely to retaliate \nagainst the masses. Even in the preparatory stage, the \nNPA and the masses prepare for retalia\ufffdon by ensuring \nthat the masses are ready to face the enemy\u2019s threats, \nin\ufffdmida\ufffdon, and harassment. In the areas where there \nare organs of poli\ufffdcal power, revolu\ufffdonary mass \norganiza\ufffdons prepare for these retaliatory ac\ufffdons \nthrough role-playing. Under any circumstances, the \nmasses must realize that safeguarding each other and \nrefusing any a\ufffdempt to separate them from their \ncommunity is vital to protec\ufffdng every one of them.  \nAs for the NPA, the most important thing to do during \nthe retreat is to get the masses\u2019 intelligence reports on \nenemy movements. It is paramount to know, for \ninstance, the enemy\u2019s entry point. If the enemy enters \nthe area, the masses communicate this to the NPA \nimmediately. \nSome\ufffdmes, when the NPA retreats a\ufffder a bigger \noffensive, there is a team that stays behind to delay or \ndeliver another heavy blow to the enemy. The enemy, \nwho usually retaliates to exact revenge, is most \nvulnerable during this \ufffdme. \nThe masses are again ac\ufffdvely involved in this process. \nA\ufffder a tac\ufffdcal offensive, the masses know that the red \nfighters are \ufffdred and hungry. So, they carry their things \nand keep safe the materials and some arms that are used \nfor the opera\ufffdon, as well as prepare and serve them \nfood. Next to giving intelligence reports, they also get \nrid of any trace of NPA presence during the retreat to \nprevent the enemy from loca\ufffdng the NPA.\n\n\n\n6place is in the Strugglewoman'sA\nOn the occasion of the Interna\ufffdonal Working \nWomen\u2019s Day on March 8 and the 55th anniversary of \nthe New People\u2019s Army, Libera\ufffdon Interna\ufffdonal offers \nwomen Red fighters\u2019 insights on building a \nrevolu\ufffdonary family in the context of waging an armed \nrevolu\ufffdon.\nKa M: \u201cAs a mother, I try to a\ufffdend to my child\u2019s needs \nwhile fulfilling my du\ufffdes as a Red fighter. At the same \n\ufffdme, we give our full trust to the masses to ensure the \nsafety of our children and that their needs are met.\u201d\n\u201cAs partners, my husband and I are assigned to \ndifferent guerilla units located far away from each \nother most of the \ufffdme. Thus, we make sure that our \nrequests for visits and reunions are put forward to our \nrespec\ufffdve collec\ufffdves in a \ufffdmely manner.\u201d\nKa Mabini: \u201cFirst of all, it must be recognized that \nsociety puts a heavy pressure on women, especially \nmothers, that they must be responsible for their \nchildren. Especially among the ranks of Red fighters, we \nmust overcome this preconceived no\ufffdon dictated by \nsociety that the woman, the mother is confined only to \nreproduc\ufffdve roles. In this sense, it is important to \nunderstand that the woman\u2019s place is in the struggle. \nFor a Red fighter, it is not only your own child\u2019s welfare \nthat counts when it comes to decision-making. As an \nNPA and Party member, we serve the revolu\ufffdon to \nsecure the future not only of our own children but for \nPhilippine society as a whole. Most of the \ufffdme, we \ncannot be with our children, who are usually taken care \nof by the masses since we are in the midst of a people\u2019s \nwar.\nAny NPA member has the right to have a family, but it \nis important to put this in the context of waging a \nrevolu\ufffdon. This means that we are in the context of \nwar where the NPA\u2019s duty as well as the welfare of the \nParty and the en\ufffdre revolu\ufffdonary movement prevail \nover and guide the process of raising a revolu\ufffdonary \nfamily.\u201d\n\n\n\n7\nBy Jose Emilio Jacinto III\nAnother a\ufffdempt to change the 1987 GRP cons\ufffdtu\ufffdon \n(charter change or cha-cha) is currently underway and \nhas been triggering unrest among the people and within \nthe ro\ufffden ruling system. \nCha-cha's have been a\ufffdempted by every GRP regime \na\ufffder Cory Aquino. The 1987 Cons\ufffdtu\ufffdon was framed \nprecisely to prevent another Marcos dictatorship (the \nGRP president is limited to  one six-year term). Despite \nits reac\ufffdonary character, the 1987 GRP Cons\ufffdtu\ufffdon has \na clear commitment to patrio\ufffdsm and social jus\ufffdce, and \nit declared the Philippines nuclear-free.\nThese a\ufffdempts followed the same script and ended in \nfailure because of the preeminence of the selfish poli\ufffdcal \nobjec\ufffdves of those holding power to perpetuate \nthemselves.\nThe move to change the cons\ufffdtu\ufffdon began a few weeks \nago in early January 2024, when a nondescript YouTube \nvideo was posted poking fun at the 1986 \u201cEDSA people \npower revolu\ufffdon,\u201d which ousted the fascist dictator \nFerdinand Marcos, father of Ferdinand Marcos Jr.\nA so-called people's ini\ufffda\ufffdve started a week later, \ncollec\ufffdng signatures from the barrios and communi\ufffdes \nto amend certain provisions in the 1987 cons\ufffdtu\ufffdon, \nwhich cha-cha proponents blame as the cause of the \ncountry's underdevelopment. A people's ini\ufffda\ufffdve is a scheme that purportedly allows Filipinos to directly \npropose amendments to the Cons\ufffdtu\ufffdon, without \nrequiring congressional ac\ufffdon. \nA joint House and Senate resolu\ufffdon has been filed to \nform both chambers into a cons\ufffdtuent assembly to \namend several ar\ufffdcles in the GRP cons\ufffdtu\ufffdon allowing \nforeigners full ownership of public u\ufffdli\ufffdes, educa\ufffdonal \nins\ufffdtu\ufffdons, and adver\ufffdsing, among others.\nHowever, progressive people's organiza\ufffdons, poli\ufffdcal \nopposi\ufffdon, and the church have argued and stood \nstrongly against cha-cha's revival. They assert that far \nfrom being the solu\ufffdon to the Philippines\u2019 \nunderdevelopment, it is in fact being railroaded to \nextend the term limit of Ferdinand Marcos Jr.\nAccording to Bagong Alyansang Makabayan (Bayan), this \nrevival of cha-cha is no different from the a\ufffdempts of \nprevious regimes to use it for their selfish poli\ufffdcal \nambi\ufffdons. The cha-cha revival is in fact ini\ufffdated by \nMarcos Jr.'s cousin, Speaker of the House of \nRepresenta\ufffdves Mar\ufffdn Romualdez, who reportedly \nspent Php20M per district (about USD350,000) to buy \nthe signatures of the people. The Philippines has around \n253 congressional districts.\nBayan argues that apart from its ul\ufffdmate goal of \nremoving term limits of elected officials, cha-cha will New attempt at \u201cCha-Cha\u201d \nexposes GRP's rotten political \nand economic system\n\n\n8further open the economy to foreign plunder and \nexploita\ufffdon and the return of permanent US military \nbases in the Philippines. According to Bayan, this is the \nreason why the US is also behind the Marcos Jr. \ngovernment in this ini\ufffda\ufffdve.\nBlaming the 1987 cons\ufffdtu\ufffdon for the roots of the \ncountry's problems is covering-up the reality of \nunbridled bureaucra\ufffdc corrup\ufffdon, feudal and \nsemifeudal exploita\ufffdon and imperialist control of the \npoli\ufffdcal and economic system of the country, Bayan \nemphasizes. \nThe GRP has been consistent in covering up these \nproblems when talking peace with the revolu\ufffdonary \nmovement and blaming the armed resistance as the \ncause of the country's poverty and underdevelopment. \nIt has tried to trip the revolu\ufffdonary movement to \nsurrender to the GRP cons\ufffdtu\ufffdon. In fact, the cha-cha \na\ufffdempts show that the GRP wants to mu\ufffdlate its own \ncons\ufffdtu\ufffdon.\nDuring the 38th anniversary of the EDSA uprising, \nthousands marched in the Philippines and overseas to \nprotest Marcos Jr.\u2019s scheme to change the charter. They \norganized a broad network opposed to changing the \n1987 Cons\ufffdtu\ufffdon, which bans poli\ufffdcal dynas\ufffdes, sets \nterm limits for public officials and provides other guarantees to ensure that the state has \u201cchecks and \nbalances,\u201d  and prohibits 100% foreign ownership of \nland, key infrastructure, strategic industries and facili\ufffdes \nin the Philippines.\nThe broad opposi\ufffdon network against cha-cha also \nasserted that instead of focusing on wrecking the \ncons\ufffdtu\ufffdon, the GRP should address the people\u2019s \ndemands for wage increases, lower prices, and be\ufffder \nsocial services.\nThey also called for resolving the anomalous 2022 \nelec\ufffdons which installed Marcos Jr. and Duterte.\nAs the Marcos Jr. regime remains determined to push \nfor cha-cha despite the failures of previous a\ufffdempts and \namidst the Filipino people's resistance, the people's \nmilitant democra\ufffdc movement and its poli\ufffdcal allies \nmust intensify their vigilance in opposing and figh\ufffdng \nfurther moves of the regime to perpetuate itself in power \nand allow further imperialist intrusion into the country's \neconomy and poli\ufffdcs. \nThis current push for cha-cha has only exposed the ruling \nbureaucrat capitalists\u2019 drive to perpetuate themselves \nin power, further sell the country's sovereignty and \nintegrity to imperialists, and desecrate the people's \nfundamental rights and freedoms.\n\n\n\n9COMPATRIOTS-NDF, the revolu\ufffdonary \norganiza\ufffdon of Filipinos overseas and a \nmember of the Na\ufffdonal Democra\ufffdc Front of \nthe Philippines (NDFP), believes that the \nPhilippine Cons\ufffdtu\ufffdon is a worthless piece of \npaper that legi\ufffdmizes and jus\ufffdfies oppression \nand exploita\ufffdon of the Filipino people in a \nsemicolonial, semifeudal society ruled by US \nimperialism, bureaucrat capitalism and \nfeudalism. \nAll Cons\ufffdtu\ufffdons (1934 and 1943) that had \nbeen in effect since the United States\u2019 crea\ufffdon \nof a so-called Philippine Commonwealth, then \nfollowed by the Philippine Republic, were \nimposed on the Filipino people to legi\ufffdmize its \nneocolonial rule. The 1973 Cons\ufffdtu\ufffdon or \nMarcos Cons\ufffdtu\ufffdon, which replaced the pre-\nWWII cons\ufffdtu\ufffdons, made President Ferdinand \nMarcos Sr. a one-man ruler. The cons\ufffdtu\ufffdon \nthat Marcos implemented made him a dictator \nand allowed him to stay in power longer \nthrough the declara\ufffdon of Mar\ufffdal Law.\nThe Filipino people\u2019s an\ufffd-dictatorship struggle \nled to the ouster of Marcos in 1986, paving the \nway for the Corazon Aquino government and its \n1987 Cons\ufffdtu\ufffdon, which included some \nfavorable provisions such as the ban on nuclear \nand foreign military bases, limi\ufffdng foreign \nownership to 40%, an\ufffd-poli\ufffdcal dynasty and \nterm limits for elected officials including the \npresident. These provisions had been the \nsubject of many devious a\ufffdempts by previous \npuppet regimes to amend them. \nMarcos Jr. and his allies in his ruling class \nfac\ufffdon are behind the moves to revise the \n1987 Cons\ufffdtu\ufffdon. He aims to \ufffdnker with this \npiece of paper with changes that will enthrone \nhis family and cronies once more in perpetuity while ensuring the support of US imperialism by \nallowing the la\ufffder and its allies to plunder our \nresources and complete the annexa\ufffdon of the \nPhilippine archipelago as its military base in the \nlooming inter-imperialist shoo\ufffdng war with \nChina.\nThe oppressed and exploited classes and \nsectors of the Philippine society have all the \nreasons to oppose Marcos Jr.\u2019s Charter Change. \nCompatriots-NDF believes that the people\u2019s \nopposi\ufffdon against Charter Change is growing \nand will succeed as it is linked and raised to the \nan\ufffd-imperialist, an\ufffd-bureaucrat capitalist, and \nan\ufffd-fascist struggle. \nWe call on the Filipino People to expose and \noppose the Marcos Jr. Regime as US \nimperialism\u2019s new tyrant at the helm of the \npuppet government of the Philippines. Any \nchanges to the current 1987 Cons\ufffdtu\ufffdon of \nthe Republic of the Philippines only aim to \nconsolidate and perpetuate the power of the \nruling classes of bourgeois compradors, big \nlandlords, and the bureaucrat capitalist state, \nand favor the con\ufffdnued plunder and war-\nmongering agenda of its US imperialist master. \nNo amendment to the current neocolonial \nCons\ufffdtu\ufffdon will provide relief or salva\ufffdon to \nthe Filipino masses from poverty, des\ufffdtu\ufffdon, \nand oppression. The Filipino people\u2019s na\ufffdonal \ndemocra\ufffdc revolu\ufffdon is the only and true \nsolu\ufffdon to the fundamental economic, poli\ufffdcal, \nand socio-cultural problems of the Filipino \npeople. \nOnward with the People\u2019s War! \nDefeat Imperialism! \nAdvance the People\u2019s Democra\ufffdc Revolu\ufffdon!\nPeople\u2019s War Not Constitutional Change \nis the True Answer to the Filipino \nPeople\u2019s Problems\nStatement of COMPATRIOTS-NDF\n(Revolu\ufffdonary Organiza\ufffdon of Overseas Filipinos and Families)\n\n\nMarcos Jr. and Duterte stumble \nfurther towards international \nisolation\n\n\n\u201cseemingly unchecked powers\u201d due to the An\ufffd-T error \nAct, which was passed into law during Duterte\u2019s \ufffdme. \nThe UN experts expressed \u201cserious concern about the \nseemingly broad and unchecked execu\ufffdve \npowers\u2026par\ufffdcularly the discre\ufffdon of the An\ufffd-T errorism \nCouncil to designate individuals and organiza\ufffdons as \n\u2018terrorists\u2019 and the An\ufffd-Money Laundering Council to \nadopt targeted financial sanc\ufffdons therea\ufffder.\u201d \nThe le\ufffder was signed by Fionnuala Ni Aolain, special \nrapporteur on human rights while countering terrorism; \nIrene Khan, special rapporteur on the promo\ufffdon and \nprotec\ufffdon of the right to freedom of opinion and \nexpression; Clement Nyaletsossi Voule, special \nrapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful \nassembly and of associa\ufffdon; Mary Lawlor, special \nrapporteur on the situa\ufffdon of human rights defenders; \nJos\u00e9 Francisco Cali Tzay, special rapporteur on the rights \nof indigenous peoples; and Nazila Ghanea, special \nrapporteur on freedom of religion or belief.\nIn July 2023, the Interna\ufffdonal Criminal Court (ICC) \nrejected an a\ufffdempt by the Duterte camp to block an \ninves\ufffdga\ufffdon into the thousands killed during Duterte\u2019s \nso-called \u2018war on drugs.\u2019 Following the ICC\u2019s \nannouncement, Marcos Jr. stated that his regime would \nnot cooperate with the ICC inves\ufffdga\ufffdons claiming the \ninterna\ufffdonal court has no jurisdic\ufffdon in the Philippines. By refusing to cooperate with the ICC,  Marcos Jr. lays \nbare his culpability in shielding the Duterte regime\u2019s \nreign of state terror that killed 30,000 people and \nvic\ufffdmized the Filipino toiling masses for six long years.\nIt can be recalled that this series of diploma\ufffdc incidents \nhounding the reac\ufffdonary regime was preceded by a \nfalling out between the Marcos Jr. and Duterte ruling \nfac\ufffdons. First triggered by conflict over the bureaucra\ufffdc \nloot in the controversial \u2018confiden\ufffdal funds\u2019 of the Office \nof the Vice President (OVP) Sara Duterte (daughter of \nRodrigo Duterte), the feud between the two ruling \ncliques has developed into exple\ufffdve-laden exchanges. \nEarlier this year, Rodrigo Duterte called out Marcos Jr. \nfor plo\ufffdng to amend the cons\ufffdtu\ufffdon to li\ufffd the \npresident\u2019s term limits. He also accused Marcos Jr. of \nbeing a drug addict. In turn, Marcos Jr. responded by \nsaying Duterte was fond of using fentanyl, a powerful \nopioid drug. \nThe worsening crisis of the semicolonial and semifeudal \nsystem in the Philippines has not only sharpened the \ncontradic\ufffdons between the Marcos Jr. and Duterte \nruling cliques but has also intensified the people\u2019s \nresistance against neoliberal offensives and increasing \nfascism  by the current regime. The unprecedented level \nof crisis and repression unfolding is only bound to worsen \nMarcos Jr. and Duterte\u2019s isola\ufffdon from the Filipino \nmasses and from the interna\ufffdonal community.\n\n\n\n12\nCREATING FREEDOM \nAND WRITING THE \nFUTURE FOR OUR \nCHILDREN An interview with\nDahoud Shebab, Spokesperson of the \nIslamic Jihad in Gaza\nby the Liberation staff \nThrough the help of friends from the interna\ufffdonal media, the \nLibera\ufffdon staff was able to send a set of ques\ufffdons to the Pales\ufffdnian \nresistance movement based in Gaza. The ques\ufffdons focused on the \nreasons why the October 7 military ac\ufffdon against Israeli forces was \nlaunched, the unity of various groups and forces in Pales\ufffdne, the vision \nof a free Pales\ufffdne, and the lessons the world could learn from the \nPales\ufffdnians as they wage their war of libera\ufffdon and self-\ndetermina\ufffdon. \nThe Islamic Jihad is among the various groups within the Pales\ufffdnian \nForces Alliance, which includes Hamas, Popular Front for the \nLibera\ufffdon of Pales\ufffdne, Popular Struggle Front, Pales\ufffdnian Libera\ufffdon \nFront, Vanguard for the Popular Libera\ufffdon War-Ligh\ufffdng Forces, and \nthe Fatah Al-In\ufffdfada Movement. \n\n\n13Below is the transcript and transla\ufffdon of the video interview with Dahoud Shebab. \nMinor copy edi\ufffdng was done for this print version.      \nLibera\ufffdon: What was the immediate trigger of the October 7 a\ufffdack against the Israeli \ngovernment? Is there a strategic goal behind this?\nDahoud Shebab (DS):  October 7 was an expression of the angry Pales\ufffdnian \nrejec\ufffdon of all forms of repression and terrorism by Israel over many years against \nthe Pales\ufffdnian people. October 7 is not isolated from the rest of the Pales\ufffdnian \nresistance before October 7.\nWe must say that the Pales\ufffdnian resistance is about defending its land and \ndefending its people. The resistance is not a group of killers and killing in itself is \nnot the goal. It is not to cause a state of destruc\ufffdon and ruins. Rather, it seeks to \npressure the occupa\ufffdon and use legi\ufffdmate means to raise its voice to the world \nand deliver its message, especially in the light of Israel's complete denial of the \nrights of the Pales\ufffdnian people and the con\ufffdnued Israeli a\ufffdacks on the Al-Aqsa \nMosque, Jerusalem, the West Bank; Israel's con\ufffdnuous viola\ufffdons of prisoners' \nrights; and the con\ufffdnuing siege of the Gaza Strip. All these were done by Israel \nwithout anyone in the world doing anything to stop them.\nWe have been warning and sending messages to mediators, all par\ufffdes, and the \nUnited Na\ufffdons that Israeli policies will lead to a major escala\ufffdon and an explosion \nof the situa\ufffdon. Before, we witnessed great aggression by Israel. There was killing \nof Pales\ufffdnians at checkpoints in the West Bank in cold blood. Every day there were \nvic\ufffdms. Did anyone look at those vic\ufffdms? No. No one looked. \nCame October 7. The aim was to tell Israel and send a message to the whole world \nthat the Pales\ufffdnian resistance can cause instability if Israel con\ufffdnues its terrorism \nand aggression; and that it is not only the Pales\ufffdnian people who will pay the price \nfor Israel's crimes. Se\ufffdlers, the whole region and the whole world may pay the \nprice. All stability will be undermined if Israel con\ufffdnues its a\ufffdacks.\nL: Did you an\ufffdcipate Israel\u2019s counter-a\ufffdack to be in this magnitude? \nDS: We are aware that Israel is a brutal, bloody and criminal state, especially this \nextremist government. We know what they can do. But we did not know that the \nIsraeli government does not care about its prisoners and soldiers in the Gaza Strip. \nThat it can even resort to killing them if only to ensure that this leadership or the \nIsraeli fascist government achieves poli\ufffdcal and electoral gains in its internal \ncompe\ufffd\ufffdons. Israel has even ignored the humanitarian calls made by the \nPales\ufffdnian resistance since day one of this ba\ufffdle for the release of civilian \nprisoners or civilian detainees for humanitarian reasons.\nWe have said this and called for it. Hamas has also called for it. However, Israel \nhas not paid a\ufffden\ufffdon and has con\ufffdnued to carry out criminal and bloody bombing \nand destruc\ufffdon that has made vic\ufffdms even of Israeli civilians and foreign \nna\ufffdonali\ufffdes. Israel did not care at all for its civilian prisoners, not even the military \npersonnel in the hands of the Pales\ufffdnian resistance.\nIndiscriminate and destruc\ufffdve shelling occurred whether there were Israeli \nprisoners, foreign na\ufffdonals, or others. En\ufffdre neighborhoods were exterminated \nwith its residents, civilians, or prisoners held by the Pales\ufffdnian resistance. Israel \nshowed no respect even for minimum humanitarian and moral values in the Gaza \nStrip, especially in the areas of Gaza governorate and in northern Gaza.\nL: What is the vision of a free Pales\ufffdne? What do you intend to do with Israeli residents \nwho were already born and residing in Israel for so long?\nDS: To be clear, all this land is for Pales\ufffdnians and like any country in the world, \nwhen we take full rights and sovereignty over our land, then the government \nchosen by the Pales\ufffdnian people can decide how to deal with foreign expatriates, \nwhether Jews or non-Jews.\nWe have no problem with Jews; we have no problem with anyone. Our problem \nis with Israeli Zionists who occupied our land. We have posi\ufffdve and good rela\ufffdons \n\n\n14with many Jews in the world. They never believe in occupa\ufffdon. They reject the \noccupa\ufffdon. We have no problem with them.\nThe problem is with Israeli Zionists who came and occupied our land and \nestablished a state on our land. Now when we take the right to our land and be \nliberated, we can choose our own government. This government, like any \ngovernment in the world, can decide on these na\ufffdonals: grant them na\ufffdonali\ufffdes \nor not grant them.\nThe problem is that Israel is the occupier. We, therefore, treat the Israeli people \nas occupying our land. They are all occupiers, but upon our libera\ufffdon, we will \ndecide on it. Like any country in the world, you decide on it. \nThis ma\ufffder applies to different countries of the world as well. Also, why is it \npermissible for a group of countries, such as NATO member states, to establish \nan alliance with each other and have joint defense agreement but other \ncountries could not?  This is a natural right that Pales\ufffdne exercises when it, too, \nhas entered an alliance with other countries such as Iran, Yemen, Iraq, Lebanon, \nand other countries or other powers, to support the cause of the Pales\ufffdnian \npeople.\nL: An alliance of different resistance movements is now formed, are there other \npoli\ufffdcal forces working at a different direc\ufffdon? How was this unity achieved? \nDS: We welcome any party that wants to support us as Pales\ufffdnians and we will \nnot stand against it. But it is important that there is no interference in our \npolicies and in our method of work. That is, no one should intervene. The \nPales\ufffdnian resistance has independent posi\ufffdons and are not linked to any \nforeign agendas as claimed by the Israeli occupa\ufffdon and other countries that \nsupport it. We aim to achieve a more comprehensive Pales\ufffdnian unity.\nToday, we are more confident than ever before in our ability to achieve internal \nPales\ufffdnian reconcilia\ufffdon. The great plight of the Pales\ufffdnian people today as a \nresult of the Israeli aggression requires building true unity, especially as some \ncountries are trying to interfere in our affairs and imposing the form and method \nof managing ourselves. We know how to manage ourselves and know how to \ndecide our des\ufffdny. We will never accept interference from any external party.\nOur Arab brothers have many things in common. We all are in consensus on \nwhat things may be like in the coming days, and we will not allow Israel to impose \non us the form, administra\ufffdon, and method of governance in the next phase.\nL: What could possibly threaten this unity?\nDS: Israel is the constant threat to Pales\ufffdnian unity.\nIsrael, which kills the sons of Fatah, the sons of Hamas, the Islamic Jihad, the \nPFLP (Popular Front for the Libera\ufffdon of Pales\ufffdne) and the DFLP (Democra\ufffdc \nFront for the Libera\ufffdon of Pales\ufffdne-Marxist Leninist organiza\ufffdon) and kills all \nthe Pales\ufffdnian people in the West Bank. Israel is the most serious threat to \ninternal Pales\ufffdnian unity. It has always been a major obstacle to achieving \nPales\ufffdnian unity. \nToday, everyone is fully aware that there is no future for a se\ufffdlement with Israel \nand that Israel is a bloody, criminal, and terrorist en\ufffdty. In the long term, we \nbelieve that this convic\ufffdon will promote greater efforts to overcome internal \npoli\ufffdcal differences and lead to building a true Pales\ufffdnian unity created by the \nPales\ufffdnians.\nThis is a right exercised by all occupied na\ufffdons and subjected to aggression but \nwon their independence at the end. There is no occupa\ufffdon that lasts forever, \nnot in all human history. We seek our freedom.\nTherefore, our vision is despite all Israeli threats our resistance will be further \nstrengthened. Israel will not be able to end the resistance, because as long as \nthere is an occupa\ufffdon, the resistance will remain. This is a natural thing, and we \nare confident that we are closer to victory.\n\n\n15L: The struggle of the Pales\ufffdnians is now at the center \nstage of the world, gathering millions of supporters. \nWould you consider this a poli\ufffdcal victory? \nDS: The whole world today is looking at the \nPales\ufffdnian people, the injus\ufffdce done to them and \nthe need for the Pales\ufffdnian people to exercise their \nrights. We are commi\ufffded to use all our rights \nthroughout our land. This is what we hope to \nachieve. \nToday, there is a great deal of empathy and support \nfor the Pales\ufffdnian people, including Arabs, \nforeigners and people of all races and ethnici\ufffdes. \nThere is great sympathy for the Pales\ufffdnian cause. \nThere is great support for the right of the \nPales\ufffdnian people to resist, regardless of the \nposi\ufffdons of the colonial countries. \nWe do not expect anything from Britain, for \nexample, or the Bri\ufffdsh government. Britain is \nknown to be a colonizing country. France is a \ncolonizing country. The United States of America is \nthe main sponsor of all the chaos that prevails in the \nworld. It created chaos in Iraq, in Afghanistan, in \nPakistan and in other countries. The American \nexperiments\u2014even when America wanted to create \ngovernments in its own mold\u2014failed miserably and \nput these countries into misery, and their future \nbecame sorry and uncertain. \nL: Having demonstrated the higher unity and capacity \nfor waging this war of libera\ufffdon, what are the \nprospects now?\nDS: People always create their freedom with their \nown hands. Today, the Pales\ufffdnian people have \ndecided to create their freedom and write the future \nof their children by their own hands.\nWe defend the future of our children in future \ngenera\ufffdons. They should live a decent, safe and \nstable life like other peoples of the world. But to remain under siege and suffer the injus\ufffdce \nprac\ufffdced against us by Israel, and to remain hostage \nto the policies of starva\ufffdon and killing -- all of this \nmust stop. \nYes, today we are making great sacrifices. But these \nsacrifices will be a light of hope for a real bright \nfuture for the next genera\ufffdons. \nToday, the world faces the test of whether to be \nloyal and honest with itself, and to take sides with \nthese values and principles, which were the result \nof a great deal of wars and bloody, deadly and \ndestruc\ufffdve conflicts.\nL: What is your take on the role of Israel\u2019s allies and \nsupporters?\nDS: We must see the United States of America for \nwhat it really is. It is not a civiliza\ufffdon, it has not \ncreated civiliza\ufffdon, it has not created stability, but \ninstead has created ways for itself to dominate the \nwhole world. Today is the \ufffdme for the world to be \nfree from American domina\ufffdon, from slavery to the \nUS dollar, and for the world to take sides with \njus\ufffdce.\nThere can be no jus\ufffdce in the light of the con\ufffdnued \noccupa\ufffdon of the land of Pales\ufffdne, the occupa\ufffdon \nof the Pales\ufffdnian people, and the con\ufffdnued \nsuffering of the Pales\ufffdnian people among the other \npeoples of the world who are also suffering as a \nresult of American and Western colonial policies.\nThe whole world is a vic\ufffdm of the policies of Europe \nand America's colonial policies. They plundered the \nworld's wealth, destroyed the environment, \ndestroyed the world economy, and dominated \npoli\ufffdcal affairs.\nToday, there is a true awakening in many countries \nand peoples in the world, and must be strengthened \nand must con\ufffdnue.\n\n\n\n16Kamil \u201cKa Alex\u201d Manangan was raised in a pe\ufffdy-\nbourgeoise upbringing and a na\ufffdve of Punta, Sta. \nAna, Manila. She studied Business Administra\ufffdon at \nthe Polytechnic University of the Philippines (PUP) \nwhere she ac\ufffdvely par\ufffdcipated in a young women \nstudents\u2019 organiza\ufffdon and engaged in poli\ufffdcal work \namong her fellow students.\nDuring her organizing work in the urban area, Ka \nAlex quickly realized the necessity of the na\ufffdonal \ndemocra\ufffdc revolu\ufffdon and understood that armed \nstruggle was the only means to fully liberate \nPhilippine society. \nShe was among the many young revolu\ufffdonaries \nwho responded to the call of the Third Rec\ufffdfica\ufffdon \nMovement for the youth to join the armed \nrevolu\ufffdon in the countryside. A\ufffder a\ufffdending the \nParty\u2019s anniversary celebra\ufffdon in Batangas in 2016, \nshe decided to stay in the New People\u2019s Army for \nsix months a\ufffder which she  commi\ufffded to becoming \na full-\ufffdme Red fighter under the NPA-Batangas \nEduardo Dagli Command. \nDue to her excep\ufffdonal skills, Ka Alex quickly rose \nthrough the ranks and became a poli\ufffdcal guide \nwithin her unit. She par\ufffdcipated in military \nopera\ufffdons, including a raid on Henry Sy\u2019s security \nforces in Pico De Loro resort in Batangas. She \ndisguised herself as an officer from the Department \nof Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) and \nserved as a lookout. Ka Alex was happy and proud \nto have been part of this historic puni\ufffdve opera\ufffdon \nagainst the Sy Family, owners of the Shoemart Malls \nand chain of department stores and one of the \nbiggest comprador bourgeoisie families, who \ngrabbed thousands of hectares of land from the \npeasants in Batangas.\nA\ufffder this breakthrough experience, Ka Alex was \nassigned to do mass work where she served as a \ndeputy poli\ufffdcal instructor for her platoon forma\ufffdon \nin the town of Lian. She led propaganda and mass \neduca\ufffdon work within their area of responsibility. Ka Alex\u2019s city-life upbringing was totally different \nfrom the life of a guerrilla fighter in the countryside. \nYet, she would o\ufffden tell her comrades how all her \nphysical exhaus\ufffdon would suddenly disappear \nwhenever she talked with the masses about their \ndaily lives and hardships. \nHer determina\ufffdon was tested once more in a \ndefensive encounter in Barangay Lumaniag where \nshe and two other Red Fighters, Ka Jessie and Ka \nZac, got separated from their unit. She valiantly \nwithdrew her two wounded comrades and ensured \ntheir safety. Undeterred by their predicament, she \nwent to nearby houses of the masses to seek help. \nShe did not know the masses in the area, but she \nused her propaganda skills and experience in mass \nwork to gain their trust. The masses eventually \ndecided to help them by giving medicine, food, \nlending clothes and providing a phone to contact \nthe others for back up.\nKa Alex once again demonstrated her strength \nwhen the fascist AFP (Armed Forces of the \nPhilippines) troops were closing in on the house \nwhere they were staying. She raised the morale of \nher wounded comrades by singing \u201cTigreng Papel\u201d  \n(Paper Tiger) and repeatedly reci\ufffdng the Party\u2019s \noath: \u201cI pledge\u2026to safeguard the security of the \nParty and all my comrades at the cost of my life if \nnecessary\u2026\u201d \nEven a\ufffder her harrowing experience in the face of \nthe enemy troops, Ka Alex showed no signs of \nretreat or regret. Her experience in the ba\ufffdlefield \nonly further strengthened her determina\ufffdon. \nWhen Ka Alex became a full-\ufffdme Red fighter, she \nwas elected as a member of the Party\u2019s front \ncommi\ufffdee. A\ufffder a few months, she was assigned as \na poli\ufffdcal guide for her squad and later as deputy \npoli\ufffdcal instructor for her platoon and logis\ufffdcs \nofficer for her unit. Throughout her \ufffdme in the NPA, \nshe demonstrated excep\ufffdonal zeal in poli\ufffdcal work \nboth among the people\u2019s army and the masses.\u2018Women who struggle \nare women who can \nnever be defeated\u2019\nRemembering the life of Kamil \u201cKa Alex\u201d Manangan\nby Atan Dominguez\n\n\nKa Alex dedicated her talent and abili\ufffdes to \ndo painstaking mass work and touched the \nlives of hundreds of peasant families in \nBatangas. \nAs an exemplary revolu\ufffdonary woman who \ngave up a comfortable life in the city to be \nwith the masses she vowed to serve, Ka Alex \nwill always be remembered as a hard-\nworking, gentle, and forward-thinking \ncomrade.  She will always be remembered for \nalways quo\ufffdng Mao\u2019s words: \u201cThe women \nwho struggle are the women who can never \nbe defeated.\u201d Ka Alex lived by these words \nun\ufffdl her very last breath. She was martyred \nalongside 13 others on November 28, 2017, \nin an encounter with the mercenary AFP-PNP \ntroops in Nasugbu, Batangas.\nAlthough Ka Alex\u2019s \ufffdme in the people\u2019s army \nmay have been short, her life carries profound \nsignificance for the masses she served. The \nstrength of her commitment and enthusiasm \nfor revolu\ufffdonary work is an eternal source of \ninspira\ufffdon for the youth and women \nrevolu\ufffdonaries who persevere in advancing \nthe people\u2019s war.\n\n\n\n18\nLibera\ufffdon Interna\ufffdonal: The GRP has asserted that any \npossibility of opening the peace nego\ufffda\ufffdons would be a \n\u2018restart\u2019 of the whole process, including the framework of \nthe nego\ufffda\ufffdons. Will the NDFP Peace Panel table this as \na first item (the framework) in ini\ufffdal discussions when both \npanels meet face to face?\nJulie de Lima :  We are not for a \u2018restart\u2019 but for a \nresump\ufffdon of peace nego\ufffda\ufffdons. As the first item when \nwe meet with the GRP team in April, it will be the \ndiscussion on the framework of the peace nego\ufffda\ufffdons.  \nThe Hague Joint Declara\ufffdon as the framework for peace \nnego\ufffda\ufffdons has resulted in several substan\ufffdve \nagreements, the most important of which are the Joint \nAgreement on Safety and Immunity Guarantees (JASIG) \nand the Comprehensive Agreement on the Respect for \nHuman Rights and Interna\ufffdonal Humanitarian Law \n(CARHRIHL).  We cannot consign these to the waste \nbasket. Both the GRP and the NDFP have put in a lot of \npainstaking and deliberate effort in the course of 36 \nyears. Thus, we will insist on discussing the reaffirma\ufffdon \nof all previous signed agreements.\nLI: When the Duterte regime scu\ufffdled the talks in 2017, \nboth panels have been engaged in discussions on the \ncomprehensive agreement on social and economic \nreforms, considered to be the \u201cheart and soul\u201d of the \nnego\ufffda\ufffdons. Has this substan\ufffdal ma\ufffder ever been \nmen\ufffdoned or discussed in framing the statement \nrecognizing the \u201cserious socioeconomic and environmental \nissues\u201d facing the Philippines?\nJL:  I made a brief presenta\ufffdon of the NDFP dra\ufffd CASER \nat a mee\ufffdng with the GRP team in March 2023.  We \nmeant this to be among the serious socioeconomic and \nenvironmental issues facing our country.  But we did not \nhave an in-depth discussion on this with the GRP team.\nLI: This year will be the 26th year since the Comprehensive \nAgreement on the Respect for Human Rights and \nInterna\ufffdonal Humanitarian Law (CARHRIHL) was signed \nby the GRP and the NDFP. In light of recent and con\ufffdnuous \nreports of aerial bombings, killings and massacres against \npeasants, ac\ufffdvists and hors de combat in the Philippine \ncountryside, how can the broad interna\ufffdonal solidarity for the Philippine revolu\ufffdonary movement hold the GRP \naccountable for its war crimes?\nJL:  The current Ferdinand Marcos Jr. regime can be held \naccountable for viola\ufffdons of the CARHRIHL, which the \ngovernment co-signed with the NDFP.  But since these \nacts cons\ufffdtute war crimes, he can also be held to \naccount under the Nuremberg principles. Like Duterte, \nMarcos Jr. can also be charged under the terms of the \nInterna\ufffdonal Criminal Court. Other avenues including \nquasi-legal courts of public opinion can also form the \nbasis of future legal ac\ufffdons to hold Marcos Jr. and \nDuterte for their war crimes.\nLI: What would the NDFP consider as the most \nfundamental and substan\ufffdal item that needs to be \nurgently addressed in its dra\ufffd of the agreement on social \nand economic reforms?\nJL:  The most fundamental items that need discussing \nare agrarian reform, rural development and na\ufffdonal \nindustrializa\ufffdon.  These form the founda\ufffdon of the \nna\ufffdonal economy and are the keys to ending poverty \nand joblessness in the country and ensuring economic \ngrowth.\nLI: GRP factotums have voiced nervous concerns about the \nCPP's current rec\ufffdfica\ufffdon movement, even saying that \nintensifying the people's war runs counter to the \u201cspirit\u201d of \nthe peace nego\ufffda\ufffdons, are there bases for them to have \ncold feet? Would there be implica\ufffdons for the peace talks, \nas they imply?\nJL:  The CPP\u2019s current rec\ufffdfica\ufffdon movement is sure to \nrevitalize and lead to the resurgence of the revolu\ufffdon \nwhich in turn compels the GRP to address the root \ncauses of armed conflict. Of course, the enemies of the \npeople would be concerned about this. \nLI: Should the formal peace talks be convened again soon, \nis the NDFP ready with its peace nego\ufffda\ufffdng panel?\nJL: The GRP has a long track record of undermining the \nNDFP Peace Nego\ufffda\ufffdng Panel by targe\ufffdng NDFP \nconsultants and nego\ufffdators in clear viola\ufffdon of JASIG. HARDTALK: \u2018WE ARE NOT FOR A \n\u2018RESTART\u2019 BUT FOR A RESUMPTION\nOF PEACE NEGOTIATIONS\u2019\nLiberation International interview\nwith Julieta de Lima, Chairperson, NDFP Peace Negotiating Panel\n\n\n19On the second year of the fascist Marcos Jr. regime, the \ntoiling women con\ufffdnue to par\ufffdcipate in the armed and \nunarmed forms of struggle to advance the people\u2019s \nna\ufffdonal democra\ufffdc revolu\ufffdon!\nThe intense oppression and exploita\ufffdon of women in a \nsemicolonial and semifeudal society strengthen and \nexpand the membership of revolu\ufffdonary mass \norganiza\ufffdons such the Makabayang Kilusan ng Bagong \nKababaihan (Patrio\ufffdc Movement of New Women-\nMAKIBAKA).\nMajority of women belong to the poorest strata of \nsociety, workers, farmers, indigenous and urban poor. \nS\ufffdll to recover from the widespread loss of jobs, falling \nincomes, and inflated prices of goods and u\ufffdli\ufffdes caused \nby the pandemic, the Marcos Jr. regime intensifies \nwomen\u2019s impoverishment through the con\ufffdnued \nimplementa\ufffdon of neoliberal agreements and policies.\nMarcos Jr.\u2019s subservience to his US imperialist master is \nblatant in the form of US-directed changes to the \ncountry\u2019s economic policies. In his current a\ufffdempt to \namend the 1987 Cons\ufffdtu\ufffdon via Charter Change, \nMarcos Jr. further opens the country\u2019s economy to \nforeign investments in favor of imperialist profiteering.Decades of neoliberal policies implemented in the \nPhilippines have not resulted in any material \ndevelopment for the people and for the economy.  \nInstead, trade deficits persist and the country\u2019s economy \nis constantly dependent on remi\ufffdances from overseas \nworkers and from constant foreign borrowing. In the \npast two years alone, the administra\ufffdon has incurred \nPhp1.82 trillion debt. In 2023, debt levels have reached \na total of Php14.62 trillion. Women and the rest of the \nmasses will surely bear the burden of paying these debts \nfor genera\ufffdons to come.\nBecause the country\u2019s economy is \ufffded to the global \ncapitalist system, the crisis of imperialism has a direct \nimpact on the jobs and livelihood of the Filipino people. \nAs the crisis intensifies, so does the capitalist \nexploita\ufffdon of the masses. The three biggest apparel \nmanufacturers that comprise 60% of the country\u2019s total \ngarment exports implemented mass layoffs between \n2019-2024 wherein an es\ufffdmated 80,000 women \nworkers lost their jobs. This was a\ufffder the capitalists \nissued a pull-out order from the Philippines and transfer \nproduc\ufffdon to other countries such as Vietnam and \nCambodia where labor is much cheaper.\nThe severe exploita\ufffdon of the working-class Filipina \ncon\ufffdnues due to contractualiza\ufffdon, various forms of Statement of Makabayang Kilusan ng Bagong \nKababaihan (MAKIBAKA)  on International \nWorking Women\u2019s Day, March 8, 2024Nevertheless, I expect that the Nego\ufffda\ufffdng Panel would \nbe completed as soon as the formal peace nego\ufffda\ufffdons \nstart.\nLI: How do you foresee the conduct of the peace \nnego\ufffda\ufffdons in an\ufffdcipa\ufffdon that most GRP panel \nrepresenta\ufffdves would be coming mostly from the Armed \nForces of the Philippines?\nJL:  We just have to wait and see how they conduct \nthemselves in the peace nego\ufffda\ufffdons.  General Ramos, \na military man, when he became president enabled the \nGRP Nego\ufffda\ufffdng Panel to make progress in the peace \nnego\ufffda\ufffdons.  As a ma\ufffder of fact, the most substan\ufffdve \nagreements were made during his term. Just as it was in \nRamos\u2019 \ufffdme when many substan\ufffdve agreements were \nmade, it was also the military that scu\ufffdled the talks at \nthe \ufffdme of Cory, Gloria, Noynoy and Digong. Therefore, \nit is the seriousness and readiness to engage that the GRP and its principal approach to the peace talks that \nma\ufffders more than the composi\ufffdon of the panel. \nLI: Should the previous agreements already made in the \npast rounds of peace talks be \u2018negated\u2019 , would there s\ufffdll be \nbasis for the NDFP to con\ufffdnue engaging in the \nnego\ufffda\ufffdons?\nJL: It is the responsibility of both par\ufffdes to recognize the \nagreements made during the course of the peace \nnego\ufffda\ufffdons since Cory Aquino\u2019s \ufffdme because these \nagreements were signed by legi\ufffdmate representa\ufffdves \nof both par\ufffdes. Regardless of who is appointed to each \nnego\ufffda\ufffdng panel at whichever point in \ufffdme, the \neffec\ufffdvity of such agreements must be recognized in \norder for the peace nego\ufffda\ufffdons to proceed consistent \nwith the framework provided for by the Hague Joint \nDeclara\ufffdon. Should the GRP disregard these \nagreements, then there would be no point for the NDFP \nto pursue the peace nego\ufffda\ufffdons.\n\n\n\n20labor flexibiliza\ufffdon, low wages, dangerous working \ncondi\ufffdons, discrimina\ufffdon, and violence. The increasing \nnumber of unemployed workers contributes to the \ncrea\ufffdon of a large reserve army of labor that further \ndepresses wages and perpetuates contractualiza\ufffdon. \nThe current minimum wage remains grossly insufficient \nand unlivable especially in the provinces. Minimum wage \nin the Na\ufffdonal Capital Region (NCR) is only Php610 \n(approximately 10USD) while it is only Php316 \n(approximately 6USD) in the Bangsamoro Autonomous \nRegion in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM).\nIn rural areas, women remain among the most \ndisadvantaged groups among fisherfolk, farmers and \nindigenous peoples. For decades, rural women have \nbeen suffering from severe and consistent economic \nlosses and hunger due to widespread landlessness and \nthe lack of state support for local agricultural produc\ufffdon.\nThe reac\ufffdonary state has failed in all of its a\ufffdempts to \nimplement agrarian reform. Since the implementa\ufffdon of \nMasagana \u201899 in 1972 by Marcos Sr., the Comprehensive \nAgrarian Reform Program (CARP) in 1988 by Cory \nAquino, and the subsequent CARP Extension with \nReforms by Arroyo in 2009, the reac\ufffdonary state has \nonly protected the landlords and their haciendas that \nshould have been distributed to the farmers a long \ufffdme \nago. In 2021, there are s\ufffdll 540,000 hectares of \ndistributable land under CARP that have not yet been \ndistributed.\nWidespread neoliberal economic reforms are causing \nwidespread joblessness among farmers and \nfarmworkers. Due to the impacts of liberaliza\ufffdon, highly \nsubsidized foreign agricultural products are flooding the \ncountry resul\ufffdng in losses for small-scale producers. \nThey are instead forced to sell their products at cheaper \nprices, despite the high market prices of rice and other \nbasic food commodi\ufffdes. \nThe emergence of revolu\ufffdonary women's organiza\ufffdons \nin the countryside is caused by the starva\ufffdon of farmers, who are the producers of the people's food. In the \nabsence of agricultural support from the state, coupled \nwith state-sponsored violence, the reac\ufffdonary \ngovernment itself is pushing rural women to par\ufffdcipate \nin armed struggle. \nBecause the feudal-patriarchal society \ufffdes women to \nhousework as the primary caregiver of the family, \nwomen are among the first to be affected by sky-high \ncommodity prices and unlivable wages. Women who \ndemand the right to a living wage and a safe workplace \nare in\ufffdmidated, fired, arrested, and raped. In the \nprovinces, workers are no longer allowed to work in \nnearby factories simply because they are unionized or \nare members of a worker\u2019s associa\ufffdon.\nIn this situa\ufffdon, women's par\ufffdcipa\ufffdon in social and \nna\ufffdonal libera\ufffdon to free themselves con\ufffdnue. The \nsevere economic and poli\ufffdcal crises are pushing them \nto organize fellow women, par\ufffdcipate and lead mass \nstruggles such as in pickets, land occupa\ufffdons and \npeople's strikes, and take the revolu\ufffdonary path of \narmed struggle.\nT ogether with all who are oppressed and exploited, it is \nnecessary for the Filipina women to destroy imperialism, \nbureaucra\ufffdc capitalism, and feudalism so that they can \nall be free.\nHighest tribute to all the revolu\ufffdonary women martyrs \nwho sacrificed their lives for the victory of the people's \nwar!\nLong live MAKIBAKA!\nLong live the na\ufffdonal democra\ufffdc revolu\ufffdon!\nLong live the unity of women and people of the world \nagainst imperialism!\n(This is an abridged version of the original MAKIBAKA \nstatement in Filipino translated to English by Ana Rosario.)\n\n\n\n21\nKA JOMA LIVES! \nSTUDY MOVEMENT: \nIMMORTALIZING \nKA JOMA\u2019S LEGACY \nThe passing of beloved comrade, Ka Jose Maria \nSison, fondly called Ka Joma, on December 16, \n2022, gave birth to a movement that serves to \nimmortalize his legacy and propagate his works and \nteachings to the Philippines and the world. \nLaunched by the revolu\ufffdonary movement in the \nPhilippines and abroad, Ka Joma Lives! is a dynamic \nand vibrant study movement that conducts \ncampaigns and ac\ufffdvi\ufffdes that commemorate his life \nand contribu\ufffdons to the Philippine na\ufffdonal \ndemocra\ufffdc revolu\ufffdon and the world proletarian \nstruggle. \nIn 2023, Ka Joma Lives! Study Movement organized \nthree major webinars, namely: \u201cThe Specific \nCharacteris\ufffdcs of Our People\u2019s War\u201d, \u201cOur Urgent \nTasks\u201d, and \u201cRec\ufffdfy Our Errors, Rebuild the Party!\u201d. \nThese events featured his seminal theore\ufffdcal \nwri\ufffdngs that outline the fundamental principles of \nwaging people\u2019s war, carrying out revolu\ufffdonary \ntasks, and revitalizing the party. \nNext to these webinars, Ka Joma Lives! also \nlaunched ten of his books under the Sison Reader \nSeries last year. These books, a compila\ufffdon of his \nwri\ufffdngs on movements, various sectors, imperialism in domes\ufffdc and interna\ufffdonal se\ufffdngs, \ninterna\ufffdonalism, and rights, jus\ufffdce and peace, are \npublished as Book 12: On the Legal Democra\ufffdc \nMass Movement; Book 13: On the Revolu\ufffdonary \nMovement and Mass Work; Book 14: On the \nWorkers\u2019 Movement; Book 15: On the Peasant \nMovement and Agrarian Revolu\ufffdon; Book 16: On \nthe Youth Movement; Book 17: Women in \nRevolu\ufffdon and Na\ufffdonal Minori\ufffdes and the Right to \nSelf-Determina\ufffdon; Book 18: Imperialism in the \nPhilippines; Book 19: Imperialism in Various Global \nRegions; Book 20: Proletarian Interna\ufffdonalism and \nInterna\ufffdonal Solidarity; and Book 21: People\u2019s \nRights, Jus\ufffdce and Peace.\nRecently, on March 9, Ka Joma Lives! organized a \nback-to-back launch of Ka Joma\u2019s books, also under \nthe Sison Reader Series. En\ufffdtled, Book 22: On \nNeoliberal Globaliza\ufffdon, and Book 23: Intensifying \nInterimperialist Contradic\ufffdons, these books contain \na collec\ufffdon of Ka Joma\u2019s wri\ufffdngs on neoliberalism \nand globaliza\ufffdon, and on the possibility of having an \ninterimperialist war, respec\ufffdvely. \nAside from these ac\ufffdvi\ufffdes, Ka Joma Lives! leads the \ncommemora\ufffdon of Ka Joma\u2019s birth and death \nanniversaries. By Ricardo Lozano and Raya Andres-Monta\u00f1osa\n\n\n22First death anniversary\nOn December 16 last year, on Ka Joma\u2019s first death \nanniversary, Ka Joma Lives! hosted the gathering of \ncomrades, allies, and friends of the revolu\ufffdonary \nmovement in the Philippines at the NDFP \nInterna\ufffdonal Office in Utrecht, the Netherlands to \ncelebrate his colourful and meaningful life. Through \nvarious tributes, songs, poetry readings, and cultural \nperformances, he was honoured and remembered \nalong with several other martyred comrades. \nThis event also launched Ka Joma Lives!\u2019 Poem \nProject. Inspired by Ka Joma\u2019s poem, \u201cStages of My \nLife,\u201d where he chronicled his poli\ufffdcal trajectory \nusing the season metaphor, the project invites \nindividuals to add a new stanza to the poem or \ncreate their version and interpreta\ufffdon as a way of \ncon\ufffdnuing Ka Joma\u2019s legacy.   \nLikewise, in the Philippines, an event en\ufffdtled \n\u201cReflec\ufffdons on Pales\ufffdne, the Philippines, and the \nStruggle for a Just and Las\ufffdng Peace,\u201d was \norganized. Hundreds of individuals, including \nveteran and young ac\ufffdvists, discussed and reflected \non Ka Joma\u2019s life and wri\ufffdngs. They shared their \nthoughts and personal anecdotes on his works, such \nas, \u201cOur Urgent Tasks,\u201d \u201cOn Revolu\ufffdonary \nViolence,\u201d and \u201cThe Filipino People\u2019s Democra\ufffdc \nRevolu\ufffdon is Invincible,\u201d as well as on his thema\ufffdc \nwri\ufffdngs, such as on Israel\u2019s aggressions and \nmassacre of the Pales\ufffdnian people, and peace talks \nbetween the NDFP and the GRP. \nIn the countryside, on the same day, CPP and NPA \nunits also conducted various ac\ufffdvi\ufffdes to honor Ka \nJoma, including the renewal of pledges to the Party. \nVarious guerilla fronts across the country reaffirmed \ntheir wholehearted service to the Filipino people \nand their commitment to offer their lives for the \nvictory of the people\u2019s democra\ufffdc revolu\ufffdon. Ka Joma\u2019s birthday\nThis year, on February 8, Ka Joma Lives! celebrated \nKa Joma\u2019s 85th birthday by organizing a webinar on \nKa Joma\u2019s work, \u201cStand for Socialism Against \nModern Revisionism, and a cultural event in \nUtrecht, highligh\ufffdng Ka Joma\u2019s valuable teachings \non the importance of being steadfast in holding an \nan\ufffd-revisionist line and being diligent in studying \nMLM. The cultural celebra\ufffdon also highlighted the \nCPP\u2019s call for rec\ufffdfica\ufffdon and resurgence, which is \nan ideological call to (re)study the basic Party and \nMLM documents to imbibe the proletarian \nrevolu\ufffdonary a\ufffdtude and style of work fully and \nfirmly, as well as to ac\ufffdvely combat liberalism, \nconserva\ufffdsm and dogma\ufffdsm among other \nideological corrosives that destroy the Party and the \nrevolu\ufffdon.\nHis birthday was also celebrated by the \nrevolu\ufffdonary movement in the Philippines. In a \nstatement, the CPP paid tribute to the con\ufffdnuing \nrelevance of Ka \u201cJoma\u201d and the validity of the \nstruggle for na\ufffdonal democracy. Members of \nKabataang Makabayan, a clandes\ufffdne revolu\ufffdonary \nyouth organiza\ufffdon, in Rizal province, conducted an \n\u2018OP-OD\u201d or opera\ufffdon paint \u2013 opera\ufffdon paste \nac\ufffdvity where they painted a large portrait of Ka \nJoma near a public market and the revolu\ufffdonary \nslogans, \u201cViva CPP-NPA-NDF!\u201d and \u201cJoin the New \nPeople\u2019s Army!\u201d on several public walls. Meanwhile, \nalso in a statement, the NDF in Southern Tagalog, \nbrimming with revolu\ufffdonary commitment and \nop\ufffdmism, pledged to con\ufffdnue \u201cforward the \nrec\ufffdfica\ufffdon movement and advance the people\u2019s \ndemocra\ufffdc revolu\ufffdon un\ufffdl victory.\u201d\n\n\n\n23Despite repeated promises of the Marcos Jr. regime \nto \u201cend the armed conflict\u201d in the Philippines, the \nNew People\u2019s Army (NPA) con\ufffdnues to advance the \npeople\u2019s war by launching consecu\ufffdve tac\ufffdcal \noffensives, ambush opera\ufffdons and puni\ufffdve ac\ufffdons \nagainst elements of the fascist Armed Forces of the \nPhilippines (AFP) and their agents in Rizal, Masbate, \nand Negros in the first few months of 2024.\nOn January 31, a unit of NPA-Rizal Narciso Antazo \nAramil Command successfully launched an ambush \nopera\ufffdon against soldiers of the 80th Infantry \nBa\ufffdalion (IB) opera\ufffdng in Lukutang Malaki, \nBarangay San Isidro, Rodriguez, Rizal. Three were \nconfirmed dead among the ranks of the fascist \ntroops. The NPA unit retreated safely and was \nunharmed.\nAccording to reports, the 80th IB\u2019s intense and \nrelentless focused military opera\ufffdons in Rodriguez \nhave been going on for nearly a year. Apart from \nserving as guards of the Wawa-Tayabasan Dam \nbeing built, troops of the 80th IB also protects the \ninterests of the ruling big landlords such as the \nAranetas, Villars and Robles, in Lukutang Malaki. \nThe rampant militariza\ufffdon brought fear to locals in \nthe area due to mul\ufffdple cases of harassment, \nsurveillance, food blockades, popula\ufffdon control, \nand other human rights viola\ufffdons perpetrated by \nthe 80th IB.\nOn January 13, a unit of the NPA-Masbate Jose \nRapsing Command hit the 96th IB troopers opera\ufffdng in Si\ufffdo Lantawan, Barangay Gangao, \nBaleno, Masbate. The said military unit immediately \nhid their casual\ufffdes to cover up their losses. \nAccording to Ka Luz del Mar, NPA-Masbate \nspokesperson, the armed offensive is part of their \nefforts to seek jus\ufffdce for the vic\ufffdms of military \nabuses in the area and defend the people against \nongoing military opera\ufffdons in the province. Among \nthose referred to by Ka Luz include the 24 vic\ufffdms \nof poli\ufffdcal killings in Masbate under the US-Marcos \nJr. regime. Residents are also indignant at the \npersistent encampment of \u201ccounterinsurgency\u201d \nunits of the AFP and the Philippine Na\ufffdonal Police \n(PNP) in schools in the province \u2013 an outright \nviola\ufffdon of interna\ufffdonal rules of war. According to \nreports, pros\ufffdtu\ufffdon also became rampant in the \nareas where military camps were being built. \nMeanwhile, NPA-Northern Negros Roselyn Jean \nPelle Command launched consecu\ufffdve puni\ufffdve \nac\ufffdons against perpetrators of the Sagay 9 \nMassacre and other enemies of the people in \nseparate opera\ufffdons last January 2 and February 13. \nA .22 rifle and 44 rounds of ammuni\ufffdon, a .357 \npistol plus bullets, two smartphones and various IDs \nwere recovered by guerilla fighters a\ufffder the ac\ufffdon. \nOn January 9, 2024, the NPA-Negros Oriental \nLeondardo Panaligan Command similarly mounted \na puni\ufffdve ac\ufffdon against a notorious intelligence \nasset of the local police in Sityo Mainit, Barangay \nBulado, Guihulngan City, Negros Oriental.\nNPA units welcome the year with \nseries of tactical offensives, ambush \noperations against AFP in Rizal, \nMasbate and Negros\nBy Hugo Francisco\n\n\n24www.ndfp.info\nThe guerilla is like a poet\nKeen to the rustle of leaves\nThe break of twigs\nThe ripples of the river\nThe smell of fire\nAnd the ashes of departure.\nThe guerilla is like a poet.\nHe has merged with the trees\nThe bushes and the rocks\nAmbiguous but precise\nWell-versed on the law of mo\ufffdon\nAnd the master of myriad of images.\nThe guerilla is like a poet\nEnrhymed with nature\nThe subtle rhythm of the greenery\nThe outer silence, the outer innocence\nThe steel tensile in-grace\nThat ensnares the enemy.The guerilla is like a poet.\nHe moves with the green brown mul\ufffdtude\nIn bush burning with red flowers\nThat crown and hearten all\nSwarming the terrain as a flood\nMarching at last again st the stronghold.\nAn endless movement of strength\nBehold the protracted theme:\nThe people's epic, the people's war.by Jose Maria SisonThe Guerilla Is Like a Poet", "pdf_links": ["https://philippinerevolution.nu/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-January-March-Liberation-International.pdf"], "type": "article", "title": "PRWC \u00bb Liberation International | January-March 2024", "description": "Liberation International is a publication of the NDFP International Information Office", "author": ["admin"], "categories": ["Liberation International", "Publications"], "source_name": "Philippine Revolution Web Central"}
