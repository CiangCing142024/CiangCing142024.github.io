  Kristiansand: Marking the Palestinian Land Day

</h3>
<p>
  On Saturday, March 30, the match committee participated in a mark of land day. Appeals were held and read poems, before the participants went by train through the center and sang and shouted slogans for a free Palestine.
  <br>
<br>
  Landdag, Yom Al-Arm, is marked annually in memory of the events on March 30, 1976, when 6 unarmed Palestinians were killed and around 100 were injured by Israeli forces, and 300 were arrested. This happened under a protest against Israel's plans to confiscate 2000 hectares of land from Palestinian farmers in Galilee. Landdag symbolizes the Palestinians' ties to its country and the fight against Israeli expansion, and the day is marked in Palestine with protests and planting olive trees to confirm their connection to the country.
 </br></br></p>
<p>
  Israel continues to seize large parts of Palestinian land and describes the areas as military zones, state land and other terms. From 1 November 2022 to October 31, 2023, Israel has approved the construction of at least 24,000 illegal housing units on Palestinian soil. On March 22, Israel declared the confiscation of 800 hectares on the occupied West Bank, and on March 6, Israel approved the construction of around 3500 new residential units in the West Bank.

<p>
  First, they take images with a banner denouncing the symbol of the column of the Square of Vendôme. The following is written on the banner:
 </p>
<p>
<em>
   The commune of Paris, considering that the imperial column of the Square of Vendôme is a monument of barbarism, a symbol of the brute force and the false glory, an affirmation of militarism, a negation of international law, a permanent insult of the winners to the defeated, a perpetual attack on one of the three main principles of the French Republic, the fraternity. It is decreed: the column of Place Vendôme will be destroyed.

  that it will not be allowing UNRWA aid convoys to enter northern Gaza. UNRWA is the main agency providing aid in Gaza, and its funding has already been cut by many imperialists due to Israeli allegations. We have earlier written on Israel using famine as a weapon

  of March having targeted Israeli Merkava tanks, destroying one completely. They have also clashed with a group of IDF soldiers barricaded inside a building, killing and wounding multiple of them in the vicinity of the al-Shifa hospital. Multiple IDF soldiers were wounded and killed also near Nasser hospital near Khan Younis. Al-Quds Brigades report they have wounded and killed IDF soldiers in an ambush west of Khan Younis. Israeli sources report that a sergeant major of the IDF was killed and 16 other soldiers were wounded on Friday in Gaza. On the border to Lebanon, Hezbollah continues carrying out air strikes against Israel.

   On the afternoon of Thursday 28/3 a gathering of the 
 LARCO employees in Syntagma Square, outside the ministry 
 Finance. About 850 LARCO employees have been fighting for years 
 to keep their jobs. Fight against the approaches of all 
 governments, against the depreciation of the company and the facilities, defending the right 
 them at work

 Hundreds of workers from the unions of LARCO, the Lavrion Labor Center and the Associations of Athens were found at the gathering. The class course supported the concentration with its presence, shouted slogans and distributed
 <a href="https://taxikiporeia.blogspot.com/2024/03/blog-post_28.html">
  calls
 </a>
 to the concentrated workers.
 <br>
<br>
 However, once again, the illusions of the PAME unions were shown, who, with their placements, also gave the pulse of concentration. Referring to the government "to do its job properly" and illusions about its decisions and the possible solutions she will propose, a delegation of the gathered went up to the Treasury to meet with a "government step". The government's intentions to close the business are well known and appeared after an hour of discussions, when representatives, although "celebrating for success", announced simply an extension of employee contracts for 40 days.
 <br>
<br>
 The struggle of LARCO workers for full and stable work, with decent wages and terms of work, must continue and find the solidarity of all employees

  On the eve of the 1964 coup, the agrarian issue was the most urgent in Brazil. The peasant movement shook the country proclaiming through the peasant leagues the requirement of “land reform in law or marra”, of the end of the concentration of land. The dread of the ruling classes in the face of the peasant combative attitude, especially the landowners, increasingly dragged them to the side of the fascist reaction and coup. At the same time, Yankee imperialism was sure that a movement of that mining type not only its hegemony but the very foundations of national subjugation.

  , by Alberto Passos Guimarães, of the same year, for example, are also testimonies of a living attempt to represent and analyze the agrarian issue. The government, equally, could not go over it or add it, which is why one of the most important components of João Goulart's base reforms was land reform. Congress, in 1963, even approved the Rural Worker Statute, which, in theory, would give the peasant the same rights as urban workers.
 </p>
<p>
  In the famous speech in Central Brazil, on March 13, 1964, Goulart said he sought the “abolition of captivity for tens of millions of Brazilians who vegetate in the interior, in revolting conditions of misery”. The government chosen by the government to achieve the result, which involved the mobilization of the Armed Forces (FA) in the demarcation and attribution of the land and in the guarantee of the process and depended on the acceptance of a constitutional change that would allow the payment of compensation to landlords in securities of Public debt, failed. Disregarding the popular mobilization, Goulart's agrarian reform, which did not want to be “in Marra”, was the victim of the landlord reaction and the FA, which proved once again which interests actually defended and their coup destination.

<strong>
   The peasant alloys
  </strong>
</h2>
<p>
  The first Brazilian peasant leagues were born in 1945, under the direction of the Communist Party of Brazil (P.C.B.), having its legal existence shortened by the passage of the party to clandestinity, as early as 1947. Despite the dissolution in 1948, the leagues, which emerged to hundreds and organized thousands of peasants, left a permanent mark in the combative peasant movement, heading

  .
 </p>
<p p="">
<p>
   When the foundation of the peasant leagues was found to be marked by the leadership of Francisco Julião in 1955, the right to be buried and the peasants had their own coffin was claimed, in fact, the right to be buried,
   <a href="https://anovademocracia.com.br/da-luta-pelos-mortos-a-lutar-pelos-vivos-a-historia-das-ligas-camponesas/">
    The interest of the dead in hunger and misery
   </a>
   , as highlighted by doctor and geographer Josué de Castro. The class character of the peasant struggle soon stressed, however. The founding of the Pernambuco Agricultural and Livestock Society, in Engenho da Galileea, was attended by Oscar Arruda Beltrão, landowner owner, who, despite having accepted the invitation, soon began to attack the peasant claims such as “Artimanha Communist ”next to the other land owners of the region and had the organization close. Julião, a lawyer and deputy for the Brazilian Socialist Party (PSB), who has already defended since 1940 the rights of the peasantry, was sought by the peasant families to defend his case and promptly accepted the call. From a lawyer, however, he immediately passed the social agitator, learning more and more that the law would always benefit the landlord.
  </p>
<p>
   Under the defense and political leadership of Julião, the peasant alloys, as they would be called by the reactionary newspapers that compared them to the old Leagues of P.C.B. And name that would adopt with pride, expanded and spread, going beyond the borders of the state and taking the Northeast field. The desperation of the landowners in the face of powerful mobilization created the urgency that they would soon be undertaken repressive measures.
  </p>
<p>
   Not only the landowners, however, but the United States itself paid attention to the Northeast. The Yankees thought that the Leagues were coming to finish the work of the Armed Popular Uprising of 1935. The monopoly of the press
   <em>
    The New York Times
   </em>
   , he said in 1960 that the leagues were a Marxist organization that wanted to repeat the achievements of the Cuban revolution or the Chinese revolution, giving the statements the apocalyptic imprint that was proper to the anti -communism of the time. Since the year before the claim for the “land reform in law or marra” was sung by the peasantry. In 1961, all the robustness of the political struggle of the peasantry was demonstrated, and was held in Belo Horizonte a congress of the alloys that gathered delegations of 20 states and being unanimously approved the program of the Radical Agrarian Reform, which claimed the definitive liquidation of the landlord and The end of all feudal and slave survivors in the countryside.
  </p>
<p>
   In addition to the political leadership of Julião, the leagues were directed by important figures of the combative peasant movement, as

    Alípio de Freitas
   </a>
   , Amaro Luiz de Carvalho and Diniz Cabral Filho. The military leadership of the leagues was

   </a>
   , revolutionary and great mobilizing and organizing the struggle for land - also Julião's companion.
  </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>
    1964: The Reaction of the Old State
   </strong>
</h2>
<p>
   The imminence of the coup had been drawing since Goulart's inauguration, he herself already marked by the interventionism of the military ministers, who prevented him at the first time from having full powers imposing an unconstitutional parliamentary regime. Several leagues leaders were, at this time, systematically murdered by jagunços and police supported by the old state, preparing land for the fascist reaction. Also the progress of Trombas and Formoso had, for the landowners, to be immediately stopped.
  </p>
<p>
   Combining the legal struggle for the land and self -defense against the Latifundium attacks, the combative peasant movement defended, on the one hand, the agrarian reform, but required urgency and its deepening, in the concrete defending a revolutionary change to be started from the countryside and that that It would fulfill democratic steps that the old Brazilian state, bourgeois-bourgeois for essence, never fulfilled. These steps were not in accordance with the interests of the landowners and also of Yankee imperialism, which is based on national subjugation the maintenance of agro -export and primary production, of the landlord, that is. At the
   <em>
    Manifest to the nation
   </em>
   From 1962, the peasant alloys and other land struggle organizations said with all the letters that a government that leaned on the Yankee programs, as an alliance for progress “or other forms of spoliation of our homeland” could only deserve the repulsion of peasantry. Julião, in particular, said about Goulart:
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    “The historical conjuncture required him to jump from the wall - either right or left. The man preferred to jump to the right, clinging fiercely, suffering from the check book of the 'Alliance for Progress'. Dead are, as for him, the hopes of the Brazilian people. ”
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   In Trombas and Formoso, in 1962, 20,000 titles were granted to the squatters. Allied of the Peasant Leagues, the Union of Farmers and Agricultural Workers of Brazil (ULTAB), managed in 1963 to press the Goulart government to pass the Rural Worker Statute. Despite this, however, the government was reluctant to directly challenge the landlord and the imperialism that supported it. He left the landowners, many of which already defenders of the military coup and fascism, armed. This also denounced Julião in a letter to the Goulart Government Minister, saying:
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    "If the army does not disarm the landlords or outlaw the henchman on the grounds that it must maintain the private ownership of the land structured in a feudal manner with all its injustices and cruelties, it has no right to prevent the peasants from arming themselves to defend life and liberty, which are the most sacred goods, which is the right of self-defense that is recognized even for animals."
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Agrarian reform "in law" could never be accepted, much less since it was known that once the peasant demands had been conquered, the movement of struggles for democratic transformations in the country could never be stopped. As soon as it took place, the military coup criminalized the Association of Workers of Trombas and Formoso, the Peasant Leagues and other peasant movements that were growing and challenging the existing order. Political activists and leaders have been hunted down, imprisoned and tortured. Porfírio and Julião were both imprisoned, Alexina Crespo went into exile and began to fulfill tasks of international relations of the Leagues. Others, such as Alípio de Freitas, went underground, fighting against the fascist military regime within the country. Studies show that more than 1,600 peasants were killed by the military.
  </p>
<p>
   Just as the most urgent peasant question was at that moment to the Democrats and Revolutionaries, the reaction also gave him great importance, attacking the organizations of the combative peasant movement and thus thinking about the struggle for land as a whole.
  </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>
    The combative peasant movement was not defeated
   </strong>
</h2>
<p>
   Despite the claims of the 64 scammers, the combative peasant movement was never defeated and reorganized around the claims by the earth and the end of the landlord, guiding itself even more concretely around the anti-ending and anti-imperialist struggle . In 2010, Alexina Crespo sent a message to the expanded meeting of the National Commission of the Poor Peasants League in which she said:
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    “I want you to multiply, centurate this organization of you to all over Brazil, and while I can help, while I have a Germany I will continue fighting. I don't know how: speaking, speaking, speaking, and even who knows a few punches, I can give it too. ”
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   The League of Poor Peasants, in particular, is constantly under attack from the landlords and the repression of the old state for its consistent struggle to liberate the country from the chains imposed by semi-feudalism, for the distribution of land to those who live and work on it.
  </p>
<p>
   As before, however, the old state continues mainly defending the interests of landowners and acts as an assistant to their reaction against the peasantry. None of the governments that came after the fascist military regime dared to frontally challenge this old wound in the country, thus leaving the roots of the most archaic reactionarism well found in the nation's chest.
  </p>
<p>
   When we remember the coup of 64, therefore, we must also remember this: as long as there is landlord, an entire class, a portion of the people, the peasantry, especially the poor peasantry, will never know what democracy is, will not live under a democracy.

   CPP Information Bureau | Communist Party Of The Philippines
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
   March 31, 2024
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  The Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) today paid tribute to the fallen Red fighters of the New People’s Army (NPA) killed in skirmishes in Batangas and Quezon provinces last week.
 </p>
<p>
  The CPP’s Chief Information Officer, Marco L. Valbuena, honored the Red fighters and leaders of the Party as heroes and martyrs of the Filipino people’s revolution for national and social liberation.
 </p>
<p>
  In Batangas, three Red fighters were martyred in a firefight in Barangay Elvita (Tubahan), Rosario last March 26. Killed were Junalice “Ka Arya” Arante-Isita, Bernardo “Ka Mamay/Mike” Bagaas and Erickson “Ka Ricky/Vale” Cueto. Arante-Isita, 37, served as a leading cadre of the revolutionary movement in Batangas and was a member of the Regional Committee of the CPP in Southern Tagalog.
 </p>
<p>
  In Quezon, two beloved warriors of the people were killed in an encounter in Guinayangan town last March 28. Martyred were Divine Sureta (Ka Zoe), who hailed from the indigenous Manide tribe, and Paul Cruz (Ka Isko), who at the time of his death was a member of the CPP’s Quezon Provincial Committee.
 </p>
<p>
  “Their deaths are huge losses to the Party, the NPA and the masses whom they wholeheartedly served,” Valbuena said. “Their sterling examples in struggle and ultimate sacrifice, however, serve as inspiration for more people to take the hard path of waging armed struggle.”
 </p>
<p>
  “Even now, more and more young people are joining the NPA as they see the necessity and justness of waging revolutionary armed struggle against the puppet, corrupt, and fascist Marcos regime,” Valbuena added.

  In Porsanger municipality in Finnmark, Sami reindeer herders are fighting against the development plans for Skarvberget wind farm.
 </h3>
<p>
  TV2 reports that in the municipality of Porsanger there is a majority to investigate the possibilities for the company Fortum Nordkraft Vind to set up 20 to 40 wind turbines in an area of 50 square kilometers. The area includes "sieddeduotts", a sacred area in Skuohtanjárga Siida, and is used as a summer pasture by several reindeer herding from Karasjok. However, the CEO of Fortum Nordkraft, Gabriel Karlsen, claims above TV2 that the "final area" for development, if realized, will be about 20 square kilometers.
 </p>
<p>
  Reindeer herding Lemet Aslat Eira clearly expresses the article what he thinks about the development plans: "Let's put it this way: Those are not doing well with those who destroy the sacred area". He also says that his family has had summer grazing in the area for generations, and that the investigation is experienced as the municipality trying to chase away the Sami. Eira told TV2 that: "When pressed in a corner, how to get out of the corner quickly? We are pressed from all sides. ” When asked if he "fears (...) that it will be violent," he says "I do not exclude violence, but I hope it does not go so far that we must resort to violence." He is aware that he believes such an extension will be a human rights violation, that "it is war" and that they "will fight with all means".
 </p>
<p>
  TV2 writes that on February 22, there were about 150 people outside the municipal building in Porsanger to demonstrate against the municipal council. Head of the Norwegian Samers National Association Youth (NSR-N), Elle Márgget Nystad, who is also among the activists fighting against wind power at Fosen, encouraged a boycott of the municipality. The limb Aslat Eira agrees with the call to boycott: “If the plans are realized, it will mean the hook on the door for us. It is absolutely horrible and I agree that Porsanger should boycotted. (…) This is about the future and they will meet huge resistance. And the money is going to go abroad anyway, so I think Porsanger is going to be left with Blackper. ”

For the past 55 years our Red fighters  have fought the people's enemy with courage and honor.  They are the beloved warriors of the masses. We salute  their valor, render the highest honor and tribute to the  revolu�onary martyrs and heroes of the New People’s  Army, and offer our deepest gra�tude for the sacrifices  they have given to triumph against the enemy. The enemy always aims to destroy the revolu�onary  movement and halt the surge of people’s struggle. But  no coercive instrument of the state, no ma�er how brutal  and fascis�c, can stop the people from figh�ng for a new  social system. It is the brutal violence and intolerable  burden of exploita�on and oppression by the comprador  big bourgeoisie, landlords and monopoly capitalists that  drive the masses to persist in the struggle.  The greed of foreign and domes�c capitalists  dehumanizes the workers, peasants and all toiling  masses. The violence of exploita�on and oppression  against the masses that persists day a�er day, and the  criminal disregard for their abject poverty legi�mize the  justness of the people’s war and thus must be supported.  The Filipino people commit themselves to armed  revolu�on not because they glorify wars. They commit  to it because they understand that it is only through armed struggle that their aspira�ons for a just,  developed, and progressive society will be fulfilled.  For more than five decades, the revolu�onaries and the  masses have withstood the onslaughts of the enemy. The  hardships and sacrifices of the Filipino people and their  army have built a strong founda�on for the advance of  the na�onal democra�c revolu�on and the crea�on of  the People’s Democra�c Government.   Imperialism and the local reac�onaries may seem like a  formidable foe. But we have the people on the side of  revolu�on and once aroused, organized, and mobilized  in their millions, they become an invincible force. It is the  responsibility of the revolu�onary movement to  con�nue arousing, organizing and mobilizing the people  wherever they are.  Despite the huge number of the enemy forces, weaponry  and heavy support from US imperialism, the  revolu�onary movement has been able to counter and  defeat every strategic counterrevolu�onary plan  implemented by the regimes from Marcos Sr to Duterte.  The current Marcos Jr. regime's “oplans” will suffer the  same fate. The par�cipa�on and support of the masses for the  revolu�on are unwavering. Addi�onally, the  revolu�onary forces abroad, including Filipino migrants, <br/><br/>3are greatly inspired by the sacrifices of the New People’s  Army. Many have expressed their desire to fight  alongside the people’s warriors.  Indubitably, the boundless courage and daringness of  the masses and revolu�onary forces in the face of  sharpening class contradic�ons shall be kept in the  treasure chest of stories that inspire the revolu�onary  movement’s con�nued advance.    Rec�fica�on and Resurgence Building on its achievements and founded on the strong  support of the figh�ng masses, the Party has embarked  on a rec�fica�on movement to address its weaknesses  and errors and advance the people’s war to even greater  heights. This rec�fica�on movement strengthens and  unites the Party and the people along the correct  revolu�onary line and steels the figh�ng will and  capabili�es of the masses and the people’s army to face  the enemy. History has shown that revolu�on advances  when rec�fica�on is undertaken to correct errors and  implement tasks to further advance the people’s war,  and to prevent devia�ons from the principles of  Marxism-Leninism-Maoism that guide the people’s  democra�c revolu�on.  Resurgence in all aspects of work for the revolu�on  results from the rec�fica�on by the revolu�onary  movement. Analyzing and summing-up our work,  correc�ng errors and pu�ng stress on what must  immediately be done will energize comrades to fulfill  their responsibili�es and tasks.  People’s war is a necessary undertaking in the building  of the People’s Democra�c Government that responds  to the needs of the masses. The old social order must be  destroyed in order to build upon its rubble and ashes a  just, equitable, and pro-people system of governance.

EDITORIAL BOARD Ma. Lourdes Barros Hugo Francisco Jose Emilio Jacinto III Ricardo Lozano Raya Andres – Montañosa  Ana Rosario LIBERATION INTERNATIONAL is a publication of the NDFP International Office Amsterdamsestraatweg 50, 3513 AG, Utrecht, The Netherlands Email us at contact@ndfp.org <br/><br/> 4“[T]he NPA makes them suffer casual�es and defeats through ambushes, raids, arrest  opera�ons, demoli�on work and other forms of  sabotage. The enemy is like a big monster that cannot protect its body parts  and is bleeding to death from many wounds.” — Jose Maria Sison, 2021 “Poli�cal power grows out of the barrel of a gun.” — Mao Tse Tung, 1927 In 2023, the New People’s Army (NPA) launched  numerous victorious tac�cal offensives causing the  fascist enemy to bleed with a thousand cuts.  Recently, the Narciso Antazo Aramil Command of NPA  - Rizal successfully ambushed the opera�ng troops of  the 80th IBPA in Lukutang Malaki, Barangay San Isidro,  Rodriguez, Rizal. More tac�cal offensives are certainly  in the offing.  How does the NPA, thus, prepare for a tac�cal offensive?  Libera�on Interna�onal, on the occasion of the New  People’s Army’s 55th anniversary, interviewed a Red  fighter to delve into the process of moun�ng an  offensive.  Pre-tac�cal offensive Before any tac�cal offensive (TO) is launched, it is  me�culously planned wherein several crucial elements  are primarily taken into account, such as poli�cal gain,  the masses’ gain, social inves�ga�on and class analysis  and the masses’ readiness. Based on these considera�ons, the responsible  command determines which kind of offensive befits the  masses’ and the NPA’s capaci�es, exis�ng poli�cal  situa�on and other security aspects.  A tac�cal offensive takes months to prepare, depending  on the size of an opera�on. For instance, big, annihila�ve  offensives entail a longer prepara�on as it involves  orienta�on and consolida�on of forces, stockpiling, and  iden�fying areas to retreat, to name a few. When it  comes to small ac�ons, a ‘window of opportunity’, for  example, the enemy passes by an area at a given �me,  prompts swi� prepara�ons. It also depends on the masses. Their determina�on and  asser�on can contribute to a swi�er prepara�on. More  importantly, without the masses’ unwavering support,  there would never be a successful tac�cal offensive.  They play a pivotal role in the en�re process—from  preparing the place, determining the places to retreat,  ensuring sufficient food and supply, inves�ga�ng the  security situa�on, and monitoring the movement of the  enemy, to knowing when to strike.  In carrying out all these tasks, the people’s mili�a units,  who act as local NPA units in the barrio, along with the  self-defense units of revolu�onary mass organiza�ons  are also mobilized.  Actual tac�cal offensive In all tac�cal offensives, every Red fighter deals with a  lot of tension and a lot of things play in their minds which  is but natural. The NPA though knows how to handle the  situa�on well. They li� each other’s morale, and keep  themselves focused on their objec�ve.  During the actual tac�cal offensive, a great deal of �me  is spent lying in wait, which can last up to three days or  even longer.  Once the opera�on is mounted, two things can  happen— either it is successful or not. OffensivesTacticalOffensives By Raya Andres - Montañosa<br/><br/> Primarily, a successful TO is measured by the extent of  damage inflicted on the enemy or the enemy’s reduced  figh�ng capability. The impact on the enemy is, thus,  more important than the sheer number of enemy  casual�es. T o illustrate, it is successful if a sizable number  of arms are seized from the enemy or if they lose their  morale, even if it is a minor tac�cal offensive, yielding  minimal or zero enemy casual�es.   Contrarily, the effect is the opposite if it is not successful.  If this happens (and in any situa�on), the most important  thing to do is to assess the results to form an objec�ve  analysis of the circumstances and to draw lessons. Also,  it is important to make the masses understand the  lessons from their own experiences, regardless of the  results of a tac�cal offensive. Abor�ng or stopping a tac�cal offensive can also  happen. One of the main reasons is the extent of harm  to the masses and the NPA. This usually happens when  the social inves�ga�on is incomplete, or the analysis of  the data gathered is wrong. Hence, the importance of  conduc�ng a thorough study and analysis to collect  informa�on on the enemy’s movements, their stop  points, the right �me to strike them and their  vulnerabili�es, among others. Post-tac�cal offensive When a tac�cal offensive is successful, the masses  certainly celebrate it. O�en�mes, even the masses who  live far from the revolu�onary mass base are delighted  upon hearing such successes. Resounding and victorious  tac�cal offensives have beneficial effects both on the  organized and non-organized masses. Whether an NPA opera�on is successful or not, enemy  retalia�on is always expected. If they can no longer  pursue the retrea�ng NPA, they are likely to retaliate  against the masses. Even in the preparatory stage, the  NPA and the masses prepare for retalia�on by ensuring  that the masses are ready to face the enemy’s threats,  in�mida�on, and harassment. In the areas where there  are organs of poli�cal power, revolu�onary mass  organiza�ons prepare for these retaliatory ac�ons  through role-playing. Under any circumstances, the  masses must realize that safeguarding each other and  refusing any a�empt to separate them from their  community is vital to protec�ng every one of them.   As for the NPA, the most important thing to do during  the retreat is to get the masses’ intelligence reports on  enemy movements. It is paramount to know, for  instance, the enemy’s entry point. If the enemy enters  the area, the masses communicate this to the NPA  immediately.  Some�mes, when the NPA retreats a�er a bigger  offensive, there is a team that stays behind to delay or  deliver another heavy blow to the enemy. The enemy,  who usually retaliates to exact revenge, is most  vulnerable during this �me.  The masses are again ac�vely involved in this process.  A�er a tac�cal offensive, the masses know that the red  fighters are �red and hungry. So, they carry their things  and keep safe the materials and some arms that are used  for the opera�on, as well as prepare and serve them  food. Next to giving intelligence reports, they also get  rid of any trace of NPA presence during the retreat to  prevent the enemy from loca�ng the NPA.<br/><br/> 6place is in the Strugglewoman'sA On the occasion of the Interna�onal Working  Women’s Day on March 8 and the 55th anniversary of  the New People’s Army, Libera�on Interna�onal offers  women Red fighters’ insights on building a  revolu�onary family in the context of waging an armed  revolu�on. Ka M: “As a mother, I try to a�end to my child’s needs  while fulfilling my du�es as a Red fighter. At the same  �me, we give our full trust to the masses to ensure the  safety of our children and that their needs are met.” “As partners, my husband and I are assigned to  different guerilla units located far away from each  other most of the �me. Thus, we make sure that our  requests for visits and reunions are put forward to our  respec�ve collec�ves in a �mely manner.” Ka Mabini: “First of all, it must be recognized that  society puts a heavy pressure on women, especially  mothers, that they must be responsible for their  children. Especially among the ranks of Red fighters, we  must overcome this preconceived no�on dictated by  society that the woman, the mother is confined only to  reproduc�ve roles. In this sense, it is important to  understand that the woman’s place is in the struggle.  For a Red fighter, it is not only your own child’s welfare  that counts when it comes to decision-making. As an  NPA and Party member, we serve the revolu�on to  secure the future not only of our own children but for  Philippine society as a whole. Most of the �me, we  cannot be with our children, who are usually taken care  of by the masses since we are in the midst of a people’s  war. Any NPA member has the right to have a family, but it  is important to put this in the context of waging a  revolu�on. This means that we are in the context of  war where the NPA’s duty as well as the welfare of the  Party and the en�re revolu�onary movement prevail  over and guide the process of raising a revolu�onary  family.”<br/><br/> 7 By Jose Emilio Jacinto III Another a�empt to change the 1987 GRP cons�tu�on  (charter change or cha-cha) is currently underway and  has been triggering unrest among the people and within  the ro�en ruling system.  Cha-cha's have been a�empted by every GRP regime  a�er Cory Aquino. The 1987 Cons�tu�on was framed  precisely to prevent another Marcos dictatorship (the  GRP president is limited to  one six-year term). Despite  its reac�onary character, the 1987 GRP Cons�tu�on has  a clear commitment to patrio�sm and social jus�ce, and  it declared the Philippines nuclear-free. These a�empts followed the same script and ended in  failure because of the preeminence of the selfish poli�cal  objec�ves of those holding power to perpetuate  themselves. The move to change the cons�tu�on began a few weeks  ago in early January 2024, when a nondescript YouTube  video was posted poking fun at the 1986 “EDSA people  power revolu�on,” which ousted the fascist dictator  Ferdinand Marcos, father of Ferdinand Marcos Jr. A so-called people's ini�a�ve started a week later,  collec�ng signatures from the barrios and communi�es  to amend certain provisions in the 1987 cons�tu�on,  which cha-cha proponents blame as the cause of the  country's underdevelopment. A people's ini�a�ve is a scheme that purportedly allows Filipinos to directly  propose amendments to the Cons�tu�on, without  requiring congressional ac�on.  A joint House and Senate resolu�on has been filed to  form both chambers into a cons�tuent assembly to  amend several ar�cles in the GRP cons�tu�on allowing  foreigners full ownership of public u�li�es, educa�onal  ins�tu�ons, and adver�sing, among others. However, progressive people's organiza�ons, poli�cal  opposi�on, and the church have argued and stood  strongly against cha-cha's revival. They assert that far  from being the solu�on to the Philippines’  underdevelopment, it is in fact being railroaded to  extend the term limit of Ferdinand Marcos Jr. According to Bagong Alyansang Makabayan (Bayan), this  revival of cha-cha is no different from the a�empts of  previous regimes to use it for their selfish poli�cal  ambi�ons. The cha-cha revival is in fact ini�ated by  Marcos Jr.'s cousin, Speaker of the House of  Representa�ves Mar�n Romualdez, who reportedly  spent Php20M per district (about USD350,000) to buy  the signatures of the people. The Philippines has around  253 congressional districts. Bayan argues that apart from its ul�mate goal of  removing term limits of elected officials, cha-cha will New attempt at “Cha-Cha”  exposes GRP's rotten political  and economic system<br/><br/>8further open the economy to foreign plunder and  exploita�on and the return of permanent US military  bases in the Philippines. According to Bayan, this is the  reason why the US is also behind the Marcos Jr.  government in this ini�a�ve. Blaming the 1987 cons�tu�on for the roots of the  country's problems is covering-up the reality of  unbridled bureaucra�c corrup�on, feudal and  semifeudal exploita�on and imperialist control of the  poli�cal and economic system of the country, Bayan  emphasizes.  The GRP has been consistent in covering up these  problems when talking peace with the revolu�onary  movement and blaming the armed resistance as the  cause of the country's poverty and underdevelopment.  It has tried to trip the revolu�onary movement to  surrender to the GRP cons�tu�on. In fact, the cha-cha  a�empts show that the GRP wants to mu�late its own  cons�tu�on. During the 38th anniversary of the EDSA uprising,  thousands marched in the Philippines and overseas to  protest Marcos Jr.’s scheme to change the charter. They  organized a broad network opposed to changing the  1987 Cons�tu�on, which bans poli�cal dynas�es, sets  term limits for public officials and provides other guarantees to ensure that the state has “checks and  balances,”  and prohibits 100% foreign ownership of  land, key infrastructure, strategic industries and facili�es  in the Philippines. The broad opposi�on network against cha-cha also  asserted that instead of focusing on wrecking the  cons�tu�on, the GRP should address the people’s  demands for wage increases, lower prices, and be�er  social services. They also called for resolving the anomalous 2022  elec�ons which installed Marcos Jr. and Duterte. As the Marcos Jr. regime remains determined to push  for cha-cha despite the failures of previous a�empts and  amidst the Filipino people's resistance, the people's  militant democra�c movement and its poli�cal allies  must intensify their vigilance in opposing and figh�ng  further moves of the regime to perpetuate itself in power  and allow further imperialist intrusion into the country's  economy and poli�cs.  This current push for cha-cha has only exposed the ruling  bureaucrat capitalists’ drive to perpetuate themselves  in power, further sell the country's sovereignty and  integrity to imperialists, and desecrate the people's  fundamental rights and freedoms.<br/><br/> 9COMPATRIOTS-NDF, the revolu�onary  organiza�on of Filipinos overseas and a  member of the Na�onal Democra�c Front of  the Philippines (NDFP), believes that the  Philippine Cons�tu�on is a worthless piece of  paper that legi�mizes and jus�fies oppression and exploita�on of the Filipino people in a  semicolonial, semifeudal society ruled by US  imperialism, bureaucrat capitalism and  feudalism.  All Cons�tu�ons (1934 and 1943) that had  been in effect since the United States’ crea�on  of a so-called Philippine Commonwealth, then  followed by the Philippine Republic, were  imposed on the Filipino people to legi�mize its  neocolonial rule. The 1973 Cons�tu�on or  Marcos Cons�tu�on, which replaced the pre- WWII cons�tu�ons, made President Ferdinand  Marcos Sr. a one-man ruler. The cons�tu�on  that Marcos implemented made him a dictator  and allowed him to stay in power longer  through the declara�on of Mar�al Law. The Filipino people’s an�-dictatorship struggle  led to the ouster of Marcos in 1986, paving the  way for the Corazon Aquino government and its  1987 Cons�tu�on, which included some  favorable provisions such as the ban on nuclear  and foreign military bases, limi�ng foreign  ownership to 40%, an�-poli�cal dynasty and  term limits for elected officials including the  president. These provisions had been the  subject of many devious a�empts by previous  puppet regimes to amend them.  Marcos Jr. and his allies in his ruling class  fac�on are behind the moves to revise the  1987 Cons�tu�on. He aims to �nker with this  piece of paper with changes that will enthrone  his family and cronies once more in perpetuity while ensuring the support of US imperialism by  allowing the la�er and its allies to plunder our  resources and complete the annexa�on of the  Philippine archipelago as its military base in the  looming inter-imperialist shoo�ng war with  China. The oppressed and exploited classes and  sectors of the Philippine society have all the  reasons to oppose Marcos Jr.’s Charter Change.  Compatriots-NDF believes that the people’s  opposi�on against Charter Change is growing  and will succeed as it is linked and raised to the  an�-imperialist, an�-bureaucrat capitalist, and  an�-fascist struggle.  We call on the Filipino People to expose and  oppose the Marcos Jr. Regime as US  imperialism’s new tyrant at the helm of the  puppet government of the Philippines. Any  changes to the current 1987 Cons�tu�on of  the Republic of the Philippines only aim to  consolidate and perpetuate the power of the  ruling classes of bourgeois compradors, big  landlords, and the bureaucrat capitalist state,  and favor the con�nued plunder and war- mongering agenda of its US imperialist master.  No amendment to the current neocolonial  Cons�tu�on will provide relief or salva�on to  the Filipino masses from poverty, des�tu�on,  and oppression. The Filipino people’s na�onal  democra�c revolu�on is the only and true  solu�on to the fundamental economic, poli�cal,  and socio-cultural problems of the Filipino  people.  Onward with the People’s War!  Defeat Imperialism!  Advance the People’s Democra�c Revolu�on! People’s War Not Constitutional Change  is the True Answer to the Filipino  People’s Problems Statement of COMPATRIOTS-NDF (Revolu�onary Organiza�on of Overseas Filipinos and Families)<br/><br/>Marcos Jr. and Duterte stumble  further towards international  isolation<br/><br/>“seemingly unchecked powers” due to the An�-T error  Act, which was passed into law during Duterte’s �me.  The UN experts expressed “serious concern about the  seemingly broad and unchecked execu�ve  powers…par�cularly the discre�on of the An�-T errorism  Council to designate individuals and organiza�ons as  ‘terrorists’ and the An�-Money Laundering Council to  adopt targeted financial sanc�ons therea�er.”  The le�er was signed by Fionnuala Ni Aolain, special  rapporteur on human rights while countering terrorism;  Irene Khan, special rapporteur on the promo�on and  protec�on of the right to freedom of opinion and  expression; Clement Nyaletsossi Voule, special  rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful  assembly and of associa�on; Mary Lawlor, special  rapporteur on the situa�on of human rights defenders;  José Francisco Cali Tzay, special rapporteur on the rights  of indigenous peoples; and Nazila Ghanea, special  rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief. In July 2023, the Interna�onal Criminal Court (ICC)  rejected an a�empt by the Duterte camp to block an  inves�ga�on into the thousands killed during Duterte’s  so-called ‘war on drugs.’ Following the ICC’s  announcement, Marcos Jr. stated that his regime would  not cooperate with the ICC inves�ga�ons claiming the  interna�onal court has no jurisdic�on in the Philippines. By refusing to cooperate with the ICC,  Marcos Jr. lays  bare his culpability in shielding the Duterte regime’s  reign of state terror that killed 30,000 people and  vic�mized the Filipino toiling masses for six long years. It can be recalled that this series of diploma�c incidents  hounding the reac�onary regime was preceded by a  falling out between the Marcos Jr. and Duterte ruling  fac�ons. First triggered by conflict over the bureaucra�c  loot in the controversial ‘confiden�al funds’ of the Office  of the Vice President (OVP) Sara Duterte (daughter of  Rodrigo Duterte), the feud between the two ruling  cliques has developed into exple�ve-laden exchanges.  Earlier this year, Rodrigo Duterte called out Marcos Jr.  for plo�ng to amend the cons�tu�on to li� the  president’s term limits. He also accused Marcos Jr. of  being a drug addict. In turn, Marcos Jr. responded by  saying Duterte was fond of using fentanyl, a powerful  opioid drug.  The worsening crisis of the semicolonial and semifeudal  system in the Philippines has not only sharpened the  contradic�ons between the Marcos Jr. and Duterte  ruling cliques but has also intensified the people’s  resistance against neoliberal offensives and increasing  fascism  by the current regime. The unprecedented level  of crisis and repression unfolding is only bound to worsen  Marcos Jr. and Duterte’s isola�on from the Filipino  masses and from the interna�onal community.<br/><br/> 12 CREATING FREEDOM  AND WRITING THE  FUTURE FOR OUR  CHILDREN An interview with Dahoud Shebab, Spokesperson of the  Islamic Jihad in Gaza by the Liberation staff  Through the help of friends from the interna�onal media, the  Libera�on staff was able to send a set of ques�ons to the Pales�nian  resistance movement based in Gaza. The ques�ons focused on the  reasons why the October 7 military ac�on against Israeli forces was  launched, the unity of various groups and forces in Pales�ne, the vision  of a free Pales�ne, and the lessons the world could learn from the  Pales�nians as they wage their war of libera�on and self- determina�on.  The Islamic Jihad is among the various groups within the Pales�nian  Forces Alliance, which includes Hamas, Popular Front for the  Libera�on of Pales�ne, Popular Struggle Front, Pales�nian Libera�on  Front, Vanguard for the Popular Libera�on War-Ligh�ng Forces, and  the Fatah Al-In�fada Movement. <br/><br/>13Below is the transcript and transla�on of the video interview with Dahoud Shebab.  Minor copy edi�ng was done for this print version.       Libera�on: What was the immediate trigger of the October 7 a�ack against the Israeli  government? Is there a strategic goal behind this? Dahoud Shebab (DS):  October 7 was an expression of the angry Pales�nian  rejec�on of all forms of repression and terrorism by Israel over many years against  the Pales�nian people. October 7 is not isolated from the rest of the Pales�nian  resistance before October 7. We must say that the Pales�nian resistance is about defending its land and  defending its people. The resistance is not a group of killers and killing in itself is  not the goal. It is not to cause a state of destruc�on and ruins. Rather, it seeks to  pressure the occupa�on and use legi�mate means to raise its voice to the world  and deliver its message, especially in the light of Israel's complete denial of the  rights of the Pales�nian people and the con�nued Israeli a�acks on the Al-Aqsa  Mosque, Jerusalem, the West Bank; Israel's con�nuous viola�ons of prisoners'  rights; and the con�nuing siege of the Gaza Strip. All these were done by Israel  without anyone in the world doing anything to stop them. We have been warning and sending messages to mediators, all par�es, and the  United Na�ons that Israeli policies will lead to a major escala�on and an explosion  of the situa�on. Before, we witnessed great aggression by Israel. There was killing  of Pales�nians at checkpoints in the West Bank in cold blood. Every day there were  vic�ms. Did anyone look at those vic�ms? No. No one looked.  Came October 7. The aim was to tell Israel and send a message to the whole world  that the Pales�nian resistance can cause instability if Israel con�nues its terrorism  and aggression; and that it is not only the Pales�nian people who will pay the price  for Israel's crimes. Se�lers, the whole region and the whole world may pay the  price. All stability will be undermined if Israel con�nues its a�acks. L: Did you an�cipate Israel’s counter-a�ack to be in this magnitude?  DS: We are aware that Israel is a brutal, bloody and criminal state, especially this  extremist government. We know what they can do. But we did not know that the  Israeli government does not care about its prisoners and soldiers in the Gaza Strip.  That it can even resort to killing them if only to ensure that this leadership or the  Israeli fascist government achieves poli�cal and electoral gains in its internal  compe��ons. Israel has even ignored the humanitarian calls made by the  Pales�nian resistance since day one of this ba�le for the release of civilian  prisoners or civilian detainees for humanitarian reasons. We have said this and called for it. Hamas has also called for it. However, Israel  has not paid a�en�on and has con�nued to carry out criminal and bloody bombing  and destruc�on that has made vic�ms even of Israeli civilians and foreign  na�onali�es. Israel did not care at all for its civilian prisoners, not even the military  personnel in the hands of the Pales�nian resistance. Indiscriminate and destruc�ve shelling occurred whether there were Israeli  prisoners, foreign na�onals, or others. En�re neighborhoods were exterminated  with its residents, civilians, or prisoners held by the Pales�nian resistance. Israel  showed no respect even for minimum humanitarian and moral values in the Gaza  Strip, especially in the areas of Gaza governorate and in northern Gaza. L: What is the vision of a free Pales�ne? What do you intend to do with Israeli residents  who were already born and residing in Israel for so long? DS: To be clear, all this land is for Pales�nians and like any country in the world,  when we take full rights and sovereignty over our land, then the government  chosen by the Pales�nian people can decide how to deal with foreign expatriates,  whether Jews or non-Jews. We have no problem with Jews; we have no problem with anyone. Our problem  is with Israeli Zionists who occupied our land. We have posi�ve and good rela�ons <br/><br/>14with many Jews in the world. They never believe in occupa�on. They reject the  occupa�on. We have no problem with them. The problem is with Israeli Zionists who came and occupied our land and  established a state on our land. Now when we take the right to our land and be  liberated, we can choose our own government. This government, like any  government in the world, can decide on these na�onals: grant them na�onali�es  or not grant them. The problem is that Israel is the occupier. We, therefore, treat the Israeli people  as occupying our land. They are all occupiers, but upon our libera�on, we will  decide on it. Like any country in the world, you decide on it.  This ma�er applies to different countries of the world as well. Also, why is it  permissible for a group of countries, such as NATO member states, to establish  an alliance with each other and have joint defense agreement but other  countries could not?  This is a natural right that Pales�ne exercises when it, too,  has entered an alliance with other countries such as Iran, Yemen, Iraq, Lebanon,  and other countries or other powers, to support the cause of the Pales�nian  people. L: An alliance of different resistance movements is now formed, are there other  poli�cal forces working at a different direc�on? How was this unity achieved?  DS: We welcome any party that wants to support us as Pales�nians and we will  not stand against it. But it is important that there is no interference in our  policies and in our method of work. That is, no one should intervene. The  Pales�nian resistance has independent posi�ons and are not linked to any  foreign agendas as claimed by the Israeli occupa�on and other countries that  support it. We aim to achieve a more comprehensive Pales�nian unity. Today, we are more confident than ever before in our ability to achieve internal  Pales�nian reconcilia�on. The great plight of the Pales�nian people today as a  result of the Israeli aggression requires building true unity, especially as some  countries are trying to interfere in our affairs and imposing the form and method  of managing ourselves. We know how to manage ourselves and know how to  decide our des�ny. We will never accept interference from any external party. Our Arab brothers have many things in common. We all are in consensus on  what things may be like in the coming days, and we will not allow Israel to impose  on us the form, administra�on, and method of governance in the next phase. L: What could possibly threaten this unity? DS: Israel is the constant threat to Pales�nian unity. Israel, which kills the sons of Fatah, the sons of Hamas, the Islamic Jihad, the  PFLP (Popular Front for the Libera�on of Pales�ne) and the DFLP (Democra�c  Front for the Libera�on of Pales�ne-Marxist Leninist organiza�on) and kills all  the Pales�nian people in the West Bank. Israel is the most serious threat to  internal Pales�nian unity. It has always been a major obstacle to achieving  Pales�nian unity.  Today, everyone is fully aware that there is no future for a se�lement with Israel  and that Israel is a bloody, criminal, and terrorist en�ty. In the long term, we  believe that this convic�on will promote greater efforts to overcome internal  poli�cal differences and lead to building a true Pales�nian unity created by the  Pales�nians. This is a right exercised by all occupied na�ons and subjected to aggression but  won their independence at the end. There is no occupa�on that lasts forever,  not in all human history. We seek our freedom. Therefore, our vision is despite all Israeli threats our resistance will be further  strengthened. Israel will not be able to end the resistance, because as long as  there is an occupa�on, the resistance will remain. This is a natural thing, and we  are confident that we are closer to victory.<br/><br/>15L: The struggle of the Pales�nians is now at the center  stage of the world, gathering millions of supporters.  Would you consider this a poli�cal victory? DS: The whole world today is looking at the  Pales�nian people, the injus�ce done to them and  the need for the Pales�nian people to exercise their  rights. We are commi�ed to use all our rights  throughout our land. This is what we hope to  achieve.  Today, there is a great deal of empathy and support  for the Pales�nian people, including Arabs,  foreigners and people of all races and ethnici�es.  There is great sympathy for the Pales�nian cause.  There is great support for the right of the  Pales�nian people to resist, regardless of the  posi�ons of the colonial countries.  We do not expect anything from Britain, for  example, or the Bri�sh government. Britain is  known to be a colonizing country. France is a  colonizing country. The United States of America is  the main sponsor of all the chaos that prevails in the  world. It created chaos in Iraq, in Afghanistan, in  Pakistan and in other countries. The American  experiments—even when America wanted to create  governments in its own mold—failed miserably and  put these countries into misery, and their future  became sorry and uncertain.  L: Having demonstrated the higher unity and capacity  for waging this war of libera�on, what are the  prospects now? DS: People always create their freedom with their  own hands. Today, the Pales�nian people have  decided to create their freedom and write the future  of their children by their own hands. We defend the future of our children in future  genera�ons. They should live a decent, safe and  stable life like other peoples of the world. But to remain under siege and suffer the injus�ce  prac�ced against us by Israel, and to remain hostage  to the policies of starva�on and killing -- all of this  must stop.  Yes, today we are making great sacrifices. But these  sacrifices will be a light of hope for a real bright  future for the next genera�ons.  Today, the world faces the test of whether to be  loyal and honest with itself, and to take sides with  these values and principles, which were the result  of a great deal of wars and bloody, deadly and  destruc�ve conflicts. L: What is your take on the role of Israel’s allies and  supporters? DS: We must see the United States of America for  what it really is. It is not a civiliza�on, it has not  created civiliza�on, it has not created stability, but  instead has created ways for itself to dominate the  whole world. Today is the �me for the world to be  free from American domina�on, from slavery to the  US dollar, and for the world to take sides with  jus�ce. There can be no jus�ce in the light of the con�nued  occupa�on of the land of Pales�ne, the occupa�on  of the Pales�nian people, and the con�nued  suffering of the Pales�nian people among the other  peoples of the world who are also suffering as a  result of American and Western colonial policies. The whole world is a vic�m of the policies of Europe  and America's colonial policies. They plundered the  world's wealth, destroyed the environment,  destroyed the world economy, and dominated  poli�cal affairs. Today, there is a true awakening in many countries  and peoples in the world, and must be strengthened  and must con�nue.<br/><br/> 16Kamil “Ka Alex” Manangan was raised in a pe�y- bourgeoise upbringing and a na�ve of Punta, Sta.  Ana, Manila. She studied Business Administra�on at  the Polytechnic University of the Philippines (PUP)  where she ac�vely par�cipated in a young women  students’ organiza�on and engaged in poli�cal work  among her fellow students. During her organizing work in the urban area, Ka  Alex quickly realized the necessity of the na�onal  democra�c revolu�on and understood that armed  struggle was the only means to fully liberate  Philippine society.  She was among the many young revolu�onaries  who responded to the call of the Third Rec�fica�on  Movement for the youth to join the armed  revolu�on in the countryside. A�er a�ending the  Party’s anniversary celebra�on in Batangas in 2016,  she decided to stay in the New People’s Army for  six months a�er which she  commi�ed to becoming  a full-�me Red fighter under the NPA-Batangas  Eduardo Dagli Command.  Due to her excep�onal skills, Ka Alex quickly rose  through the ranks and became a poli�cal guide  within her unit. She par�cipated in military  opera�ons, including a raid on Henry Sy’s security  forces in Pico De Loro resort in Batangas. She  disguised herself as an officer from the Department  of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) and  served as a lookout. Ka Alex was happy and proud  to have been part of this historic puni�ve opera�on  against the Sy Family, owners of the Shoemart Malls  and chain of department stores and one of the  biggest comprador bourgeoisie families, who  grabbed thousands of hectares of land from the  peasants in Batangas. A�er this breakthrough experience, Ka Alex was  assigned to do mass work where she served as a  deputy poli�cal instructor for her platoon forma�on  in the town of Lian. She led propaganda and mass educa�on work within their area of responsibility. Ka Alex’s city-life upbringing was totally different  from the life of a guerrilla fighter in the countryside.  Yet, she would o�en tell her comrades how all her  physical exhaus�on would suddenly disappear  whenever she talked with the masses about their  daily lives and hardships.  Her determina�on was tested once more in a  defensive encounter in Barangay Lumaniag where  she and two other Red Fighters, Ka Jessie and Ka  Zac, got separated from their unit. She valiantly  withdrew her two wounded comrades and ensured  their safety. Undeterred by their predicament, she  went to nearby houses of the masses to seek help.  She did not know the masses in the area, but she  used her propaganda skills and experience in mass  work to gain their trust. The masses eventually  decided to help them by giving medicine, food,  lending clothes and providing a phone to contact  the others for back up. Ka Alex once again demonstrated her strength  when the fascist AFP (Armed Forces of the  Philippines) troops were closing in on the house  where they were staying. She raised the morale of  her wounded comrades by singing “Tigreng Papel”   (Paper Tiger) and repeatedly reci�ng the Party’s  oath: “I pledge…to safeguard the security of the  Party and all my comrades at the cost of my life if  necessary…”  Even a�er her harrowing experience in the face of  the enemy troops, Ka Alex showed no signs of  retreat or regret. Her experience in the ba�lefield  only further strengthened her determina�on.  When Ka Alex became a full-�me Red fighter, she  was elected as a member of the Party’s front  commi�ee. A�er a few months, she was assigned as  a poli�cal guide for her squad and later as deputy  poli�cal instructor for her platoon and logis�cs  officer for her unit. Throughout her �me in the NPA,  she demonstrated excep�onal zeal in poli�cal work  both among the people’s army and the masses.‘Women who struggle  are women who can  never be defeated’ Remembering the life of Kamil “Ka Alex” Manangan by Atan Dominguez<br/><br/>Ka Alex dedicated her talent and abili�es to  do painstaking mass work and touched the  lives of hundreds of peasant families in  Batangas.  As an exemplary revolu�onary woman who  gave up a comfortable life in the city to be  with the masses she vowed to serve, Ka Alex  will always be remembered as a hard- working, gentle, and forward-thinking  comrade.  She will always be remembered for  always quo�ng Mao’s words: “The women  who struggle are the women who can never  be defeated.” Ka Alex lived by these words  un�l her very last breath. She was martyred  alongside 13 others on November 28, 2017,  in an encounter with the mercenary AFP-PNP  troops in Nasugbu, Batangas. Although Ka Alex’s �me in the people’s army  may have been short, her life carries profound  significance for the masses she served. The  strength of her commitment and enthusiasm  for revolu�onary work is an eternal source of  inspira�on for the youth and women  revolu�onaries who persevere in advancing  the people’s war.<br/><br/> 18 Libera�on Interna�onal: The GRP has asserted that any  possibility of opening the peace nego�a�ons would be a  ‘restart’ of the whole process, including the framework of  the nego�a�ons. Will the NDFP Peace Panel table this as  a first item (the framework) in ini�al discussions when both  panels meet face to face? Julie de Lima :  We are not for a ‘restart’ but for a  resump�on of peace nego�a�ons. As the first item when  we meet with the GRP team in April, it will be the  discussion on the framework of the peace nego�a�ons.   The Hague Joint Declara�on as the framework for peace  nego�a�ons has resulted in several substan�ve  agreements, the most important of which are the Joint  Agreement on Safety and Immunity Guarantees (JASIG)  and the Comprehensive Agreement on the Respect for  Human Rights and Interna�onal Humanitarian Law  (CARHRIHL).  We cannot consign these to the waste  basket. Both the GRP and the NDFP have put in a lot of  painstaking and deliberate effort in the course of 36  years. Thus, we will insist on discussing the reaffirma�on  of all previous signed agreements. LI: When the Duterte regime scu�led the talks in 2017,  both panels have been engaged in discussions on the  comprehensive agreement on social and economic  reforms, considered to be the “heart and soul” of the  nego�a�ons. Has this substan�al ma�er ever been  men�oned or discussed in framing the statement  recognizing the “serious socioeconomic and environmental  issues” facing the Philippines? JL:  I made a brief presenta�on of the NDFP dra� CASER  at a mee�ng with the GRP team in March 2023.  We  meant this to be among the serious socioeconomic and  environmental issues facing our country.  But we did not  have an in-depth discussion on this with the GRP team. LI: This year will be the 26th year since the Comprehensive  Agreement on the Respect for Human Rights and  Interna�onal Humanitarian Law (CARHRIHL) was signed  by the GRP and the NDFP. In light of recent and con�nuous  reports of aerial bombings, killings and massacres against  peasants, ac�vists and hors de combat in the Philippine  countryside, how can the broad interna�onal solidarity for the Philippine revolu�onary movement hold the GRP  accountable for its war crimes? JL:  The current Ferdinand Marcos Jr. regime can be held  accountable for viola�ons of the CARHRIHL, which the  government co-signed with the NDFP.  But since these  acts cons�tute war crimes, he can also be held to  account under the Nuremberg principles. Like Duterte,  Marcos Jr. can also be charged under the terms of the  Interna�onal Criminal Court. Other avenues including  quasi-legal courts of public opinion can also form the  basis of future legal ac�ons to hold Marcos Jr. and  Duterte for their war crimes. LI: What would the NDFP consider as the most  fundamental and substan�al item that needs to be  urgently addressed in its dra� of the agreement on social  and economic reforms? JL:  The most fundamental items that need discussing  are agrarian reform, rural development and na�onal  industrializa�on.  These form the founda�on of the  na�onal economy and are the keys to ending poverty  and joblessness in the country and ensuring economic  growth. LI: GRP factotums have voiced nervous concerns about the  CPP's current rec�fica�on movement, even saying that  intensifying the people's war runs counter to the “spirit” of  the peace nego�a�ons, are there bases for them to have  cold feet? Would there be implica�ons for the peace talks,  as they imply? JL:  The CPP’s current rec�fica�on movement is sure to  revitalize and lead to the resurgence of the revolu�on  which in turn compels the GRP to address the root  causes of armed conflict. Of course, the enemies of the  people would be concerned about this.  LI: Should the formal peace talks be convened again soon,  is the NDFP ready with its peace nego�a�ng panel? JL: The GRP has a long track record of undermining the  NDFP Peace Nego�a�ng Panel by targe�ng NDFP  consultants and nego�ators in clear viola�on of JASIG. HARDTALK: ‘WE ARE NOT FOR A  ‘RESTART’ BUT FOR A RESUMPTION OF PEACE NEGOTIATIONS’ Liberation International interview with Julieta de Lima, Chairperson, NDFP Peace Negotiating Panel<br/><br/>19On the second year of the fascist Marcos Jr. regime, the  toiling women con�nue to par�cipate in the armed and  unarmed forms of struggle to advance the people’s  na�onal democra�c revolu�on! The intense oppression and exploita�on of women in a  semicolonial and semifeudal society strengthen and  expand the membership of revolu�onary mass  organiza�ons such the Makabayang Kilusan ng Bagong  Kababaihan (Patrio�c Movement of New Women- MAKIBAKA). Majority of women belong to the poorest strata of  society, workers, farmers, indigenous and urban poor.  S�ll to recover from the widespread loss of jobs, falling  incomes, and inflated prices of goods and u�li�es caused  by the pandemic, the Marcos Jr. regime intensifies  women’s impoverishment through the con�nued  implementa�on of neoliberal agreements and policies. Marcos Jr.’s subservience to his US imperialist master is  blatant in the form of US-directed changes to the  country’s economic policies. In his current a�empt to  amend the 1987 Cons�tu�on via Charter Change,  Marcos Jr. further opens the country’s economy to  foreign investments in favor of imperialist profiteering.Decades of neoliberal policies implemented in the  Philippines have not resulted in any material  development for the people and for the economy.   Instead, trade deficits persist and the country’s economy  is constantly dependent on remi�ances from overseas  workers and from constant foreign borrowing. In the  past two years alone, the administra�on has incurred  Php1.82 trillion debt. In 2023, debt levels have reached  a total of Php14.62 trillion. Women and the rest of the  masses will surely bear the burden of paying these debts  for genera�ons to come. Because the country’s economy is �ed to the global  capitalist system, the crisis of imperialism has a direct  impact on the jobs and livelihood of the Filipino people.  As the crisis intensifies, so does the capitalist  exploita�on of the masses. The three biggest apparel  manufacturers that comprise 60% of the country’s total  garment exports implemented mass layoffs between  2019-2024 wherein an es�mated 80,000 women  workers lost their jobs. This was a�er the capitalists  issued a pull-out order from the Philippines and transfer  produc�on to other countries such as Vietnam and  Cambodia where labor is much cheaper. The severe exploita�on of the working-class Filipina  con�nues due to contractualiza�on, various forms of Statement of Makabayang Kilusan ng Bagong  Kababaihan (MAKIBAKA)  on International  Working Women’s Day, March 8, 2024Nevertheless, I expect that the Nego�a�ng Panel would  be completed as soon as the formal peace nego�a�ons  start. LI: How do you foresee the conduct of the peace  nego�a�ons in an�cipa�on that most GRP panel  representa�ves would be coming mostly from the Armed  Forces of the Philippines? JL:  We just have to wait and see how they conduct  themselves in the peace nego�a�ons.  General Ramos,  a military man, when he became president enabled the  GRP Nego�a�ng Panel to make progress in the peace  nego�a�ons.  As a ma�er of fact, the most substan�ve  agreements were made during his term. Just as it was in  Ramos’ �me when many substan�ve agreements were  made, it was also the military that scu�led the talks at  the �me of Cory, Gloria, Noynoy and Digong. Therefore,  it is the seriousness and readiness to engage that the GRP and its principal approach to the peace talks that  ma�ers more than the composi�on of the panel.  LI: Should the previous agreements already made in the  past rounds of peace talks be ‘negated’ , would there s�ll be  basis for the NDFP to con�nue engaging in the  nego�a�ons? JL: It is the responsibility of both par�es to recognize the  agreements made during the course of the peace  nego�a�ons since Cory Aquino’s �me because these  agreements were signed by legi�mate representa�ves  of both par�es. Regardless of who is appointed to each  nego�a�ng panel at whichever point in �me, the  effec�vity of such agreements must be recognized in  order for the peace nego�a�ons to proceed consistent  with the framework provided for by the Hague Joint  Declara�on. Should the GRP disregard these  agreements, then there would be no point for the NDFP  to pursue the peace nego�a�ons.<br/><br/> 20labor flexibiliza�on, low wages, dangerous working  condi�ons, discrimina�on, and violence. The increasing  number of unemployed workers contributes to the  crea�on of a large reserve army of labor that further  depresses wages and perpetuates contractualiza�on.  The current minimum wage remains grossly insufficient  and unlivable especially in the provinces. Minimum wage  in the Na�onal Capital Region (NCR) is only Php610  (approximately 10USD) while it is only Php316  (approximately 6USD) in the Bangsamoro Autonomous  Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM). In rural areas, women remain among the most  disadvantaged groups among fisherfolk, farmers and  indigenous peoples. For decades, rural women have  been suffering from severe and consistent economic  losses and hunger due to widespread landlessness and  the lack of state support for local agricultural produc�on. The reac�onary state has failed in all of its a�empts to  implement agrarian reform. Since the implementa�on of  Masagana ‘99 in 1972 by Marcos Sr., the Comprehensive  Agrarian Reform Program (CARP) in 1988 by Cory  Aquino, and the subsequent CARP Extension with  Reforms by Arroyo in 2009, the reac�onary state has  only protected the landlords and their haciendas that  should have been distributed to the farmers a long �me  ago. In 2021, there are s�ll 540,000 hectares of  distributable land under CARP that have not yet been  distributed. Widespread neoliberal economic reforms are causing  widespread joblessness among farmers and  farmworkers. Due to the impacts of liberaliza�on, highly  subsidized foreign agricultural products are flooding the  country resul�ng in losses for small-scale producers.  They are instead forced to sell their products at cheaper  prices, despite the high market prices of rice and other  basic food commodi�es.  The emergence of revolu�onary women's organiza�ons  in the countryside is caused by the starva�on of farmers, who are the producers of the people's food. In the  absence of agricultural support from the state, coupled  with state-sponsored violence, the reac�onary  government itself is pushing rural women to par�cipate  in armed struggle.  Because the feudal-patriarchal society �es women to  housework as the primary caregiver of the family,  women are among the first to be affected by sky-high  commodity prices and unlivable wages. Women who  demand the right to a living wage and a safe workplace  are in�midated, fired, arrested, and raped. In the  provinces, workers are no longer allowed to work in  nearby factories simply because they are unionized or  are members of a worker’s associa�on. In this situa�on, women's par�cipa�on in social and  na�onal libera�on to free themselves con�nue. The  severe economic and poli�cal crises are pushing them  to organize fellow women, par�cipate and lead mass  struggles such as in pickets, land occupa�ons and  people's strikes, and take the revolu�onary path of  armed struggle. T ogether with all who are oppressed and exploited, it is  necessary for the Filipina women to destroy imperialism,  bureaucra�c capitalism, and feudalism so that they can  all be free. Highest tribute to all the revolu�onary women martyrs  who sacrificed their lives for the victory of the people's  war! Long live MAKIBAKA! Long live the na�onal democra�c revolu�on! Long live the unity of women and people of the world  against imperialism! (This is an abridged version of the original MAKIBAKA  statement in Filipino translated to English by Ana Rosario.)<br/><br/> 21 KA JOMA LIVES!  STUDY MOVEMENT:  IMMORTALIZING  KA JOMA’S LEGACY  The passing of beloved comrade, Ka Jose Maria  Sison, fondly called Ka Joma, on December 16,  2022, gave birth to a movement that serves to  immortalize his legacy and propagate his works and  teachings to the Philippines and the world.  Launched by the revolu�onary movement in the  Philippines and abroad, Ka Joma Lives! is a dynamic  and vibrant study movement that conducts  campaigns and ac�vi�es that commemorate his life  and contribu�ons to the Philippine na�onal  democra�c revolu�on and the world proletarian  struggle.  In 2023, Ka Joma Lives! Study Movement organized  three major webinars, namely: “The Specific  Characteris�cs of Our People’s War”, “Our Urgent  Tasks”, and “Rec�fy Our Errors, Rebuild the Party!”.  These events featured his seminal theore�cal  wri�ngs that outline the fundamental principles of  waging people’s war, carrying out revolu�onary  tasks, and revitalizing the party.  Next to these webinars, Ka Joma Lives! also  launched ten of his books under the Sison Reader  Series last year. These books, a compila�on of his  wri�ngs on movements, various sectors, imperialism in domes�c and interna�onal se�ngs,  interna�onalism, and rights, jus�ce and peace, are  published as Book 12: On the Legal Democra�c  Mass Movement; Book 13: On the Revolu�onary  Movement and Mass Work; Book 14: On the  Workers’ Movement; Book 15: On the Peasant  Movement and Agrarian Revolu�on; Book 16: On  the Youth Movement; Book 17: Women in  Revolu�on and Na�onal Minori�es and the Right to  Self-Determina�on; Book 18: Imperialism in the  Philippines; Book 19: Imperialism in Various Global  Regions; Book 20: Proletarian Interna�onalism and  Interna�onal Solidarity; and Book 21: People’s  Rights, Jus�ce and Peace. Recently, on March 9, Ka Joma Lives! organized a  back-to-back launch of Ka Joma’s books, also under  the Sison Reader Series. En�tled, Book 22: On  Neoliberal Globaliza�on, and Book 23: Intensifying  Interimperialist Contradic�ons, these books contain  a collec�on of Ka Joma’s wri�ngs on neoliberalism  and globaliza�on, and on the possibility of having an  interimperialist war, respec�vely.  Aside from these ac�vi�es, Ka Joma Lives! leads the  commemora�on of Ka Joma’s birth and death  anniversaries. By Ricardo Lozano and Raya Andres-Montañosa<br/><br/>22First death anniversary On December 16 last year, on Ka Joma’s first death  anniversary, Ka Joma Lives! hosted the gathering of  comrades, allies, and friends of the revolu�onary  movement in the Philippines at the NDFP  Interna�onal Office in Utrecht, the Netherlands to  celebrate his colourful and meaningful life. Through  various tributes, songs, poetry readings, and cultural  performances, he was honoured and remembered  along with several other martyred comrades.  This event also launched Ka Joma Lives!’ Poem  Project. Inspired by Ka Joma’s poem, “Stages of My  Life,” where he chronicled his poli�cal trajectory  using the season metaphor, the project invites  individuals to add a new stanza to the poem or  create their version and interpreta�on as a way of  con�nuing Ka Joma’s legacy.    Likewise, in the Philippines, an event en�tled  “Reflec�ons on Pales�ne, the Philippines, and the  Struggle for a Just and Las�ng Peace,” was  organized. Hundreds of individuals, including  veteran and young ac�vists, discussed and reflected  on Ka Joma’s life and wri�ngs. They shared their  thoughts and personal anecdotes on his works, such  as, “Our Urgent Tasks,” “On Revolu�onary  Violence,” and “The Filipino People’s Democra�c  Revolu�on is Invincible,” as well as on his thema�c  wri�ngs, such as on Israel’s aggressions and  massacre of the Pales�nian people, and peace talks  between the NDFP and the GRP.  In the countryside, on the same day, CPP and NPA  units also conducted various ac�vi�es to honor Ka  Joma, including the renewal of pledges to the Party.  Various guerilla fronts across the country reaffirmed  their wholehearted service to the Filipino people  and their commitment to offer their lives for the  victory of the people’s democra�c revolu�on. Ka Joma’s birthday This year, on February 8, Ka Joma Lives! celebrated  Ka Joma’s 85th birthday by organizing a webinar on  Ka Joma’s work, “Stand for Socialism Against  Modern Revisionism, and a cultural event in  Utrecht, highligh�ng Ka Joma’s valuable teachings  on the importance of being steadfast in holding an  an�-revisionist line and being diligent in studying  MLM. The cultural celebra�on also highlighted the  CPP’s call for rec�fica�on and resurgence, which is  an ideological call to (re)study the basic Party and  MLM documents to imbibe the proletarian  revolu�onary a�tude and style of work fully and  firmly, as well as to ac�vely combat liberalism,  conserva�sm and dogma�sm among other  ideological corrosives that destroy the Party and the  revolu�on. His birthday was also celebrated by the  revolu�onary movement in the Philippines. In a  statement, the CPP paid tribute to the con�nuing  relevance of Ka “Joma” and the validity of the  struggle for na�onal democracy. Members of  Kabataang Makabayan, a clandes�ne revolu�onary  youth organiza�on, in Rizal province, conducted an  ‘OP-OD” or opera�on paint – opera�on paste  ac�vity where they painted a large portrait of Ka  Joma near a public market and the revolu�onary  slogans, “Viva CPP-NPA-NDF!” and “Join the New  People’s Army!” on several public walls. Meanwhile,  also in a statement, the NDF in Southern Tagalog,  brimming with revolu�onary commitment and  op�mism, pledged to con�nue “forward the  rec�fica�on movement and advance the people’s  democra�c revolu�on un�l victory.”<br/><br/> 23Despite repeated promises of the Marcos Jr. regime  to “end the armed conflict” in the Philippines, the  New People’s Army (NPA) con�nues to advance the  people’s war by launching consecu�ve tac�cal  offensives, ambush opera�ons and puni�ve ac�ons  against elements of the fascist Armed Forces of the  Philippines (AFP) and their agents in Rizal, Masbate,  and Negros in the first few months of 2024. On January 31, a unit of NPA-Rizal Narciso Antazo  Aramil Command successfully launched an ambush  opera�on against soldiers of the 80th Infantry  Ba�alion (IB) opera�ng in Lukutang Malaki,  Barangay San Isidro, Rodriguez, Rizal. Three were  confirmed dead among the ranks of the fascist  troops. The NPA unit retreated safely and was  unharmed. According to reports, the 80th IB’s intense and  relentless focused military opera�ons in Rodriguez  have been going on for nearly a year. Apart from  serving as guards of the Wawa-Tayabasan Dam  being built, troops of the 80th IB also protects the  interests of the ruling big landlords such as the  Aranetas, Villars and Robles, in Lukutang Malaki.  The rampant militariza�on brought fear to locals in  the area due to mul�ple cases of harassment,  surveillance, food blockades, popula�on control,  and other human rights viola�ons perpetrated by  the 80th IB. On January 13, a unit of the NPA-Masbate Jose  Rapsing Command hit the 96th IB troopers opera�ng in Si�o Lantawan, Barangay Gangao,  Baleno, Masbate. The said military unit immediately  hid their casual�es to cover up their losses.  According to Ka Luz del Mar, NPA-Masbate  spokesperson, the armed offensive is part of their  efforts to seek jus�ce for the vic�ms of military  abuses in the area and defend the people against  ongoing military opera�ons in the province. Among  those referred to by Ka Luz include the 24 vic�ms  of poli�cal killings in Masbate under the US-Marcos  Jr. regime. Residents are also indignant at the  persistent encampment of “counterinsurgency”  units of the AFP and the Philippine Na�onal Police  (PNP) in schools in the province – an outright  viola�on of interna�onal rules of war. According to  reports, pros�tu�on also became rampant in the  areas where military camps were being built.  Meanwhile, NPA-Northern Negros Roselyn Jean  Pelle Command launched consecu�ve puni�ve  ac�ons against perpetrators of the Sagay 9  Massacre and other enemies of the people in  separate opera�ons last January 2 and February 13.  A .22 rifle and 44 rounds of ammuni�on, a .357  pistol plus bullets, two smartphones and various IDs  were recovered by guerilla fighters a�er the ac�on.  On January 9, 2024, the NPA-Negros Oriental  Leondardo Panaligan Command similarly mounted  a puni�ve ac�on against a notorious intelligence  asset of the local police in Sityo Mainit, Barangay  Bulado, Guihulngan City, Negros Oriental. NPA units welcome the year with  series of tactical offensives, ambush  operations against AFP in Rizal,  Masbate and Negros By Hugo Francisco<br/><br/>24www.ndfp.info The guerilla is like a poet Keen to the rustle of leaves The break of twigs The ripples of the river The smell of fire And the ashes of departure. The guerilla is like a poet. He has merged with the trees The bushes and the rocks Ambiguous but precise Well-versed on the law of mo�on And the master of myriad of images. The guerilla is like a poet Enrhymed with nature The subtle rhythm of the greenery The outer silence, the outer innocence The steel tensile in-grace That ensnares the enemy.The guerilla is like a poet. He moves with the green brown mul�tude In bush burning with red flowers That crown and hearten all Swarming the terrain as a flood Marching at last again st the stronghold. An endless movement of strength Behold the protracted theme: The people's epic, the people's war.by Jose Maria SisonThe Guerilla Is Like a Poet</p></div>

  With the participation of about 500 demonstrators, an anti-war-anti-imperialist mobilization took place on Saturday, March 30, against the bases in Thessaly and the country, as well as against the country's involvement in the ASPIDES operation and the war plans of the US-NATO forces in Ukraine. The demonstration, which took place at the initiative of the Popular Struggle Front "Kostas Vidalis", was attended by organizations and collectives from all cities of Thessaly as well as from Athens and Thessaloniki. This was preceded by an open call by this Front for discussion and movement coordination. The KKE (m-l) also participated in the discussions that took place, stressing the need to develop an anti-war-anti-imperialist movement against the transformation of Thessaly and the whole country into a base of war for the murderers of the USA-NATO-EU peoples.
 </p>
<p>
  The demonstration was colored by the anti-imperialist-anti-war slogans of the demonstrators, with common ground the slogans of solidarity with the just Palestinian resistance and against the US-NATO bases in the region.
 </p>
<p>
  The presence of the forces of repression was intense, with about 10 riot police vans following the march from parallel roads, while a large volume of riot police was on the way to the 1st Army, which is one of the operations centers of the European imperialists in their intervention in the Red Sea, preventing the demonstrators from marching. However, the demonstration continued and ended in the central square, where it started.
 </p>
<p>
  The KKE(m-l) participated with a militant bloc, with the participation of comrades and comrades from all over Thessaly.

  On March 8, International Women's Day, has been left behind. We see that those who "maintain" alive on March 8 have a great blurred consciousness. This blurred consciousness has led them to call March 8 "Women's Day" or "Working Women's Day." Leaving aside the possibility of using this nomenclature as a tactic to be "inclusive", we will treat the revisionist line that we see specifically; Because the fight against revision is in favor of our revolution and will help produce the correct line. This fight implies not only the destruction of the adversary, but also our own development. We must constantly fight to search, expose, defend and overcome the truth so that the revolutionary line can be victorious. We must not forget for a moment that those who assume the responsibility of producing and disseminating the revolutionary line are not free from the regression and the problems that will lead to it.

<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-b292455daf578bb4b9766e93ae26b5ae">
  In revolutionary women's organizations, especially in the last 10 years, we can say that feminist attitudes, sometimes timidly and sometimes boldly, have gained prominence. These attitudes, which are visible from declarations to slogans and banners, have "now" gone beyond the level of being a tendency, and a sexist tendency has begun to replace the class position. The scientific nature of this position, which is legitimized by calling it "the women's point of view," is never disputed. The righteous rebellion of the oppressed woman is reduced to the level of a reproach that fits within the order. From the point of view of the bourgeois woman, association is not perceived as a class problem. Since the ideological struggle against feminism is recommended, this process has evolved into supporting the feminist movement, following/not following it, and gradually resembling it.

     The thief's guilt will be revealed; In this article, we will deal with large landowners. While the women's organizations that claim to be revolutionary leave the question of women's emancipation for other issues, they seem to have thrown overboard what they stand for. Many women's organizations openly accept the line of feminism. In any case, what we expect from these organizations is nothing more than the way they currently express themselves. The problem lies with those who claim not to be feminists: Conformism will lead to uniformity and, ultimately, to the rejection of the revolutionary line. The reason we and some other women's organizations like ours are "marginal" is that they cannot "become the same," not because of incompetence, of course, but because of the revolutionary tradition on which they are based and the class attitude on which they feed.

     When we observe the statements of March 8 of the Democratic Movement of Women (DKH) and the Liquidationist Group of the right, we see the "unbearable lightness" of not even to call March 8 "International Day of the working woman." We can evaluate this situation as a "confusion" or a "keyboard hypocrisy", let's evaluate it as such and continue. In the DKH statement entitled "We rebel against war, poverty and women's massacres" and the word "war" in the title, we could not find a phrase in the content. With this approach, we see that March 8 is compressed only in identity policies. We understand that the declaration read by Comrade Barbara Anna Kistler on March 8, 92 has been erased from memory, allow us to remind us: "Contrary to what feminists say, the woman's question is inseparable from the class issue."

      There is acceptance of war as "man's work" by bourgeois currents. Unjust wars also exist to impose, consolidate and prevent the collapse of male domination. In unfair wars, women have been subject to enormous attacks, enslaved, captured, emigrated, sold in slave markets, subjected to worst torture and raped. Women's opposition to war is revolutionary if their main objective are unfair wars. Women do not have to be trampled herb while elephants trample!
     </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-57268e4ba2fc06bdbc8c2c4d3554fdba">
      Women who take sides in fair wars say that in the war they develop and release. Gül Kaya (Nergiz) states: "When it comes to war, a field symbolized by men, our work becomes even more difficult," and advises women to get rid of the vines that support them by the feet. GamzeGül Kaya (Ekin) Reality is captured when "my reasons for fighting increase day by day." Therefore, we will continue to participate in fair wars against imperialist-uninjusting wars. We want to "fight where there is life." This approach, which limits women to certain areas of struggle, is very dangerous. Women, who are part of humanity, must fight tirelessly in all fields by the liberation of humanity.

       Unity for what?

<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-ce13db763e1e1096a1b46a2e41216796">
      We often see these comrades following a bourgeois group, current or movement. We catch them insisting on unions based only on "power" by saying "the broadest unity." We know that being many, multiplicity without a goal of power is not power. You can't be strong if you consider practices that don't aim at power to be "lifelong."
     </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-f6045f8b44e81b98d2b3454d422b3257">
      In trying to respond to the process, deviations to the right and left manifest themselves in different ways. The action unions have begun to drift into ideological alliances because the mechanisms of criticism are not sincere and the plane itself is slippery.
     </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-b02de1a3d072cf2df6e2b768c29b9052">
      Without based on the unity of working women and the unity of women of oppressed classes, revisionism will be destiny. Faced with this, the development of the unity of action of the revolutionary organizations of women will pave the way for a revolutionary approach to the liberation of women.
     </p>

       No form of revisionism is innocent. The demand for disorganization is not a demand for protection and freedom for "individual women." On the contrary, it is a concern to protect already traditional individualism and feeds entirely the close interests of those who impose this demand, which have a place in this order. Of course we will also walk with them, of course we will also listen to you. We will do it without giving up developing our own line, without neglecting the responsibility of developing the correct line and without forgetting that the need for unity is born of the objective of making a great revolutionary war victorious.

   Marco Valbuena | Chief Information Officer | Communist Party Of The Philippines

   March 31, 2024
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  1. The Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) and the New People’s Army (NPA) and all revolutionary forces roundly reject Gen. Romeo Brawner call for Red fighters to abandon the armed struggle. The need to wage armed struggle is now greater than ever before amid the worsening socioeconomic conditions and oppression of the Filipino people and threats to the country’s sovereignty.
 </p>
<p>
  For the broad masses of peasants, workers, and other toiling people suffering from land grabbing, economic dispossession, low wages, joblessness, and other forms of gross social injustice, waging armed struggle now is ever more just and necessary. The US-Marcos regime has aggravated the situation of the people by serving the interests of foreign capitalists to the detriment of the Filipino people’s welfare and rights.
 </p>
<p>
  Under Marcos, the fascist reactionary armed forces has become even more aggressive and brutal in driving the peasant masses and indigenous minorities from their land to allow mining companies, plantations, real estate, energy and other infrastructure projects to expand their environmentally-destructive business operations.
 </p>
<p>
  Only by having the New People’s Army can the peasant masses effectively fight back against the onslaught of foreign and big business economic aggressors. In the interest of the broad toiling masses, the armed struggle can never be abandoned. To fight with arms is the only way for the oppressed to defend their life and dignity and fight for a better future.
 </p>
<p>
  2. In the face of increasing danger of the Philippines being dragged by the US military to its conflict with China, there is even greater need for the NPA to fight vigorously. The NPA must further intensify the armed struggle to help prevent US plans to fully utilize the country as a springboard for its acts of aggression. The US imperialists want to see an end to the NPA’s armed struggle so it can fully utilize the AFP as a pawn in its plans of aggression and hegemonic expansion.
 </p>
<p>
  General Brawner is a remorseless US mouthpiece when he declared in his statement that “external forces”, clearly referring to China, “undermine Philippine sovereignty and challenge our rights.” Brawner is utterly hypocritical to claim defending the country’s freedom against external forces when as chief of the armed forces, he has opened a number of AFP camps to give foreign military forces from the US extraterritorial rights to station its troops and military equipment, and turn the country’s land and water as their playground.
 </p>
<p>
  The US military forces in the Philippines have been using the AFP and the Philippine Coast Guard to raise the temperatures of military conflict in the West Philippine Sea through joint patrols, as well as US-backed “supply missions.” These operations are succeeding in pushing back against China’s incursions into Philippine maritime territory, but are being done at the expense of allowing US and its NATO allies to position their naval forces in Philippine waters.
 </p>
<p>
  The US plans to turn Marcos into a new Zelensky–a shameless beggar of military and economic aid from the US and NATO. They want to portray Marcos as a defender of Philippine freedom against the “empire”, while actually turning the Philippines into a protectorate of US-led Western imperialist powers, against their imperialist rival China.
 </p>
<p>
  Over the next few days or weeks, the Marcos regime is set to receive a major shipment or deployment of US military equipment for use of the AFP to turn it into a more aggressive force against China. This is timed with US plans to hold the Balikatan exercises in April as cover to deploy more of its troops in the country’s outlying islands, from the northernmost tip of Batanes, to the westernmost tip of Palawan. Even now, the US has already deployed Special Operations Forces in the Kinmen Island in the Taiwan Strait, a mere five kilometers off the eastern coast of Xiamen, China.
 </p>
<p>
  The Filipino people reject claims of the US imperialists of being “friends, allies, and partners” of the Philippines. It is utterly repugnant at all levels for the Marcos regime to ally itself to the number one terrorist who has connived with the Zionists in Israel in raining bombs and missiles on the civilian population of Palestine in Gaza, killing more than 32,000, more than half of whom are children. The US and Israel has also been supplying bombs to the AFP to carry out the same terrorist act in the Philippine countryside. The same imperialist US is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Filipinos during the US war of occupation of the Philippines, and the subsequent plunder of the country’s economic and human resources.
 </p>
<p>
  All the patriotic and revolutionary forces of the Filipino people must heighten their struggle for national freedom and draw inspiration from their long history of resistance to US military intervention and war–from the anti-colonial war of the early 1900s, to the mass protests leading to the eviction of US military bases and American troops in 1991.
 </p>
<p>
  Presently, they must vigorously resist US schemes and resist the plans to drag the country into US war provocations against China. Such a scenario will endanger the lives of the Filipino people and further place the country’s fate in the hands of the US imperialists.

  At the summit of the European Union (EU) in Brussels on March 21st and 22nd, the 27 member states voted for the admission

  According to British imperialism, it was felt that the Biden administration would seek a speedy resolution of the stalemate, but it did not do so due to "other domestic and foreign policy priorities."
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Faced with the deepening contradiction between American and Russian imperialism, most notably expressed in Russia's war against Ukraine, German imperialism is now seeking to resolve the stalemate in its favor by admitting the country into the EU, where it is the dominant power.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  With this step, Bosnia-Herzegovina follows Serbia, Montenegro and Northern Macedonia, which are in formal negotiations on an EU accession.
  <br>
  Of the other former parts of Yugoslavia, Croatia is already part of the EU and NATO while the

  from January 2024 will be manned by NATO's Kosovo Force (KFOR), which consists of 4,443 soldiers, in addition to the EU's civilian occupation force, EULEX, which consists of about 3,200 police officers, prosecutors and judges.
 </br></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  A special challenge for the imperialists is to integrate all countries of the former Yugoslavia into their institutions, despite the tensions they caused between the peoples.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has previously
  <a href="https://apnews.com/article/bosnia-eu-commissioner-candidate-membership-dff8d56e0d637763a9c27182314e7f61">
   explained,
  </a>
  That Bosnia-Herzegovina has to join the EU as a "only, united and sovereign country", which means that in the course of the country's integration, the situation that it is controlled by two different entities must be changed.
  <br>
  In addition, the imperialists in the EU, especially German imperialism, have to impose several reforms on the country before it is taken up. According to the Leyen, Bosnia-Herzegovina has completely adopted EU foreign policy and began to carry out other reforms, e.g. with taxes and immigration.
 </br></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The chancellor of German imperialism, Olaf Scholz, has declared that this is a "clear sign of a strong Europe." On March 21, during the summit, he expressed the interest of German imperialism in taking measures to expand its dominance in the countries of the former Yugoslavia as well as in Albania and to change the stalemate between Yankee, Russian and German imperialism in the region: "It is clear to me that the countries of the Western Balkans must be able to rely on us. The promise was made over 20 years ago. Now we have to take the next steps."

   The period following the Varkiza agreement was characterized by the brutal violence of the bourgeois state against the national resistance fighters who had handed over the weapons. On March 31, 1946, elections were held in which the KKE decided to abstain. We are republishing a related article of the proletarian flag. 777, (23/4/2016)

 The elections of March 31, 1946 and the attitude of the KKE's abstention in them were one of the events that occupied Greek political life. The opponents of the KKE and the EAM, the monarcho-fascist governments of the Civil War and the official post-war state attempted to exploit EAM-KKE's stance for abstinence, escalate terrorism and attribute the responsibility for the start of the civil war.
 <br/>
<b>
<br/>
  After Varkiza
 </b>
<br/>
<br br=""/>
<br/>
 In the first half of 1945 hundreds of national resistance fighters were murdered by paramilitary fascist gangs. 20,000 fighters were arrested on charges of being common assassins and 2000 of them were sentenced to death.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Former major insurers and collaborationist collaborators of the German Nazis were acquitted and began to staff the army and police. The bourgeois state was quickly reconstituted and with the help of the British and Americans and the mechanisms of repression were fully manned.
 <br/>
<br/>
<b>
  The announcement of the elections
 </b>
<br/>
<br/>
 In this climate and after successive changes in governments, at the end of 1945, elections were called by the government of centrist Th. Sofoulis, at the request of the British. The mere fact of widespread violence against the Left was enough to understand the outcome of the ballot box. Besides, the electoral rolls had not been cleared since the last elections were held in 1936. Even Sofoulis himself admitted it.
 <br/>
<br/>
 The forces that reacted to the elections realized that the political system could legitimize the terror status that had been imposed and invest it with a parliamentary cloak.
 <br/>
<br/>
<b>
  The run-up to the elections
 </b>
<br/>
<br/>
 On February 7, 1946, the EAM and the Left Liberals decided to call for the postponement of the elections and the formation of a "broad democratic understanding" government, the liquidation of the electoral rolls and the generalization of amnesty. In another case they would be oriented to abstention.
 <br/>
<br/>
 In mid -February, the 2nd plenary session of the CC of the KKE met and referred to the PG to make the final decision.
 <br/>
<br/>
 "Under these circumstances, the lighter elections are excluded. The elections being prepared is an attempt to "legal" a coup and an attempt to deceive global democratic opinion ... But the people are not going to fall into this trap. The plenary is perfectly applauding the following position of the CC. of the EAM, and the left -wing Liberals: ... EAM parties are obliged to officially and categorically officially declare that they will not participate in the elections, because it will simply be an electoral comedy which will have the most tragic results for the country ... "(2nd plenary session of the KKE, Katsoulis p. 86). The rest of the parties involved in the EAM had already been in favor of abstention.
 <br/>
<br/>
 The proposal to postpone the elections was immediately and categorically rejected by the British through a letter from Foreign Minister E. Bevin.

<span style="text-align: left;">
    Even the same Th. Sofoulis called for the postponement of the elections fearing unrest, but with the intervention of the US, which wanted a legitimate government, through Secretary of State Burns, threatened to withdraw its "aid". Sofoulis, in the end, disciplined his big bosses and the elections were held on the scheduled date.
   </span>
</div>
<br/>
  At the end of February, the KKE PG made the decision to abstain. But even the government itself continued by the government itself. In early March, many ministers resigned recognizing that the elections were essentially a coup.
  <br/>
<br/>
  G. Kafantaris himself, Vice -President of the Government, stated on March 8: "The determination of March 31 as the day of the elections was under two essential conditions: the state's cleansing of the state from the intense factional monastery and the restoration of the equality. Instead of a draw, the one -sided state of the state was seriously imprisoned and the life of democratic citizens became unbearable ... In the country there is a complete struggle of the democratic world and the unlimited denying of the organs of all kinds of monarchism ... … ”. (Ed. "Step" 3/3/46, Katsoulis p. 89).
  <br/>
<br/>
  It is worth noting that despite the terrorism that had spread throughout the country, the reactions of the people were important. Like that of May 1945 that gathered tens of thousands in the celebration. Even in March 1946, shortly before the election, hundreds of thousands of workers gathered at the Panathenaic Stadium seeking democracy and national independence. Also very massive were the pre -election rallies of the EAM parties in favor of abstention.
  <br/>
<br/>
  The KKE, in a last -ditch attempt to make a smoother development, proposed to the parties of the Center (Th. The effort, of course, reached the void as foreign bosses had made their decisions.
  <br/>
<b>
<br/>
   The conduct and results of the elections
  </b>
<br/>
<br/>
  The elections were finally held on March 31 in the presence of the Allied Observer Mission (Americans, English, French). The 1200 observers – the "owls" as the Greek people called them because they had the owl badge on the lapel – were content to observe the conditions of violence and fraud under which the electoral coup took place.
  <br/>
<br/>
  The report of the Allied mission of the observers argued that the elections "were held free and justly, calmly and in order ... and their outcome ... represents the real and valid verdict of the Greek people". They calculated abstinence at 9.3%!! It was determined in the following way. In five major cities they asked 100 passers -by whether they voted or not. And from the answers this percentage emerged !!
  <br/>
<br/>
  Official announcements from the government side spoke of 1,121,693 voters (women did not vote) with valid ballot papers of 1,108,473. As far as abstention is concerned, the announcement of the Ministry of Interior on 3/4/1946 referred to a percentage of 51.5%. The EAM estimated it at 53%.
  <br/>
<br/>
  It should be noted that there were threats that abstinence would have personal consequences and many civil servants were dismissed if they were abstaining.
  <br/>
<br/>
  Results:
  <br/>
<br/>
  UN National Late (People's Party and Other Right Parties) 55.12% (206 seats).
  <br/>
<br/>
  National Policy ENOSIS (S. Venizelos, P. Kanellopoulos, G. Papandreou, etc.) 19.28% (68 seats).
  <br/>
<br/>
  Liberal Party (Th. Sofoulis) 14.39% (48 seats)
  <br/>
<br/>
  National Party of Greece (N. Zervas) 5.96% (20 seats)
  <br/>
<br/>
  Union of Nationalists 2.94% (9 seats)
  <br/>
<br/>
  Rural Party Union 0.67% (1 seat)
  <br/>
<br/>
  Lists of independent candidates 1.09% (2 seats).
  <br/>
<br/>
  After the elections, on April 18, the government of K. Tsaldaris was formed.
  <br/>
<br/>
<b>
   The attack on Litochoro
  </b>
<br/>
<br/>
  A significant reaction from the persecuted fighters and at the same time a warning was the attack of the Pieria guerrillas at Litochoro Gendarmerie Station at dawn of the election. A small group of Olympus rebels led by A. Rosios (Ypsilantis) managed to terrorize the whole political system in Greece.
  <br/>
<br/>
  The guerrilla newspaper "Exormisi" describes:
  <br/>
<br/>
  "Spring of 1946. A few elasites who escaped the knife of the monarcho-fascists are hidden on Mount Olympus. Most of them are from Litochoro... Those few persecuted militants decided to carry out an armed action that would have the meaning of warning to monarcho-fascism on the part of the People... The target of the armed action was Litochoro, where terrorists have crippled the people with torture and murdered many fighters.
  <br/>
<br/>
  Night 30-31 in March, 33 popular fighters slip into Litochoro. The village is on fire ... The opponent left 23 dead on the battlefield. In the hands of the fighters, there were 4 prisoners and the first spoils of the armed struggle of our people: 4 automatically, 7 rifles, many ammunition ... ". (Vournas pp. 18-19)
  <br/>
<br/>
  The '46 elections and the rebel attack on Litochoro were essentially the beginning of the civil war. The Democratic Army of Greece (TSE) will be established in a short period of time and confront fascism and imperialism in the next three years.

  With more than 6 months of persistent and intensifying bombings and massacres against the Palestinian people in Gaza, the Palestinian people continue their heroic armed resistance struggle. Israel's occupation of Gaza pulls out and they cannot maintain control or achieve the quick victory they had hoped for. Their only "results" have been their bloody genocide and starvation of the Palestinian people in Gaza. But the blood that is wasted has only watered the resistance, which is growing, and so does international solidarity with the Palestinian people.

  Powerful passwords were shouted throughout the demonstration while actions were carried out during the demonstration. Each time the demonstration passed a company known for supporting Israel, it was painted with graffiti and stickers. Several huge Palestinian flags were hung down from scaffolding and at Queen Louise's bridge the tab of Danish imperialism was lowered and replaced with the tab of the Palestinian resistance.

  The size of the demonstration and fighting energy and hatred of imperialism and Zionism is a major moral and political defeat for Danish imperialism and Israel. The bourgeois press always tries to underpin demonstrations in solidarity with Palestine and sub -report the number of participants. They are trying to silence the movement, but the demonstration on Saturday made it clear that solidarity has never been more loud.

        Look at 
  The videos from Gaza is struck by ferocity 
 of the Israeli army; it is perceptible in every gesture, even 
 in free snorkels of children. There is no justice in it, 
 no ethical consciousness or justified action; There is only one 
 gigantic will to annihilate the Palestinians.

<span>
        Ferocity, 
  cruelty, terror. Any term is used to describe the 
 behavior of the Israeli army, even the most precise, will not be 
 never able to fully represent what is happening 
 really in Gaza. Which is something exceptional; extraordinary, 
 own.

       already seen, which re -tightened to others 
 genocidal drives, and a new type ferocity, which stands out for 
 the high technological capacity used against a people substantially 
 Unarmed. A painful and cowardly ferocity.

        It is
 It is clear that the aim of the Israeli army is not "the destruction of 
Hamas", but the removal of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip, 
First stage for a new colonization. It doesn't exist – nor is it possible, 
Given the history of that conflict – no different goal.

  It will not be a total departure, it will have to be balanced 
  - fragile - of that area of the world, rather than the ethical awakening of 
 Westerners or Arab countries. For the highly symbolic impact it has 
  Always had in the Arab populations, the "Palestinian question" is not 
 resolvable with a simple physical elimination of the Palestinians; 
 someone will have to stay alive, perhaps confined in some desert, 
 So that the balances are maintained at a guard level. Must 
 that the genocide is not complete so that Israel's goal will come

        At
 Gaza is not only shipwrecked by the ethics of Western countries, 
clearly deprived of its intrinsic "humanistic and liberating sense",
 But the inability of liberal democracies to stop a 
Genocide in progress. All the superstitions arising from the excess of 
familiarity with Israeli "democracy", from the propensity to 
tolerate their excesses and crimes, they handed over the Palestinians 
to the massacre.

<span>
        In
 For the past two years, we have become intoxicated with rhetoric, demonizing the 
autocracies and glorifying the liberal-democratic system; but the 
the pitiful spectacle offered by the West in the face of the genocide of the 
demonstrates – once again and unequivocally – that this 
It is not "values", "universal" rights or the law that counts. 
but only strategic alliances.

</p>
<p align="left">
<span>
<span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
<span>
        The 
  "Spirit" profound liberal-democracies is not very different from 
 that of autocrazies: You make history when you do business. From 
 consequence, any positioning different from the one that brings a 
 Strategic advantage is nefarious and must be carefully avoided. Until 
  When Israel will help to defend the western ambitions of 
 hegemony, until it is worthy of this role in the chessboard 
 medium-eastern, will not discredit its value.
       </span>

<span>
        Not 
  It is certain that the greatest mystification has revealed itself 
 In the most squalid representatives of militarized liberalism, i 
 fanatics of atlantism who did not hesitate to accuse of 
 Anti -Semitism anyone who has criticized Israel. Those who, for 
 understand us, do not fail to support the Ukrainian flag with that of 
 Israel, regardless of the logical short circuit and of every decency 
 intellectual.

<span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
<span>
        These 
  liberals from operetta are the avant -garde cialtrona dell'Egemonia 
 western; they place themselves beyond any truly universal value, 
 Perishing the cause of a hateful form of supremacy. The defense of 
 Israel is part of this ideological cage. They have eluded their own 
 rhetoric, combining cynical and instinct for conservation of 
 an hegemony that is already lost; mystification and sense of superiority: the 
 Worse, really.

        These

 constitutive of liberal-democracies, whose vital interests do not 
 They coincide with those of the peoples, but with class exclusivity. 
 The adjective "liberal" dominates the noun "democracy".

        The essence,
 here; of democracy. There's the democracy of privilege, and there's that democracy 
fairness. In the first, what has the most value is the market, the 
profit, business, all dimensions that produce inequalities and 
poverty; in the second, the overcoming of iniquities is at the heart of 
every action, its sole purpose.

        There 
  First, that of privileges is the democracy of the stock exchange, of 
 colonialism, the accentralization of wealth in a few hands, of 
 combination of politics and military industry; The second is democracy 
 of the "without properties", of peoples, of peace.

</span>
</span>
</p>
<p align="left">
<span>
<span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
<span>
        For 
  The first, the theft of resources serves to maintain privileges; and the 
  democracy that wants to export herself, not hesitating to bomb 
 other nations, invading lands not of his, violating the law 
 international. For the second, only the equality of peoples has value 
 positive, any part of the land inhabits.

</span>

</p>
<p align="left">
<span>

        There is
 the democracy of imperial interests, and there is that of the peoples. If the
 first makes the world a less free and safe place, the second has 
There is only one reason for existing: to get rid of the forces that promote the

 After all, a different idea is also at stake in the "Palestinian question" 
of democracy. The idea of a democracy that cannot coincide with the 
colonialism, military occupation or ethnic cleansing. Precisely because of the 
Today, democracy defends itself by countering the attitude of 
genocidal Israel.

<span>

<span>
        Everything is fine 
  speech that defends the instances of Israel and that justifies them to 
 behaviors is not only complicity with the genocide, but it is also - e 
 perhaps above all - a way of emptying the very idea of 
 democracy.
