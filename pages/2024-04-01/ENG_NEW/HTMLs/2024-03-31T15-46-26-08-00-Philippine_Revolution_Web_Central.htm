For the past 55 years our Red fighters  have fought the people's enemy with courage and honor.  They are the beloved warriors of the masses. We salute  their valor, render the highest honor and tribute to the  revolu�onary martyrs and heroes of the New People’s  Army, and offer our deepest gra�tude for the sacrifices  they have given to triumph against the enemy. The enemy always aims to destroy the revolu�onary  movement and halt the surge of people’s struggle. But  no coercive instrument of the state, no ma�er how brutal  and fascis�c, can stop the people from figh�ng for a new  social system. It is the brutal violence and intolerable  burden of exploita�on and oppression by the comprador  big bourgeoisie, landlords and monopoly capitalists that  drive the masses to persist in the struggle.  The greed of foreign and domes�c capitalists  dehumanizes the workers, peasants and all toiling  masses. The violence of exploita�on and oppression  against the masses that persists day a�er day, and the  criminal disregard for their abject poverty legi�mize the  justness of the people’s war and thus must be supported.  The Filipino people commit themselves to armed  revolu�on not because they glorify wars. They commit  to it because they understand that it is only through armed struggle that their aspira�ons for a just,  developed, and progressive society will be fulfilled.  For more than five decades, the revolu�onaries and the  masses have withstood the onslaughts of the enemy. The  hardships and sacrifices of the Filipino people and their  army have built a strong founda�on for the advance of  the na�onal democra�c revolu�on and the crea�on of  the People’s Democra�c Government.   Imperialism and the local reac�onaries may seem like a  formidable foe. But we have the people on the side of  revolu�on and once aroused, organized, and mobilized  in their millions, they become an invincible force. It is the  responsibility of the revolu�onary movement to  con�nue arousing, organizing and mobilizing the people  wherever they are.  Despite the huge number of the enemy forces, weaponry  and heavy support from US imperialism, the  revolu�onary movement has been able to counter and  defeat every strategic counterrevolu�onary plan  implemented by the regimes from Marcos Sr to Duterte.  The current Marcos Jr. regime's “oplans” will suffer the  same fate. The par�cipa�on and support of the masses for the  revolu�on are unwavering. Addi�onally, the  revolu�onary forces abroad, including Filipino migrants, <br><br>3are greatly inspired by the sacrifices of the New People’s  Army. Many have expressed their desire to fight  alongside the people’s warriors.  Indubitably, the boundless courage and daringness of  the masses and revolu�onary forces in the face of  sharpening class contradic�ons shall be kept in the  treasure chest of stories that inspire the revolu�onary  movement’s con�nued advance.    Rec�fica�on and Resurgence Building on its achievements and founded on the strong  support of the figh�ng masses, the Party has embarked  on a rec�fica�on movement to address its weaknesses  and errors and advance the people’s war to even greater  heights. This rec�fica�on movement strengthens and  unites the Party and the people along the correct  revolu�onary line and steels the figh�ng will and  capabili�es of the masses and the people’s army to face  the enemy. History has shown that revolu�on advances  when rec�fica�on is undertaken to correct errors and  implement tasks to further advance the people’s war,  and to prevent devia�ons from the principles of  Marxism-Leninism-Maoism that guide the people’s  democra�c revolu�on.  Resurgence in all aspects of work for the revolu�on  results from the rec�fica�on by the revolu�onary  movement. Analyzing and summing-up our work,  correc�ng errors and pu�ng stress on what must  immediately be done will energize comrades to fulfill  their responsibili�es and tasks.  People’s war is a necessary undertaking in the building  of the People’s Democra�c Government that responds  to the needs of the masses. The old social order must be  destroyed in order to build upon its rubble and ashes a  just, equitable, and pro-people system of governance.  Ours is a just war and the people’s war of the Filipino  people is bound for victory!IN THIS ISSUE Editorial: Victory is the only outcome of the  epic people’s war! |Page 2 Tactical Offensives | Page 4 A woman’s place is in the struggle | Page 6 New attempt at “Cha-Cha” exposes GRP's  rotten political and economic system | Page 7 People’s War Not Constitutional Change is  the True Answer to the Filipino People’s  Problems | Page 9 Marcos Jr. and Duterte stumble further  towards international isolation | Page 10 Creating freedom and writing the future for  our children | Page 12 Ka Joma Lives!

EDITORIAL BOARD Ma. Lourdes Barros Hugo Francisco Jose Emilio Jacinto III Ricardo Lozano Raya Andres – Montañosa  Ana Rosario LIBERATION INTERNATIONAL is a publication of the NDFP International Office Amsterdamsestraatweg 50, 3513 AG, Utrecht, The Netherlands Email us at contact@ndfp.org <br><br> 4“[T]he NPA makes them suffer casual�es and defeats through ambushes, raids, arrest  opera�ons, demoli�on work and other forms of  sabotage. The enemy is like a big monster that cannot protect its body parts  and is bleeding to death from many wounds.” — Jose Maria Sison, 2021 “Poli�cal power grows out of the barrel of a gun.” — Mao Tse Tung, 1927 In 2023, the New People’s Army (NPA) launched  numerous victorious tac�cal offensives causing the  fascist enemy to bleed with a thousand cuts.  Recently, the Narciso Antazo Aramil Command of NPA  - Rizal successfully ambushed the opera�ng troops of  the 80th IBPA in Lukutang Malaki, Barangay San Isidro,  Rodriguez, Rizal. More tac�cal offensives are certainly  in the offing.  How does the NPA, thus, prepare for a tac�cal offensive?  Libera�on Interna�onal, on the occasion of the New  People’s Army’s 55th anniversary, interviewed a Red  fighter to delve into the process of moun�ng an  offensive.  Pre-tac�cal offensive Before any tac�cal offensive (TO) is launched, it is  me�culously planned wherein several crucial elements  are primarily taken into account, such as poli�cal gain,  the masses’ gain, social inves�ga�on and class analysis  and the masses’ readiness. Based on these considera�ons, the responsible  command determines which kind of offensive befits the  masses’ and the NPA’s capaci�es, exis�ng poli�cal  situa�on and other security aspects.  A tac�cal offensive takes months to prepare, depending  on the size of an opera�on. For instance, big, annihila�ve  offensives entail a longer prepara�on as it involves  orienta�on and consolida�on of forces, stockpiling, and  iden�fying areas to retreat, to name a few. When it  comes to small ac�ons, a ‘window of opportunity’, for  example, the enemy passes by an area at a given �me,  prompts swi� prepara�ons. It also depends on the masses. Their determina�on and  asser�on can contribute to a swi�er prepara�on. More  importantly, without the masses’ unwavering support,  there would never be a successful tac�cal offensive.  They play a pivotal role in the en�re process—from  preparing the place, determining the places to retreat,  ensuring sufficient food and supply, inves�ga�ng the  security situa�on, and monitoring the movement of the  enemy, to knowing when to strike.  In carrying out all these tasks, the people’s mili�a units,  who act as local NPA units in the barrio, along with the  self-defense units of revolu�onary mass organiza�ons  are also mobilized.  Actual tac�cal offensive In all tac�cal offensives, every Red fighter deals with a  lot of tension and a lot of things play in their minds which  is but natural. The NPA though knows how to handle the  situa�on well. They li� each other’s morale, and keep  themselves focused on their objec�ve.  During the actual tac�cal offensive, a great deal of �me  is spent lying in wait, which can last up to three days or  even longer.  Once the opera�on is mounted, two things can  happen— either it is successful or not. OffensivesTacticalOffensives By Raya Andres - Montañosa<br><br> Primarily, a successful TO is measured by the extent of  damage inflicted on the enemy or the enemy’s reduced  figh�ng capability. The impact on the enemy is, thus,  more important than the sheer number of enemy  casual�es. T o illustrate, it is successful if a sizable number  of arms are seized from the enemy or if they lose their  morale, even if it is a minor tac�cal offensive, yielding  minimal or zero enemy casual�es.   Contrarily, the effect is the opposite if it is not successful.  If this happens (and in any situa�on), the most important  thing to do is to assess the results to form an objec�ve  analysis of the circumstances and to draw lessons. Also,  it is important to make the masses understand the  lessons from their own experiences, regardless of the  results of a tac�cal offensive. Abor�ng or stopping a tac�cal offensive can also  happen. One of the main reasons is the extent of harm  to the masses and the NPA. This usually happens when  the social inves�ga�on is incomplete, or the analysis of  the data gathered is wrong. Hence, the importance of  conduc�ng a thorough study and analysis to collect  informa�on on the enemy’s movements, their stop  points, the right �me to strike them and their  vulnerabili�es, among others. Post-tac�cal offensive When a tac�cal offensive is successful, the masses  certainly celebrate it. O�en�mes, even the masses who  live far from the revolu�onary mass base are delighted  upon hearing such successes. Resounding and victorious  tac�cal offensives have beneficial effects both on the  organized and non-organized masses. Whether an NPA opera�on is successful or not, enemy  retalia�on is always expected. If they can no longer  pursue the retrea�ng NPA, they are likely to retaliate  against the masses. Even in the preparatory stage, the  NPA and the masses prepare for retalia�on by ensuring  that the masses are ready to face the enemy’s threats,  in�mida�on, and harassment. In the areas where there  are organs of poli�cal power, revolu�onary mass  organiza�ons prepare for these retaliatory ac�ons  through role-playing. Under any circumstances, the  masses must realize that safeguarding each other and  refusing any a�empt to separate them from their  community is vital to protec�ng every one of them.   As for the NPA, the most important thing to do during  the retreat is to get the masses’ intelligence reports on  enemy movements. It is paramount to know, for  instance, the enemy’s entry point. If the enemy enters  the area, the masses communicate this to the NPA  immediately.  Some�mes, when the NPA retreats a�er a bigger  offensive, there is a team that stays behind to delay or  deliver another heavy blow to the enemy. The enemy,  who usually retaliates to exact revenge, is most  vulnerable during this �me.  The masses are again ac�vely involved in this process.  A�er a tac�cal offensive, the masses know that the red  fighters are �red and hungry. So, they carry their things  and keep safe the materials and some arms that are used  for the opera�on, as well as prepare and serve them  food. Next to giving intelligence reports, they also get  rid of any trace of NPA presence during the retreat to  prevent the enemy from loca�ng the NPA.<br><br> 6place is in the Strugglewoman'sA On the occasion of the Interna�onal Working  Women’s Day on March 8 and the 55th anniversary of  the New People’s Army, Libera�on Interna�onal offers  women Red fighters’ insights on building a  revolu�onary family in the context of waging an armed  revolu�on. Ka M: “As a mother, I try to a�end to my child’s needs  while fulfilling my du�es as a Red fighter. At the same  �me, we give our full trust to the masses to ensure the  safety of our children and that their needs are met.” “As partners, my husband and I are assigned to  different guerilla units located far away from each  other most of the �me. Thus, we make sure that our  requests for visits and reunions are put forward to our  respec�ve collec�ves in a �mely manner.” Ka Mabini: “First of all, it must be recognized that  society puts a heavy pressure on women, especially  mothers, that they must be responsible for their  children. Especially among the ranks of Red fighters, we  must overcome this preconceived no�on dictated by  society that the woman, the mother is confined only to  reproduc�ve roles. In this sense, it is important to  understand that the woman’s place is in the struggle.  For a Red fighter, it is not only your own child’s welfare  that counts when it comes to decision-making. As an  NPA and Party member, we serve the revolu�on to  secure the future not only of our own children but for  Philippine society as a whole. Most of the �me, we  cannot be with our children, who are usually taken care  of by the masses since we are in the midst of a people’s  war. Any NPA member has the right to have a family, but it  is important to put this in the context of waging a  revolu�on. This means that we are in the context of  war where the NPA’s duty as well as the welfare of the  Party and the en�re revolu�onary movement prevail  over and guide the process of raising a revolu�onary  family.”<br><br> 7 By Jose Emilio Jacinto III Another a�empt to change the 1987 GRP cons�tu�on  (charter change or cha-cha) is currently underway and  has been triggering unrest among the people and within  the ro�en ruling system.  Cha-cha's have been a�empted by every GRP regime  a�er Cory Aquino. The 1987 Cons�tu�on was framed  precisely to prevent another Marcos dictatorship (the  GRP president is limited to  one six-year term). Despite  its reac�onary character, the 1987 GRP Cons�tu�on has  a clear commitment to patrio�sm and social jus�ce, and  it declared the Philippines nuclear-free. These a�empts followed the same script and ended in  failure because of the preeminence of the selfish poli�cal  objec�ves of those holding power to perpetuate  themselves. The move to change the cons�tu�on began a few weeks  ago in early January 2024, when a nondescript YouTube  video was posted poking fun at the 1986 “EDSA people  power revolu�on,” which ousted the fascist dictator  Ferdinand Marcos, father of Ferdinand Marcos Jr. A so-called people's ini�a�ve started a week later,  collec�ng signatures from the barrios and communi�es  to amend certain provisions in the 1987 cons�tu�on,  which cha-cha proponents blame as the cause of the  country's underdevelopment. A people's ini�a�ve is a scheme that purportedly allows Filipinos to directly  propose amendments to the Cons�tu�on, without  requiring congressional ac�on.  A joint House and Senate resolu�on has been filed to  form both chambers into a cons�tuent assembly to  amend several ar�cles in the GRP cons�tu�on allowing  foreigners full ownership of public u�li�es, educa�onal  ins�tu�ons, and adver�sing, among others. However, progressive people's organiza�ons, poli�cal  opposi�on, and the church have argued and stood  strongly against cha-cha's revival. They assert that far  from being the solu�on to the Philippines’  underdevelopment, it is in fact being railroaded to  extend the term limit of Ferdinand Marcos Jr. According to Bagong Alyansang Makabayan (Bayan), this  revival of cha-cha is no different from the a�empts of  previous regimes to use it for their selfish poli�cal  ambi�ons. The cha-cha revival is in fact ini�ated by  Marcos Jr.'s cousin, Speaker of the House of  Representa�ves Mar�n Romualdez, who reportedly  spent Php20M per district (about USD350,000) to buy  the signatures of the people. The Philippines has around  253 congressional districts. Bayan argues that apart from its ul�mate goal of  removing term limits of elected officials, cha-cha will New attempt at “Cha-Cha”  exposes GRP's rotten political  and economic system<br><br>8further open the economy to foreign plunder and  exploita�on and the return of permanent US military  bases in the Philippines. According to Bayan, this is the  reason why the US is also behind the Marcos Jr.  government in this ini�a�ve. Blaming the 1987 cons�tu�on for the roots of the  country's problems is covering-up the reality of  unbridled bureaucra�c corrup�on, feudal and  semifeudal exploita�on and imperialist control of the  poli�cal and economic system of the country, Bayan  emphasizes.  The GRP has been consistent in covering up these  problems when talking peace with the revolu�onary  movement and blaming the armed resistance as the  cause of the country's poverty and underdevelopment.  It has tried to trip the revolu�onary movement to  surrender to the GRP cons�tu�on. In fact, the cha-cha  a�empts show that the GRP wants to mu�late its own  cons�tu�on. During the 38th anniversary of the EDSA uprising,  thousands marched in the Philippines and overseas to  protest Marcos Jr.’s scheme to change the charter. They  organized a broad network opposed to changing the  1987 Cons�tu�on, which bans poli�cal dynas�es, sets  term limits for public officials and provides other guarantees to ensure that the state has “checks and  balances,”  and prohibits 100% foreign ownership of  land, key infrastructure, strategic industries and facili�es  in the Philippines. The broad opposi�on network against cha-cha also  asserted that instead of focusing on wrecking the  cons�tu�on, the GRP should address the people’s  demands for wage increases, lower prices, and be�er  social services. They also called for resolving the anomalous 2022  elec�ons which installed Marcos Jr. and Duterte. As the Marcos Jr. regime remains determined to push  for cha-cha despite the failures of previous a�empts and  amidst the Filipino people's resistance, the people's  militant democra�c movement and its poli�cal allies  must intensify their vigilance in opposing and figh�ng  further moves of the regime to perpetuate itself in power  and allow further imperialist intrusion into the country's  economy and poli�cs.  This current push for cha-cha has only exposed the ruling  bureaucrat capitalists’ drive to perpetuate themselves  in power, further sell the country's sovereignty and  integrity to imperialists, and desecrate the people's  fundamental rights and freedoms.<br><br> 9COMPATRIOTS-NDF, the revolu�onary  organiza�on of Filipinos overseas and a  member of the Na�onal Democra�c Front of  the Philippines (NDFP), believes that the  Philippine Cons�tu�on is a worthless piece of  paper that legi�mizes and jus�fies oppression and exploita�on of the Filipino people in a  semicolonial, semifeudal society ruled by US  imperialism, bureaucrat capitalism and  feudalism.  All Cons�tu�ons (1934 and 1943) that had  been in effect since the United States’ crea�on  of a so-called Philippine Commonwealth, then  followed by the Philippine Republic, were  imposed on the Filipino people to legi�mize its  neocolonial rule. The 1973 Cons�tu�on or  Marcos Cons�tu�on, which replaced the pre- WWII cons�tu�ons, made President Ferdinand  Marcos Sr. a one-man ruler. The cons�tu�on  that Marcos implemented made him a dictator  and allowed him to stay in power longer  through the declara�on of Mar�al Law. The Filipino people’s an�-dictatorship struggle  led to the ouster of Marcos in 1986, paving the  way for the Corazon Aquino government and its  1987 Cons�tu�on, which included some  favorable provisions such as the ban on nuclear  and foreign military bases, limi�ng foreign  ownership to 40%, an�-poli�cal dynasty and  term limits for elected officials including the  president. These provisions had been the  subject of many devious a�empts by previous  puppet regimes to amend them.  Marcos Jr. and his allies in his ruling class  fac�on are behind the moves to revise the  1987 Cons�tu�on. He aims to �nker with this  piece of paper with changes that will enthrone  his family and cronies once more in perpetuity while ensuring the support of US imperialism by  allowing the la�er and its allies to plunder our  resources and complete the annexa�on of the  Philippine archipelago as its military base in the  looming inter-imperialist shoo�ng war with  China. The oppressed and exploited classes and  sectors of the Philippine society have all the  reasons to oppose Marcos Jr.’s Charter Change.  Compatriots-NDF believes that the people’s  opposi�on against Charter Change is growing  and will succeed as it is linked and raised to the  an�-imperialist, an�-bureaucrat capitalist, and  an�-fascist struggle.  We call on the Filipino People to expose and  oppose the Marcos Jr. Regime as US  imperialism’s new tyrant at the helm of the  puppet government of the Philippines. Any  changes to the current 1987 Cons�tu�on of  the Republic of the Philippines only aim to  consolidate and perpetuate the power of the  ruling classes of bourgeois compradors, big  landlords, and the bureaucrat capitalist state,  and favor the con�nued plunder and war- mongering agenda of its US imperialist master.  No amendment to the current neocolonial  Cons�tu�on will provide relief or salva�on to  the Filipino masses from poverty, des�tu�on,  and oppression. The Filipino people’s na�onal  democra�c revolu�on is the only and true  solu�on to the fundamental economic, poli�cal,  and socio-cultural problems of the Filipino  people.  Onward with the People’s War!  Defeat Imperialism!  Advance the People’s Democra�c Revolu�on! People’s War Not Constitutional Change  is the True Answer to the Filipino  People’s Problems Statement of COMPATRIOTS-NDF (Revolu�onary Organiza�on of Overseas Filipinos and Families)<br><br>Marcos Jr. and Duterte stumble  further towards international  isolation<br><br>“seemingly unchecked powers” due to the An�-T error  Act, which was passed into law during Duterte’s �me.  The UN experts expressed “serious concern about the  seemingly broad and unchecked execu�ve  powers…par�cularly the discre�on of the An�-T errorism  Council to designate individuals and organiza�ons as  ‘terrorists’ and the An�-Money Laundering Council to  adopt targeted financial sanc�ons therea�er.”  The le�er was signed by Fionnuala Ni Aolain, special  rapporteur on human rights while countering terrorism;  Irene Khan, special rapporteur on the promo�on and  protec�on of the right to freedom of opinion and  expression; Clement Nyaletsossi Voule, special  rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful  assembly and of associa�on; Mary Lawlor, special  rapporteur on the situa�on of human rights defenders;  José Francisco Cali Tzay, special rapporteur on the rights  of indigenous peoples; and Nazila Ghanea, special  rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief. In July 2023, the Interna�onal Criminal Court (ICC)  rejected an a�empt by the Duterte camp to block an  inves�ga�on into the thousands killed during Duterte’s  so-called ‘war on drugs.’ Following the ICC’s  announcement, Marcos Jr. stated that his regime would  not cooperate with the ICC inves�ga�ons claiming the  interna�onal court has no jurisdic�on in the Philippines. By refusing to cooperate with the ICC,  Marcos Jr. lays  bare his culpability in shielding the Duterte regime’s  reign of state terror that killed 30,000 people and  vic�mized the Filipino toiling masses for six long years. It can be recalled that this series of diploma�c incidents  hounding the reac�onary regime was preceded by a  falling out between the Marcos Jr. and Duterte ruling  fac�ons. First triggered by conflict over the bureaucra�c  loot in the controversial ‘confiden�al funds’ of the Office  of the Vice President (OVP) Sara Duterte (daughter of  Rodrigo Duterte), the feud between the two ruling  cliques has developed into exple�ve-laden exchanges.  Earlier this year, Rodrigo Duterte called out Marcos Jr.  for plo�ng to amend the cons�tu�on to li� the  president’s term limits. He also accused Marcos Jr. of  being a drug addict. In turn, Marcos Jr. responded by  saying Duterte was fond of using fentanyl, a powerful  opioid drug.  The worsening crisis of the semicolonial and semifeudal  system in the Philippines has not only sharpened the  contradic�ons between the Marcos Jr. and Duterte  ruling cliques but has also intensified the people’s  resistance against neoliberal offensives and increasing  fascism  by the current regime. The unprecedented level  of crisis and repression unfolding is only bound to worsen  Marcos Jr. and Duterte’s isola�on from the Filipino  masses and from the interna�onal community.<br><br> 12 CREATING FREEDOM  AND WRITING THE  FUTURE FOR OUR  CHILDREN An interview with Dahoud Shebab, Spokesperson of the  Islamic Jihad in Gaza by the Liberation staff  Through the help of friends from the interna�onal media, the  Libera�on staff was able to send a set of ques�ons to the Pales�nian  resistance movement based in Gaza. The ques�ons focused on the  reasons why the October 7 military ac�on against Israeli forces was  launched, the unity of various groups and forces in Pales�ne, the vision  of a free Pales�ne, and the lessons the world could learn from the  Pales�nians as they wage their war of libera�on and self- determina�on.  The Islamic Jihad is among the various groups within the Pales�nian  Forces Alliance, which includes Hamas, Popular Front for the  Libera�on of Pales�ne, Popular Struggle Front, Pales�nian Libera�on  Front, Vanguard for the Popular Libera�on War-Ligh�ng Forces, and  the Fatah Al-In�fada Movement. <br><br>13Below is the transcript and transla�on of the video interview with Dahoud Shebab.  Minor copy edi�ng was done for this print version.       Libera�on: What was the immediate trigger of the October 7 a�ack against the Israeli  government? Is there a strategic goal behind this? Dahoud Shebab (DS):  October 7 was an expression of the angry Pales�nian  rejec�on of all forms of repression and terrorism by Israel over many years against  the Pales�nian people. October 7 is not isolated from the rest of the Pales�nian  resistance before October 7. We must say that the Pales�nian resistance is about defending its land and  defending its people. The resistance is not a group of killers and killing in itself is  not the goal. It is not to cause a state of destruc�on and ruins. Rather, it seeks to  pressure the occupa�on and use legi�mate means to raise its voice to the world  and deliver its message, especially in the light of Israel's complete denial of the  rights of the Pales�nian people and the con�nued Israeli a�acks on the Al-Aqsa  Mosque, Jerusalem, the West Bank; Israel's con�nuous viola�ons of prisoners'  rights; and the con�nuing siege of the Gaza Strip. All these were done by Israel  without anyone in the world doing anything to stop them. We have been warning and sending messages to mediators, all par�es, and the  United Na�ons that Israeli policies will lead to a major escala�on and an explosion  of the situa�on. Before, we witnessed great aggression by Israel. There was killing  of Pales�nians at checkpoints in the West Bank in cold blood. Every day there were  vic�ms. Did anyone look at those vic�ms? No. No one looked.  Came October 7. The aim was to tell Israel and send a message to the whole world  that the Pales�nian resistance can cause instability if Israel con�nues its terrorism  and aggression; and that it is not only the Pales�nian people who will pay the price  for Israel's crimes. Se�lers, the whole region and the whole world may pay the  price. All stability will be undermined if Israel con�nues its a�acks. L: Did you an�cipate Israel’s counter-a�ack to be in this magnitude?  DS: We are aware that Israel is a brutal, bloody and criminal state, especially this  extremist government. We know what they can do. But we did not know that the  Israeli government does not care about its prisoners and soldiers in the Gaza Strip.  That it can even resort to killing them if only to ensure that this leadership or the  Israeli fascist government achieves poli�cal and electoral gains in its internal  compe��ons. Israel has even ignored the humanitarian calls made by the  Pales�nian resistance since day one of this ba�le for the release of civilian  prisoners or civilian detainees for humanitarian reasons. We have said this and called for it. Hamas has also called for it. However, Israel  has not paid a�en�on and has con�nued to carry out criminal and bloody bombing  and destruc�on that has made vic�ms even of Israeli civilians and foreign  na�onali�es. Israel did not care at all for its civilian prisoners, not even the military  personnel in the hands of the Pales�nian resistance. Indiscriminate and destruc�ve shelling occurred whether there were Israeli  prisoners, foreign na�onals, or others. En�re neighborhoods were exterminated  with its residents, civilians, or prisoners held by the Pales�nian resistance. Israel  showed no respect even for minimum humanitarian and moral values in the Gaza  Strip, especially in the areas of Gaza governorate and in northern Gaza. L: What is the vision of a free Pales�ne? What do you intend to do with Israeli residents  who were already born and residing in Israel for so long? DS: To be clear, all this land is for Pales�nians and like any country in the world,  when we take full rights and sovereignty over our land, then the government  chosen by the Pales�nian people can decide how to deal with foreign expatriates,  whether Jews or non-Jews. We have no problem with Jews; we have no problem with anyone. Our problem  is with Israeli Zionists who occupied our land. We have posi�ve and good rela�ons <br><br>14with many Jews in the world. They never believe in occupa�on. They reject the  occupa�on. We have no problem with them. The problem is with Israeli Zionists who came and occupied our land and  established a state on our land. Now when we take the right to our land and be  liberated, we can choose our own government. This government, like any  government in the world, can decide on these na�onals: grant them na�onali�es  or not grant them. The problem is that Israel is the occupier. We, therefore, treat the Israeli people  as occupying our land. They are all occupiers, but upon our libera�on, we will  decide on it. Like any country in the world, you decide on it.  This ma�er applies to different countries of the world as well. Also, why is it  permissible for a group of countries, such as NATO member states, to establish  an alliance with each other and have joint defense agreement but other  countries could not?  This is a natural right that Pales�ne exercises when it, too,  has entered an alliance with other countries such as Iran, Yemen, Iraq, Lebanon,  and other countries or other powers, to support the cause of the Pales�nian  people. L: An alliance of different resistance movements is now formed, are there other  poli�cal forces working at a different direc�on? How was this unity achieved?  DS: We welcome any party that wants to support us as Pales�nians and we will  not stand against it. But it is important that there is no interference in our  policies and in our method of work. That is, no one should intervene. The  Pales�nian resistance has independent posi�ons and are not linked to any  foreign agendas as claimed by the Israeli occupa�on and other countries that  support it. We aim to achieve a more comprehensive Pales�nian unity. Today, we are more confident than ever before in our ability to achieve internal  Pales�nian reconcilia�on. The great plight of the Pales�nian people today as a  result of the Israeli aggression requires building true unity, especially as some  countries are trying to interfere in our affairs and imposing the form and method  of managing ourselves. We know how to manage ourselves and know how to  decide our des�ny. We will never accept interference from any external party. Our Arab brothers have many things in common. We all are in consensus on  what things may be like in the coming days, and we will not allow Israel to impose  on us the form, administra�on, and method of governance in the next phase. L: What could possibly threaten this unity? DS: Israel is the constant threat to Pales�nian unity. Israel, which kills the sons of Fatah, the sons of Hamas, the Islamic Jihad, the  PFLP (Popular Front for the Libera�on of Pales�ne) and the DFLP (Democra�c  Front for the Libera�on of Pales�ne-Marxist Leninist organiza�on) and kills all  the Pales�nian people in the West Bank. Israel is the most serious threat to  internal Pales�nian unity. It has always been a major obstacle to achieving  Pales�nian unity.  Today, everyone is fully aware that there is no future for a se�lement with Israel  and that Israel is a bloody, criminal, and terrorist en�ty. In the long term, we  believe that this convic�on will promote greater efforts to overcome internal  poli�cal differences and lead to building a true Pales�nian unity created by the  Pales�nians. This is a right exercised by all occupied na�ons and subjected to aggression but  won their independence at the end. There is no occupa�on that lasts forever,  not in all human history. We seek our freedom. Therefore, our vision is despite all Israeli threats our resistance will be further  strengthened. Israel will not be able to end the resistance, because as long as  there is an occupa�on, the resistance will remain. This is a natural thing, and we  are confident that we are closer to victory.<br><br>15L: The struggle of the Pales�nians is now at the center  stage of the world, gathering millions of supporters.  Would you consider this a poli�cal victory? DS: The whole world today is looking at the  Pales�nian people, the injus�ce done to them and  the need for the Pales�nian people to exercise their  rights. We are commi�ed to use all our rights  throughout our land. This is what we hope to  achieve.  Today, there is a great deal of empathy and support  for the Pales�nian people, including Arabs,  foreigners and people of all races and ethnici�es.  There is great sympathy for the Pales�nian cause.  There is great support for the right of the  Pales�nian people to resist, regardless of the  posi�ons of the colonial countries.  We do not expect anything from Britain, for  example, or the Bri�sh government. Britain is  known to be a colonizing country. France is a  colonizing country. The United States of America is  the main sponsor of all the chaos that prevails in the  world. It created chaos in Iraq, in Afghanistan, in  Pakistan and in other countries. The American  experiments—even when America wanted to create  governments in its own mold—failed miserably and  put these countries into misery, and their future  became sorry and uncertain.  L: Having demonstrated the higher unity and capacity  for waging this war of libera�on, what are the  prospects now? DS: People always create their freedom with their  own hands. Today, the Pales�nian people have  decided to create their freedom and write the future  of their children by their own hands. We defend the future of our children in future  genera�ons. They should live a decent, safe and  stable life like other peoples of the world. But to remain under siege and suffer the injus�ce  prac�ced against us by Israel, and to remain hostage  to the policies of starva�on and killing -- all of this  must stop.  Yes, today we are making great sacrifices. But these  sacrifices will be a light of hope for a real bright  future for the next genera�ons.  Today, the world faces the test of whether to be  loyal and honest with itself, and to take sides with  these values and principles, which were the result  of a great deal of wars and bloody, deadly and  destruc�ve conflicts. L: What is your take on the role of Israel’s allies and  supporters? DS: We must see the United States of America for  what it really is. It is not a civiliza�on, it has not  created civiliza�on, it has not created stability, but  instead has created ways for itself to dominate the  whole world. Today is the �me for the world to be  free from American domina�on, from slavery to the  US dollar, and for the world to take sides with  jus�ce. There can be no jus�ce in the light of the con�nued  occupa�on of the land of Pales�ne, the occupa�on  of the Pales�nian people, and the con�nued  suffering of the Pales�nian people among the other  peoples of the world who are also suffering as a  result of American and Western colonial policies. The whole world is a vic�m of the policies of Europe  and America's colonial policies. They plundered the  world's wealth, destroyed the environment,  destroyed the world economy, and dominated  poli�cal affairs. Today, there is a true awakening in many countries  and peoples in the world, and must be strengthened  and must con�nue.<br><br> 16Kamil “Ka Alex” Manangan was raised in a pe�y- bourgeoise upbringing and a na�ve of Punta, Sta.  Ana, Manila. She studied Business Administra�on at  the Polytechnic University of the Philippines (PUP)  where she ac�vely par�cipated in a young women  students’ organiza�on and engaged in poli�cal work  among her fellow students. During her organizing work in the urban area, Ka  Alex quickly realized the necessity of the na�onal  democra�c revolu�on and understood that armed  struggle was the only means to fully liberate  Philippine society.  She was among the many young revolu�onaries  who responded to the call of the Third Rec�fica�on  Movement for the youth to join the armed  revolu�on in the countryside. A�er a�ending the  Party’s anniversary celebra�on in Batangas in 2016,  she decided to stay in the New People’s Army for  six months a�er which she  commi�ed to becoming  a full-�me Red fighter under the NPA-Batangas  Eduardo Dagli Command.  Due to her excep�onal skills, Ka Alex quickly rose  through the ranks and became a poli�cal guide  within her unit. She par�cipated in military  opera�ons, including a raid on Henry Sy’s security  forces in Pico De Loro resort in Batangas. She  disguised herself as an officer from the Department  of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) and  served as a lookout. Ka Alex was happy and proud  to have been part of this historic puni�ve opera�on  against the Sy Family, owners of the Shoemart Malls  and chain of department stores and one of the  biggest comprador bourgeoisie families, who  grabbed thousands of hectares of land from the  peasants in Batangas. A�er this breakthrough experience, Ka Alex was  assigned to do mass work where she served as a  deputy poli�cal instructor for her platoon forma�on  in the town of Lian. She led propaganda and mass educa�on work within their area of responsibility. Ka Alex’s city-life upbringing was totally different  from the life of a guerrilla fighter in the countryside.  Yet, she would o�en tell her comrades how all her  physical exhaus�on would suddenly disappear  whenever she talked with the masses about their  daily lives and hardships.  Her determina�on was tested once more in a  defensive encounter in Barangay Lumaniag where  she and two other Red Fighters, Ka Jessie and Ka  Zac, got separated from their unit. She valiantly  withdrew her two wounded comrades and ensured  their safety. Undeterred by their predicament, she  went to nearby houses of the masses to seek help.  She did not know the masses in the area, but she  used her propaganda skills and experience in mass  work to gain their trust. The masses eventually  decided to help them by giving medicine, food,  lending clothes and providing a phone to contact  the others for back up. Ka Alex once again demonstrated her strength  when the fascist AFP (Armed Forces of the  Philippines) troops were closing in on the house  where they were staying. She raised the morale of  her wounded comrades by singing “Tigreng Papel”   (Paper Tiger) and repeatedly reci�ng the Party’s  oath: “I pledge…to safeguard the security of the  Party and all my comrades at the cost of my life if  necessary…”  Even a�er her harrowing experience in the face of  the enemy troops, Ka Alex showed no signs of  retreat or regret. Her experience in the ba�lefield  only further strengthened her determina�on.  When Ka Alex became a full-�me Red fighter, she  was elected as a member of the Party’s front  commi�ee. A�er a few months, she was assigned as  a poli�cal guide for her squad and later as deputy  poli�cal instructor for her platoon and logis�cs  officer for her unit. Throughout her �me in the NPA,  she demonstrated excep�onal zeal in poli�cal work  both among the people’s army and the masses.‘Women who struggle  are women who can  never be defeated’ Remembering the life of Kamil “Ka Alex” Manangan by Atan Dominguez<br><br>Ka Alex dedicated her talent and abili�es to  do painstaking mass work and touched the  lives of hundreds of peasant families in  Batangas.  As an exemplary revolu�onary woman who  gave up a comfortable life in the city to be  with the masses she vowed to serve, Ka Alex  will always be remembered as a hard- working, gentle, and forward-thinking  comrade.  She will always be remembered for  always quo�ng Mao’s words: “The women  who struggle are the women who can never  be defeated.” Ka Alex lived by these words  un�l her very last breath. She was martyred  alongside 13 others on November 28, 2017,  in an encounter with the mercenary AFP-PNP  troops in Nasugbu, Batangas. Although Ka Alex’s �me in the people’s army  may have been short, her life carries profound  significance for the masses she served. The  strength of her commitment and enthusiasm  for revolu�onary work is an eternal source of  inspira�on for the youth and women  revolu�onaries who persevere in advancing  the people’s war.<br><br> 18 Libera�on Interna�onal: The GRP has asserted that any  possibility of opening the peace nego�a�ons would be a  ‘restart’ of the whole process, including the framework of  the nego�a�ons. Will the NDFP Peace Panel table this as  a first item (the framework) in ini�al discussions when both  panels meet face to face? Julie de Lima :  We are not for a ‘restart’ but for a  resump�on of peace nego�a�ons. As the first item when  we meet with the GRP team in April, it will be the  discussion on the framework of the peace nego�a�ons.   The Hague Joint Declara�on as the framework for peace  nego�a�ons has resulted in several substan�ve  agreements, the most important of which are the Joint  Agreement on Safety and Immunity Guarantees (JASIG)  and the Comprehensive Agreement on the Respect for  Human Rights and Interna�onal Humanitarian Law  (CARHRIHL).  We cannot consign these to the waste  basket. Both the GRP and the NDFP have put in a lot of  painstaking and deliberate effort in the course of 36  years. Thus, we will insist on discussing the reaffirma�on  of all previous signed agreements. LI: When the Duterte regime scu�led the talks in 2017,  both panels have been engaged in discussions on the  comprehensive agreement on social and economic  reforms, considered to be the “heart and soul” of the  nego�a�ons. Has this substan�al ma�er ever been  men�oned or discussed in framing the statement  recognizing the “serious socioeconomic and environmental  issues” facing the Philippines? JL:  I made a brief presenta�on of the NDFP dra� CASER  at a mee�ng with the GRP team in March 2023.  We  meant this to be among the serious socioeconomic and  environmental issues facing our country.  But we did not  have an in-depth discussion on this with the GRP team. LI: This year will be the 26th year since the Comprehensive  Agreement on the Respect for Human Rights and  Interna�onal Humanitarian Law (CARHRIHL) was signed  by the GRP and the NDFP. In light of recent and con�nuous  reports of aerial bombings, killings and massacres against  peasants, ac�vists and hors de combat in the Philippine  countryside, how can the broad interna�onal solidarity for the Philippine revolu�onary movement hold the GRP  accountable for its war crimes? JL:  The current Ferdinand Marcos Jr. regime can be held  accountable for viola�ons of the CARHRIHL, which the  government co-signed with the NDFP.  But since these  acts cons�tute war crimes, he can also be held to  account under the Nuremberg principles. Like Duterte,  Marcos Jr. can also be charged under the terms of the  Interna�onal Criminal Court. Other avenues including  quasi-legal courts of public opinion can also form the  basis of future legal ac�ons to hold Marcos Jr. and  Duterte for their war crimes. LI: What would the NDFP consider as the most  fundamental and substan�al item that needs to be  urgently addressed in its dra� of the agreement on social  and economic reforms? JL:  The most fundamental items that need discussing  are agrarian reform, rural development and na�onal  industrializa�on.  These form the founda�on of the  na�onal economy and are the keys to ending poverty  and joblessness in the country and ensuring economic  growth. LI: GRP factotums have voiced nervous concerns about the  CPP's current rec�fica�on movement, even saying that  intensifying the people's war runs counter to the “spirit” of  the peace nego�a�ons, are there bases for them to have  cold feet? Would there be implica�ons for the peace talks,  as they imply? JL:  The CPP’s current rec�fica�on movement is sure to  revitalize and lead to the resurgence of the revolu�on  which in turn compels the GRP to address the root  causes of armed conflict. Of course, the enemies of the  people would be concerned about this.  LI: Should the formal peace talks be convened again soon,  is the NDFP ready with its peace nego�a�ng panel? JL: The GRP has a long track record of undermining the  NDFP Peace Nego�a�ng Panel by targe�ng NDFP  consultants and nego�ators in clear viola�on of JASIG. HARDTALK: ‘WE ARE NOT FOR A  ‘RESTART’ BUT FOR A RESUMPTION OF PEACE NEGOTIATIONS’ Liberation International interview with Julieta de Lima, Chairperson, NDFP Peace Negotiating Panel<br><br>19On the second year of the fascist Marcos Jr. regime, the  toiling women con�nue to par�cipate in the armed and  unarmed forms of struggle to advance the people’s  na�onal democra�c revolu�on! The intense oppression and exploita�on of women in a  semicolonial and semifeudal society strengthen and  expand the membership of revolu�onary mass  organiza�ons such the Makabayang Kilusan ng Bagong  Kababaihan (Patrio�c Movement of New Women- MAKIBAKA). Majority of women belong to the poorest strata of  society, workers, farmers, indigenous and urban poor.  S�ll to recover from the widespread loss of jobs, falling  incomes, and inflated prices of goods and u�li�es caused  by the pandemic, the Marcos Jr. regime intensifies  women’s impoverishment through the con�nued  implementa�on of neoliberal agreements and policies. Marcos Jr.’s subservience to his US imperialist master is  blatant in the form of US-directed changes to the  country’s economic policies. In his current a�empt to  amend the 1987 Cons�tu�on via Charter Change,  Marcos Jr. further opens the country’s economy to  foreign investments in favor of imperialist profiteering.Decades of neoliberal policies implemented in the  Philippines have not resulted in any material  development for the people and for the economy.   Instead, trade deficits persist and the country’s economy  is constantly dependent on remi�ances from overseas  workers and from constant foreign borrowing. In the  past two years alone, the administra�on has incurred  Php1.82 trillion debt. In 2023, debt levels have reached  a total of Php14.62 trillion. Women and the rest of the  masses will surely bear the burden of paying these debts  for genera�ons to come. Because the country’s economy is �ed to the global  capitalist system, the crisis of imperialism has a direct  impact on the jobs and livelihood of the Filipino people.  As the crisis intensifies, so does the capitalist  exploita�on of the masses. The three biggest apparel  manufacturers that comprise 60% of the country’s total  garment exports implemented mass layoffs between  2019-2024 wherein an es�mated 80,000 women  workers lost their jobs. This was a�er the capitalists  issued a pull-out order from the Philippines and transfer  produc�on to other countries such as Vietnam and  Cambodia where labor is much cheaper. The severe exploita�on of the working-class Filipina  con�nues due to contractualiza�on, various forms of Statement of Makabayang Kilusan ng Bagong  Kababaihan (MAKIBAKA)  on International  Working Women’s Day, March 8, 2024Nevertheless, I expect that the Nego�a�ng Panel would  be completed as soon as the formal peace nego�a�ons  start. LI: How do you foresee the conduct of the peace  nego�a�ons in an�cipa�on that most GRP panel  representa�ves would be coming mostly from the Armed  Forces of the Philippines? JL:  We just have to wait and see how they conduct  themselves in the peace nego�a�ons.  General Ramos,  a military man, when he became president enabled the  GRP Nego�a�ng Panel to make progress in the peace  nego�a�ons.  As a ma�er of fact, the most substan�ve  agreements were made during his term. Just as it was in  Ramos’ �me when many substan�ve agreements were  made, it was also the military that scu�led the talks at  the �me of Cory, Gloria, Noynoy and Digong. Therefore,  it is the seriousness and readiness to engage that the GRP and its principal approach to the peace talks that  ma�ers more than the composi�on of the panel.  LI: Should the previous agreements already made in the  past rounds of peace talks be ‘negated’ , would there s�ll be  basis for the NDFP to con�nue engaging in the  nego�a�ons? JL: It is the responsibility of both par�es to recognize the  agreements made during the course of the peace  nego�a�ons since Cory Aquino’s �me because these  agreements were signed by legi�mate representa�ves  of both par�es. Regardless of who is appointed to each  nego�a�ng panel at whichever point in �me, the  effec�vity of such agreements must be recognized in  order for the peace nego�a�ons to proceed consistent  with the framework provided for by the Hague Joint  Declara�on. Should the GRP disregard these  agreements, then there would be no point for the NDFP  to pursue the peace nego�a�ons.<br><br> 20labor flexibiliza�on, low wages, dangerous working  condi�ons, discrimina�on, and violence. The increasing  number of unemployed workers contributes to the  crea�on of a large reserve army of labor that further  depresses wages and perpetuates contractualiza�on.  The current minimum wage remains grossly insufficient  and unlivable especially in the provinces. Minimum wage  in the Na�onal Capital Region (NCR) is only Php610  (approximately 10USD) while it is only Php316  (approximately 6USD) in the Bangsamoro Autonomous  Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM). In rural areas, women remain among the most  disadvantaged groups among fisherfolk, farmers and  indigenous peoples. For decades, rural women have  been suffering from severe and consistent economic  losses and hunger due to widespread landlessness and  the lack of state support for local agricultural produc�on. The reac�onary state has failed in all of its a�empts to  implement agrarian reform. Since the implementa�on of  Masagana ‘99 in 1972 by Marcos Sr., the Comprehensive  Agrarian Reform Program (CARP) in 1988 by Cory  Aquino, and the subsequent CARP Extension with  Reforms by Arroyo in 2009, the reac�onary state has  only protected the landlords and their haciendas that  should have been distributed to the farmers a long �me  ago. In 2021, there are s�ll 540,000 hectares of  distributable land under CARP that have not yet been  distributed. Widespread neoliberal economic reforms are causing  widespread joblessness among farmers and  farmworkers. Due to the impacts of liberaliza�on, highly  subsidized foreign agricultural products are flooding the  country resul�ng in losses for small-scale producers.  They are instead forced to sell their products at cheaper  prices, despite the high market prices of rice and other  basic food commodi�es.  The emergence of revolu�onary women's organiza�ons  in the countryside is caused by the starva�on of farmers, who are the producers of the people's food. In the  absence of agricultural support from the state, coupled  with state-sponsored violence, the reac�onary  government itself is pushing rural women to par�cipate  in armed struggle.  Because the feudal-patriarchal society �es women to  housework as the primary caregiver of the family,  women are among the first to be affected by sky-high  commodity prices and unlivable wages. Women who  demand the right to a living wage and a safe workplace  are in�midated, fired, arrested, and raped. In the  provinces, workers are no longer allowed to work in  nearby factories simply because they are unionized or  are members of a worker’s associa�on. In this situa�on, women's par�cipa�on in social and  na�onal libera�on to free themselves con�nue. The  severe economic and poli�cal crises are pushing them  to organize fellow women, par�cipate and lead mass  struggles such as in pickets, land occupa�ons and  people's strikes, and take the revolu�onary path of  armed struggle. T ogether with all who are oppressed and exploited, it is  necessary for the Filipina women to destroy imperialism,  bureaucra�c capitalism, and feudalism so that they can  all be free. Highest tribute to all the revolu�onary women martyrs  who sacrificed their lives for the victory of the people's  war! Long live MAKIBAKA! Long live the na�onal democra�c revolu�on! Long live the unity of women and people of the world  against imperialism! (This is an abridged version of the original MAKIBAKA  statement in Filipino translated to English by Ana Rosario.)<br><br> 21 KA JOMA LIVES!  STUDY MOVEMENT:  IMMORTALIZING  KA JOMA’S LEGACY  The passing of beloved comrade, Ka Jose Maria  Sison, fondly called Ka Joma, on December 16,  2022, gave birth to a movement that serves to  immortalize his legacy and propagate his works and  teachings to the Philippines and the world.  Launched by the revolu�onary movement in the  Philippines and abroad, Ka Joma Lives! is a dynamic  and vibrant study movement that conducts  campaigns and ac�vi�es that commemorate his life  and contribu�ons to the Philippine na�onal  democra�c revolu�on and the world proletarian  struggle.  In 2023, Ka Joma Lives! Study Movement organized  three major webinars, namely: “The Specific  Characteris�cs of Our People’s War”, “Our Urgent  Tasks”, and “Rec�fy Our Errors, Rebuild the Party!”.  These events featured his seminal theore�cal  wri�ngs that outline the fundamental principles of  waging people’s war, carrying out revolu�onary  tasks, and revitalizing the party.  Next to these webinars, Ka Joma Lives! also  launched ten of his books under the Sison Reader  Series last year. These books, a compila�on of his  wri�ngs on movements, various sectors, imperialism in domes�c and interna�onal se�ngs,  interna�onalism, and rights, jus�ce and peace, are  published as Book 12: On the Legal Democra�c  Mass Movement; Book 13: On the Revolu�onary  Movement and Mass Work; Book 14: On the  Workers’ Movement; Book 15: On the Peasant  Movement and Agrarian Revolu�on; Book 16: On  the Youth Movement; Book 17: Women in  Revolu�on and Na�onal Minori�es and the Right to  Self-Determina�on; Book 18: Imperialism in the  Philippines; Book 19: Imperialism in Various Global  Regions; Book 20: Proletarian Interna�onalism and  Interna�onal Solidarity; and Book 21: People’s  Rights, Jus�ce and Peace. Recently, on March 9, Ka Joma Lives! organized a  back-to-back launch of Ka Joma’s books, also under  the Sison Reader Series. En�tled, Book 22: On  Neoliberal Globaliza�on, and Book 23: Intensifying  Interimperialist Contradic�ons, these books contain  a collec�on of Ka Joma’s wri�ngs on neoliberalism  and globaliza�on, and on the possibility of having an  interimperialist war, respec�vely.  Aside from these ac�vi�es, Ka Joma Lives! leads the  commemora�on of Ka Joma’s birth and death  anniversaries. By Ricardo Lozano and Raya Andres-Montañosa<br><br>22First death anniversary On December 16 last year, on Ka Joma’s first death  anniversary, Ka Joma Lives! hosted the gathering of  comrades, allies, and friends of the revolu�onary  movement in the Philippines at the NDFP  Interna�onal Office in Utrecht, the Netherlands to  celebrate his colourful and meaningful life. Through  various tributes, songs, poetry readings, and cultural  performances, he was honoured and remembered  along with several other martyred comrades.  This event also launched Ka Joma Lives!’ Poem  Project. Inspired by Ka Joma’s poem, “Stages of My  Life,” where he chronicled his poli�cal trajectory  using the season metaphor, the project invites  individuals to add a new stanza to the poem or  create their version and interpreta�on as a way of  con�nuing Ka Joma’s legacy.    Likewise, in the Philippines, an event en�tled  “Reflec�ons on Pales�ne, the Philippines, and the  Struggle for a Just and Las�ng Peace,” was  organized. Hundreds of individuals, including  veteran and young ac�vists, discussed and reflected  on Ka Joma’s life and wri�ngs. They shared their  thoughts and personal anecdotes on his works, such  as, “Our Urgent Tasks,” “On Revolu�onary  Violence,” and “The Filipino People’s Democra�c  Revolu�on is Invincible,” as well as on his thema�c  wri�ngs, such as on Israel’s aggressions and  massacre of the Pales�nian people, and peace talks  between the NDFP and the GRP.  In the countryside, on the same day, CPP and NPA  units also conducted various ac�vi�es to honor Ka  Joma, including the renewal of pledges to the Party.  Various guerilla fronts across the country reaffirmed  their wholehearted service to the Filipino people  and their commitment to offer their lives for the  victory of the people’s democra�c revolu�on. Ka Joma’s birthday This year, on February 8, Ka Joma Lives! celebrated  Ka Joma’s 85th birthday by organizing a webinar on  Ka Joma’s work, “Stand for Socialism Against  Modern Revisionism, and a cultural event in  Utrecht, highligh�ng Ka Joma’s valuable teachings  on the importance of being steadfast in holding an  an�-revisionist line and being diligent in studying  MLM. The cultural celebra�on also highlighted the  CPP’s call for rec�fica�on and resurgence, which is  an ideological call to (re)study the basic Party and  MLM documents to imbibe the proletarian  revolu�onary a�tude and style of work fully and  firmly, as well as to ac�vely combat liberalism,  conserva�sm and dogma�sm among other  ideological corrosives that destroy the Party and the  revolu�on. His birthday was also celebrated by the  revolu�onary movement in the Philippines. In a  statement, the CPP paid tribute to the con�nuing  relevance of Ka “Joma” and the validity of the  struggle for na�onal democracy. Members of  Kabataang Makabayan, a clandes�ne revolu�onary  youth organiza�on, in Rizal province, conducted an  ‘OP-OD” or opera�on paint – opera�on paste  ac�vity where they painted a large portrait of Ka  Joma near a public market and the revolu�onary  slogans, “Viva CPP-NPA-NDF!” and “Join the New  People’s Army!” on several public walls. Meanwhile,  also in a statement, the NDF in Southern Tagalog,  brimming with revolu�onary commitment and  op�mism, pledged to con�nue “forward the  rec�fica�on movement and advance the people’s  democra�c revolu�on un�l victory.”<br><br> 23Despite repeated promises of the Marcos Jr. regime  to “end the armed conflict” in the Philippines, the  New People’s Army (NPA) con�nues to advance the  people’s war by launching consecu�ve tac�cal  offensives, ambush opera�ons and puni�ve ac�ons  against elements of the fascist Armed Forces of the  Philippines (AFP) and their agents in Rizal, Masbate,  and Negros in the first few months of 2024. On January 31, a unit of NPA-Rizal Narciso Antazo  Aramil Command successfully launched an ambush  opera�on against soldiers of the 80th Infantry  Ba�alion (IB) opera�ng in Lukutang Malaki,  Barangay San Isidro, Rodriguez, Rizal. Three were  confirmed dead among the ranks of the fascist  troops. The NPA unit retreated safely and was  unharmed. According to reports, the 80th IB’s intense and  relentless focused military opera�ons in Rodriguez  have been going on for nearly a year. Apart from  serving as guards of the Wawa-Tayabasan Dam  being built, troops of the 80th IB also protects the  interests of the ruling big landlords such as the  Aranetas, Villars and Robles, in Lukutang Malaki.  The rampant militariza�on brought fear to locals in  the area due to mul�ple cases of harassment,  surveillance, food blockades, popula�on control,  and other human rights viola�ons perpetrated by  the 80th IB. On January 13, a unit of the NPA-Masbate Jose  Rapsing Command hit the 96th IB troopers opera�ng in Si�o Lantawan, Barangay Gangao,  Baleno, Masbate. The said military unit immediately  hid their casual�es to cover up their losses.  According to Ka Luz del Mar, NPA-Masbate  spokesperson, the armed offensive is part of their  efforts to seek jus�ce for the vic�ms of military  abuses in the area and defend the people against  ongoing military opera�ons in the province. Among  those referred to by Ka Luz include the 24 vic�ms  of poli�cal killings in Masbate under the US-Marcos  Jr. regime. Residents are also indignant at the  persistent encampment of “counterinsurgency”  units of the AFP and the Philippine Na�onal Police  (PNP) in schools in the province – an outright  viola�on of interna�onal rules of war. According to  reports, pros�tu�on also became rampant in the  areas where military camps were being built.  Meanwhile, NPA-Northern Negros Roselyn Jean  Pelle Command launched consecu�ve puni�ve  ac�ons against perpetrators of the Sagay 9  Massacre and other enemies of the people in  separate opera�ons last January 2 and February 13.  A .22 rifle and 44 rounds of ammuni�on, a .357  pistol plus bullets, two smartphones and various IDs  were recovered by guerilla fighters a�er the ac�on.  On January 9, 2024, the NPA-Negros Oriental  Leondardo Panaligan Command similarly mounted  a puni�ve ac�on against a notorious intelligence  asset of the local police in Sityo Mainit, Barangay  Bulado, Guihulngan City, Negros Oriental. NPA units welcome the year with  series of tactical offensives, ambush  operations against AFP in Rizal,  Masbate and Negros By Hugo Francisco<br><br>24www.ndfp.info The guerilla is like a poet Keen to the rustle of leaves The break of twigs The ripples of the river The smell of fire And the ashes of departure. The guerilla is like a poet. He has merged with the trees The bushes and the rocks Ambiguous but precise Well-versed on the law of mo�on And the master of myriad of images. The guerilla is like a poet Enrhymed with nature The subtle rhythm of the greenery The outer silence, the outer innocence The steel tensile in-grace That ensnares the enemy.The guerilla is like a poet. He moves with the green brown mul�tude In bush burning with red flowers That crown and hearten all Swarming the terrain as a flood Marching at last again st the stronghold. An endless movement of strength Behold the protracted theme: The people's epic, the people's war.by Jose Maria SisonThe Guerilla Is Like a Poet</p></div>
