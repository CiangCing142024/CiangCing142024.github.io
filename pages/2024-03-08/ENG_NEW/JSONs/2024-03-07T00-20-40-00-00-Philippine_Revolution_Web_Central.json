Under the Duterte regime, it was given a mining and Geosciences Bureau license to be 25 years. The AGCI Permit is given among the wide and obstacle to local officials, attitudes and residents. It has not been released to the devastating and unable to restrict injury to the ecosystem's offshore mining not only in operation strap, but even in the wider ocean.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It will destroy 50 acres of Seagrass (reefs) and the forests of protected islands and oceans, such as Palaui Island Protected Landscape and Seascape and Babuyan Marine Corridor. These places are home to the bloody, whales and many other wildlife will disappear.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The company has been stressed that the nature of their operations is not damaged, even if it is impossible in accordance with research and study. Distortion to the ocean and all the mariners of the seabed (drilling) in the seabed to sustain the magnetite sand under.
