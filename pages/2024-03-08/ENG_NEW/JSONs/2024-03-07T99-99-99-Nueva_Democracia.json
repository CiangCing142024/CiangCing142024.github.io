They demand decreased bureaucratic procedures and changes in common agricultural policy (PAC), fair prices for their products, aid against drought and suspension of imports from some products from other countries, since they point out that competition is unfair, already that these foreign products are not required the same as European products. One of the most important actions of protesters was the blockade of the Mercadona Logistics Center in the city of Antequera, where farmers demanded fair prices for their products. Mercadona is one of the main supermarket chains in Spain, an action that was repressed by the riots, who threw tear gas and rubber bullets.\n </p>\n <figure class=\"wp-block-embed alignright is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\">\n  <div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"550\">\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">\n     The Spanish police use tear gas against farmers to end the blockade of the Mercadona logistics platform (large distribution) this evening in Antequera.\n     <a href=\"https://t.co/VMYyMPHwKR\">\n      pic.twitter.com/VMYyMPHwKR\n     </a>\n    </p>\n    \u2014 BOOM!US (@HeadlineRoundup)\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HeadlineRoundup/status/1755513370781110563?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">\n     February 8, 2024\n    </a>\n   </blockquote>\n   <script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\">\n   </script>\n  </div>\n </figure>\n <div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n  <figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\">\n   <p class=\"IMAGE_ARCHIVED\">\n    &lt;The image of this location is in the list above, but in order to protect the site's traffic costs, it cannot be displayed here, sorry.&gt;\n   </p>\n   <figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">\n    <em>\n     <mark class=\"has-inline-color has-black-color\" style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\">\n      Hundreds of farmers protest in Spain.

Blocks and protests have been recorded in several cities and roads in Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, France, Spain, Romania, Poland, Italy, Greece, Portugal, among others. Some of them with clashes between protesters and the repressive forces of the State.\n </p>\n <p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-b5da8cb498489b9ac6b8b207b3b64440\">\n  Next, some of the causes or reasons that have led the farmers to take the de facto roads and take to the streets to block and protest.\n </p>\n <p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-e8be91f2cca71c6e72893dbc00aedf4b\">\n  1- The increase in production costs due to the increase in several necessary supplies in agricultural production. For example, fuel prices due to Russia's invasion war against Ukraine, to which the fact that some governments such as Germany and France are added to eliminate taxes, or tax exemptions, which farmers receive Agricultural diesel, which aggravates the problem. Also fertilizers and electricity have substantially increased their prices.\n </p>\n <p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-69dc792288247bd0ce0d0d1b4b04ded8\">\n  2- Imposition of environmental measures to farmers. The European Parliament, through the European Green Pact, and reforms to the Common Agrarian Policy (PAC), seeks to impose environmental measures, taxes and restrictions on agricultural production. Some of the measures that have been mentioned most are forcing farmers to dedicate 4% of their land to non -productive activities, reduce the use of fertilizers by 20% and make crop rotation. Measures with which, according to protesters, production costs are increased. In addition, farmers denounce that, while they are imposed greater environmental measures and controls, imported products, from other countries, are not required, therefore, competition is totally unequal.\n </p>\n <p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-2df44001bd229cc59a7a6f8f6fb7af27\">\n  3- Due to the War of Invasion in Ukraine, the European Union lifted the restrictions on imports from that country. In particular, cereal entry has in serious problems to European farmers, since Ukraine is one of the main grain -producing countries in the world, and the entrance without tariffs of their products, to other European countries, causes a fall of the prices and impossibility for local farmers to compete, working at a loss.\n </p>\n <p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-2af27eec96c2767d1e3a8ae44c21423b\">\n  4- The role of intermediaries. While the peasants are receiving low prices for their products, many of these products have increased their prices in supermarkets, where they are acquired by the final consumer, however, that price increase is being left by intermediaries, which are mainly the Financial capital and large distribution chains and supermarkets, in the hands of large monopolies.\n </p>\n <p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-53099b60b7f065feab555d72a3799a33\">\n  There are more fighting reasons, but these are some of the most mentioned in different media that have covered the protests.\n </p>\n <p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-ea1be0a735db59be7477edb0ad1036cd\">\n  The European people have shown great expressions of struggle in recent years, just remember the struggle of the French yellow vests that shuddered the entire country, and that aroused solidarity in many peoples of the world. Today are the peasants throughout Europe who fight for their rights. Against the worsening of their living conditions due to production, against unequal competition generated by imports of foreign products, against the low prices paid by intermediaries for their products, for greater guarantees from the State to protect the local peasant production, among other fighting flags. Meanwhile, the governments of each country have responded in two ways: with promises to mitigate the struggle and with repression when the masses have expressed their combativeness and firmness in the blockages and in the confrontations with the forces of police repression. However, although governments carry out promises, European states and the European Union, they cannot solve the underlying problem: the crisis of imperialism that, in their insatiable search to increase their profits and save their decadent system, is carrying out their plans and reforms to increase exploitation over the people, to download the weight of the crisis over the working classes of the countryside and the city, and to eliminate subsidies or rights acquired by the masses in the struggles of past decades, to which, the people European has responded, and will continue to do so, with combative struggle and organization.\n </p>\n <p>\n </p>\n</article>\n", "source": "https://nuevademocracia.com.co/?p=26017", "title": "European peasants have been protests for more than two months", "author": "Nueva Democracia", "categories": ["_", "INTERNACIONAL"]}
