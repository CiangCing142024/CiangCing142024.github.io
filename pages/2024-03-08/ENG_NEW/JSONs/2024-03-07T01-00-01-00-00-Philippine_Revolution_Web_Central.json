It began in the middle of the past year, and is expected to last until May or June this year. It is expected that up to 65 provinces will suffer from drought and cause extensive damage to the country's livelihood.\n </p>\n <p>\n  By the end of February, it was reported to have reached \u20b1 941.7 million worth of damaged crops due to damage to nearly 15,000 hectares of agricultural land. In studies, it is estimated that up to 250,000 hectares of agricultural land will be damaged. Hundreds of thousands of farmers are at risk of getting deeper into debt to commercial-USERUCTIONS, getting worse and hungry and hungry.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The drought that drought brought the drought to the farmer without their own land, there was not enough funds, rain and irrigation. Hundreds of thousands of farm workers will lose their jobs or income. As a result of drought, fires in the mountains, which endanger the life and livelihood of the minority masses.\n </p>\n <p>\n  El Ni\u00f1o's drought effects are worsening due to the destruction of nature, especially the loss of forest due to long periods of logging, mining and construction of dams and other infrastructure that destroy watershed and water sources. The large foreign companies and the comprador bourgeoisie are the main offenders of them. Despite the intense damage caused by them, the Marcos regime continues to favors the aggressive entry of this destructive company into the countryside.\n </p>\n <p>\n  El Ni\u00f1o has been expected to have been in the Philippines for more than a year this year, but the Marcos regime has no concrete plans to support farmers who can afford the livelihood. Although the drought would have been a long time, the agencies did not give the reactionary government a scientific advice, financial or alternative plants, and allowed the peasant masses to be destroyed and contaminated in the crops.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Worse, Marcos is now using El Ni\u00f1o to provide huge funds to earn money on infrastructure projects such as \"solar-powered\" irrigation that, if only, it is finally set up and nothing more At the height of drought and water drainage in many places. Lastly, cloud seeding plans, distribution of tractors, and small insurance or insurance in the damaged crops, have no media and insurance.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Despite the expectation of the fall of drought, especially the rice regime, the US-Marcos regime does nothing to ensure the supply of food, but to open the country's door for rice imports, as well as the onions, garlic, and other agricultural products. The price of rice has increased this February and is expected to continue to increase.\n </p>\n <p>\n  To deal with the intense impact of the drought because of El Ni\u00f1o, the Party and the revolutionary forces must strive to unite and migrate to the peasant masses in order to defend their well-being, livelihood and economic and social rights. The peasant organizations must be multiplied and strengthened to exert their strength to fight for immediate steps that will be unlucky during El Ni\u00f1o.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The farmer's masses should be widely mobilized to assert the necessary initiatives for urgent relief to them, including distributing the required funding or support support, postponement or cancellation of debt repayment, non-payment of land rent, and carrying out the Immediate solutions to solve the water problem. They must act together to fight the mines and other planting plantations.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They must also be exposed to revitalize the spirit of the peasant masses especially in the face of the drought. Through their organizations, widespread mobilization can be planned to cooperate the adjustment of the irrigation system in their respective areas, and sharing (rather than scramble) in flowing water in their fields.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The US-Marcos regime should collectively charge the US-Marcos regime for its excessive neglect, corruption and burdens of steps that exacerbate their condition. It all burns the anger of the peasant masses and drives them along the path of protest and resistance.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In the midst of the drought, the units of the New People's Army were assigned by the party to actively act to help the peasant masses keep up with the face of the fertilizer. In addition to sustaining their organizations, NPA units directly assist in production, digging wells, irrigation, and other initiatives in favor of the well-being of the peasant masses.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The peasant masses are increasingly angry that in the midst of intense drought, all thousands of AFP fascist troops are relentlessly launching extensive repression operations and armed offensives to occupy people's resistance. In the midst of their misery, hundreds of millions of pesos are being destroyed by the AFP in the middle of the jet fighter and helicopters to drop a bomb and explode cannon in the fields and mountains.\n </p>\n <p>\n  AFP battalions are now launching offensive nationwide, in accordance with the US-Marcos regime's order to defeat all guerrilla fields until the end of March. It does not bring anything to the peasant masses but more suffering.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The neglect, corruption and torture policies, and fascist terrorism of the US-Marcos regime have all served as a flaw in the dry straw of the town's anger in the vast countryside. The situation exists for widespread protests of masses in the countryside, and further strengthening the NPA armed resistance.\n </p>\n</div>\n", "source": "https://philippinerevolution.nu/2024/03/07/labanan-ang-pabaya-at-korap-na-rehimeng-us-marcos-sa-gitna-ng-el-nino/", "type": "article", "title": "PRWC \u00bbFight the negligent and corrupt US-Marcos regime in the middle of El Ni\u00f1o", "description": "El Ni\u00f1o's drought in much of the country is now in much of the country.
