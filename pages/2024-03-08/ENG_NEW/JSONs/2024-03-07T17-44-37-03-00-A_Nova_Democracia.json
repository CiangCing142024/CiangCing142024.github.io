The situation has revolted the workers, who protested on January 18 against the violation of rights, and mobilized all the people in the region, concerned with the possible closure of the unit.

He informs that the doctors were the first affected and that they would have been six months without a single penny, and that in recent times this has expanded to all staff of the hospital. There is no forecast for payment. In addition, there are also widespread complaints about the lack of inputs and medicines.\n </p>\n <figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\">\n  <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">\n   <img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-170500\" data-id=\"170500\" data-lazy-sizes=\"(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px\" data-lazy-src=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ENTREVISTA_1.jpeg\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ENTREVISTA_1.jpeg 642w, https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ENTREVISTA_1-282x300.jpeg 282w, https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ENTREVISTA_1-60x64.jpeg 60w\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"682\" src=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ENTREVISTA_1.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ENTREVISTA_1.jpeg\" width=\"642\"/>\n   <figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">\n    Hospital employee denounces late payments.

Exemplated that, on many occasions, several nurses had to take over 3 to 4 patients in the ICU. This is just another proof that it is unsustainable for these employees to work without being sure when they will receive their proper payments. This same employee made a point of emphasizing that he is since last month without paying his bills, due to the high interest rates charged for the delay of payment, which is the reality of most of the Sarandi Metropolitan Hospital.\n </p>\n <div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n  <figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\">\n   <img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-170504\" data-lazy-sizes=\"(max-width: 472px) 100vw, 472px\" data-lazy-src=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Instagram-09-472x1024.jpeg\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Instagram-09-472x1024.jpeg 472w, https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Instagram-09-138x300.jpeg 138w, https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Instagram-09-708x1536.jpeg 708w, https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Instagram-09-60x130.jpeg 60w, https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Instagram-09.jpeg 738w\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Instagram-09-472x1024.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Instagram-09-472x1024.jpeg\" width=\"472\"/>\n  </figure>\n </div>\n <p>\n  According to APP-Syndicate, most of the 700 employees are late.
