Unsurprisingly, the martyrdom of the Five of the Five of the Selfishness who served their interests in their interests was a major loss to the masses in Bohol and the Filipino people. However, their lives and sacrifices serve as an inspiration for the ongoing struggle of the revolutionary struggle in the province.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ever since the seeds of the revolutionary movement in Bohol in the 1980s were imposed, it has never been overcome by the reactionary state. Despite the repeated \"insurgency-free\" declaration, the Fire Revolution in Bohol has never been extinguished. Because oppression and exploitation remain, the revolutionary resistance to the island was not overwhelmed.\n </p>\n <h2>\n  Bol-anon masses\n </h2>\n <p>\n  The majority of 1.39 million people of the island suffer, especially the peasant masses. Rice and corn are the main products here, as well as coconut, bananas, cassava, saba and oil palm.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Of the total 482,100 hectares of land in the province, 273,950 are agricultural, and 101,271 are a forest. It is called the \"food granary\" of Central Visayas due to large food production. According to 2018 data, 26% or 70,117 hectares of agricultural land are rice fields. Of these, only 56% have enough irrigation.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Farmers are now fearing the damage that El Ni\u00f1o will bring to the rice fields. One of these farmers was Dad Boying, who was very worried about his garden because of a \"dry spell\" (low in normal rainfall) in Bohol.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Irrigation is difficult because we only depend on the rain ... elsewhere irrigation, but only a few benefit, sports,\" he said.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This is very contrary to the Bohol local government's boast of November 2023 which provided \u20b1 7.1 million to add to farmers and to be affected by drought. With the exception of the poor, there are many more requirements for the benefit.\n </p>\n <p>\n  El Nino will bring more losses to Bohol farmers. Daddy Boying complains that in the regular garden he is no longer earning, he will be overwhelmed by the lack of irrigation.\n </p>\n <p>\n  At least \u20b1 11,000 he costs each plant cycle. He reaches 456 kilos or 12 sacks of rice, and will deduct 2 sacks in return to the landlord. If for sale, he will only earn \u20b1 9,120 at the price of \u20b1 24 per kilogram of rice. Because the rice prices in the market are so expensive, and the price is so expensive, Father Boying is no longer selling the harvest.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The greater catastrophe of the masses is the increasing and widespread land seizure of private corporations and landlords in the local government. These include the seizure of the Bohol Cattle Corporation (BCC), owned by the Marcos, on the 622 hectares of land fought by the Trinidad-Talibon Integrated Farmers Association (TTIFA). The BCC ignores the documents held by the farmers in its land seizure campaign that is part of the total 1,973 land it claims.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Farmers are also tortured by the existing plantation of the Oil Palm of the Philippine Agricultural Land and Mills Development Inc (PALM INC), owned by the Agumil Philippines company, which is a part of Filipino and Malaysian investors. In 2012, at least 2,500 farmers of oil palm were bankrupt because of the Palm Inc scheme that had a very high interest in the loan and a very low cost of its fruits. It only bought the farmers for \u20b1 2/kilogram. Currently, farmers are unable to benefit from the land that was planted with oil palm because of the chemical used here. Palm INC covers 6,000 hectares of land for the plantation.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Fishermen are also drowning in poverty with 33% of the total population. They are lost due to the ever -increasing prices of crude oil, equipment and other expenses. They also fear that they will lose their livelihood due to the 650-hectare plan of the Panglao Island, and a reclamation in Tagbilaran City.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Far from the gastric of the masses Bol-anon is boasting the local government of 7.1% growth in the Gross Domestic Product of the Province in 2023 that came primarily from tourism. Despite the money that reaches up to one million tourists annually, the sweat masses in Bohol remain poor and hungry.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Meanwhile, if the masses are not hungry, the military and police have killed and tortured them. In recent years, repression of the Bol-anon masses has been constantly opposed to their land rights. There are currently 10 political prisoners in Bohol including 75-year-old Adolfo Salas SR, a founder of the founder of the Philippine Peasant Movement of the Philippines Movement to Hapong to Older (Claim-KMP). The 47th IB and the so -called Task Group Bohol of the Armed Forces of the Philppines and the Philippine National Police are main agents of state terrorism.\n </p>\n</div>\n", "source": "https://philippinerevolution.nu/2024/03/07/mataba-ang-lupa-sa-pagsusulong-ng-rebolusyon-sa-bohol/", "type": "article", "title": "PRWC \u00bbThe soil is fat in promoting the revolution in Bohol", "description": "The US-Marcos regime is mistaken in the alleged masses' armed revolutionary resistance to the masses of the massacre of the massacre of the arrested five red fighters of the New People's Army (NPA) and party cadres in Barangay Campagao, Bilar, Bohol on February 23.
