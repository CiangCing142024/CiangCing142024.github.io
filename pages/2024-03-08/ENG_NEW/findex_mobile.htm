<p>
  At the same time as the foreign mining operation (seashore) on the shores of Cagayan in 2021, it was a great harm to the livelihood of fishermen in Cagayan Valley.
 </p>
<p>
  Cagayan's first and largest and largest, the offshore mining involved 56,013 hectares in the coast and oceans in the 10 regions of the region (Sanchez Mira, Claveria, Gonzita, Gonzaga and Sta. . Ana). It rings a sandpaper of Magnetite mineral, which is 100% china's extension. The Magnetite is a key ingredient.
 </p>
<p>
  Gunt in the Chinese Apollo Global Capital Inc. (Agci) operation. Under the Duterte regime, it was given a mining and Geosciences Bureau license to be 25 years. The AGCI Permit is given among the wide and obstacle to local officials, attitudes and residents. It has not been released to the devastating and unable to restrict injury to the ecosystem's offshore mining not only in operation strap, but even in the wider ocean.
 </p>
<p>
  It will destroy 50 acres of Seagrass (reefs) and the forests of protected islands and oceans, such as Palaui Island Protected Landscape and Seascape and Babuyan Marine Corridor. These places are home to the bloody, whales and many other wildlife will disappear.
 </p>
<p>
  The company has been stressed that the nature of their operations is not damaged, even if it is impossible in accordance with research and study. Distortion to the ocean and all the mariners of the seabed (drilling) in the seabed to sustain the magnetite sand under. It is also a great dispute to pass back to the rocks and sands after the mineral. It is also dangerous to the ships its in Gonzaga spelling communities. In 2023, drowning barks were cut off because of the winding egay air. One of the supports of this tugboat is moved to the coast.
 </p>
<p>
  When the operation began, the Gonzaga fishermen have been banned from the member of the Mina. Due to the left effects of the previous Black Sand Mining operations held at the coast of town, they were forced to stay away because no one was arrested in the spelling.
 </p>
<p>
  Because of this, the whole food security of the region is affected. The mine is linked to the municipal waters (15 kilometers of the coast from the coast) source 60.2% of the fish supply in Cagayan Valley.
 </p>
<h2>
  Mine at the cover of dredging
 </h2>
<p>
  The Cagayanons plus the Black Sand Mining effect on Riverfront Construction Inc. In Cagayan River performed at the "dredging" under the Cagayan River Restoration Program.
 </p>
<p>
  In the city of Aparri, the livelihood of 11,000 fishermen was released for uninterrupted operations of dredging and large ships carrying stone and sand toward China. They say, activities of these ships create a noble and severe light, and passing chemicals that cause the ecosystem that causes the number of fish and arrogance (small brides) that lead their livelihoods. The company waves in places where they are fishing, away from scheduled for dredging.
 </p>
<p>
  The income of the fishermen since the project "dredging." From 200 containers arrested in five days sailing, lucky to fill fishermen with 50 containers. As, the former 200 kilos fish was arrested by a boat at a night fishing has only been three kilograms. In 2021, their income has taken up to ₱ 300 to ₱ 1,000 for three days of fishing, far from the former we ₱ 3,000 to ₱ 7,000.
 </p>
<p>
  The livelihoods are affected. The project began, the income came to ₱ 8,000 and sellers and other fish. From 2021, only ₱ 700 are only 700 in 5-day wagons.

  Large and foreign capitalists deliberately intensify union workers and negotiations to remain cheap and subtle force in the Philippines. It is contrary to the reactionary state officials, in the own law and international agreements that are signed by it. It is difficult to build the union and push to recognize it as an exclusive representative of negotiating workers.
 </p>
<p>
  It is their experience of Bokya and Bayong, both 39 years and contractuals even 13-14 years of employment in a Cebu factory.
 </p>
<p>
  Those reasons have convinced them to take part in the union. "I'm hurting that there is a constructive union for job security so that it is not just to be stuck," Bokya said. "At that time, rumors were so strong that our (Labor) agency was only. This is the issue of first, "says Bayong also.
 </p>
<p>
  Year 2018 The union has been established in their factory, but today it is not recognized by the capitalist as the Sole and Exclusive Bargaining Agent (SEBA) or the sole representative of negotiating workers. To prevent the construction of the union, the maneydsment placed members of the "floating status" or removal of regular work rotations. The capitalist is a four-rounded stage to embrace those organized.
 </p>
<p>
  The workers resisted. They launched joint protests and pushed to open the inspection factory in the Department of Labor and Employment to prove the capitalist's labor-only contracting (LOC). They also rejected regular rotation to the workers put on floating status.
 </p>
<p>
  "We armband protest, sent a letter to talk but no response," Bokya said.
 </p>
<p>
  Hinunua, capitalist and state intensified the labor of workers. It entered NTF-ELCAC to the factory to conduct a forum where the union is redented. The union leaders threaten and intimidate their families. MANEYDSMENT MANAGES SHOW THE PASSIST AGENCY agents.
 </p>
<p>
  The workforce is the result of NTF-ELCAC requirements in the factory. "To gather the challenge, we have been home actively with the union of myembal workers, gathered them and trying to return the vitality of (words) and study."
 </p>
<p>
  They maintained the resistance to recognize the union as sheba and pushed the hatred for workers as much as a bribe. They are farming farm agency petitions to identify contractuals as regular. Outside of the factory, they have abandoned workers who lost regular income and times of stress.
 </p>
<p>
  "There is a matter of work at a time of widespread placing on" floating status, "and on hurricane Odette," Bokya.
 </p>
<p>
  "In that pandemic, it also helps to promote help to provide aid in government agencies," Bayong said.
 </p>
<p>
  In the process of building a union, they have woke up and widows in a wider social issue, especially in widespread violations of the state of human rights. "We have accompanied protests about government killings and harassment, in rallies against treading our rights," Bokya added. He also joined relief drives for the affected or understood communities of workers.
 </p>
<p>
  In personal life, they gain discipline, courage and militancy. "My life has changed because I have learned much of what the true union is, how true will resist and do not tell the capitalist," Bokya said. "I know the principles better, and no longer fears maneydsmen," says Bayong.
 </p>
<p>
  "Limiting drink," Bokya. "It is no longer shy to talk and be involved in making others understand our rights."

<p>
  In the hearing of Congress on February 29, it was intimidated in the Confederation of Wearable Exporters of the Philippines (Conwep) the intercourse of the clothing industry if given even crumbs to workers here. In its report in the Marcos regime, it warns to lose the same 120,000 or 70% -80% of these 160,000 workers if the Senate and Congress approved the unless increase. They are added to 21,912 workers set to remove this year due to "more slow international demand."
 </p>
<p>
  Conwep is an association of large capitalists who specializes in manufacturing clothes for the largest "global brand" (fabric brands worldwide). Ralph Lauren, Coach, Michael Kors, Adidas, Dillard's, Marks &amp; amp; Spencer and Ann Taylor. It exports the forms of clothes before the US, the countries of the European Union, the United Kingdom and Japan are next. The association dominates foreign companies, where the least has 1,000 laborers. Two of the largest companies here run 6-7 factories and employ 22,000-24,000 workers. Such companies have operations as well as other parts of Asia (Cambodia, Thailand and Vietnam). Before the pandemic, it employs to 220,000 workers.
 </p>
<p>
  Majority of women's laborers, relatively young, and contractual. Overall, less than 17% -25% were hired by the men.
 </p>
<h2>
  Smallest industries, leverage exploits
 </h2>
<p>
  From the 1990s, the industry has become compassionate in the Philippines' clothing industry in the international trade in clothes. In 2020, there were 200 factories that manufacturing country clothes, 240 traders and more than 1,000 subcontractors. It employs more than 490,000 workers in different capacity, and majority or 69.4% of these women.
 </p>
<p>
  In 2020, the Costeemical Covid-19 is used to implement the expansive removal, diversity of wages and additional flexibility. It placed in the "floating status" thousand workers while it was directly united. The factory remains worse under the Taiwanese sports city international company, the largest employer in the Mactan Export Processing Zone. In 2020-2023, less than 12,000 workers lost work when it moved operations to its factories in Vietnam. Released to the Conwep "save jobs" the deletions. Actually, retrenchments were made to keep the degree of profitability to the workmanship of Philippine workers.
 </p>
<p>
  Like the other company within the entrance, the foreign capitalist in the Conwep is enjoyed with no corresponding privileges and incentives. Includes tax holidays, "duty-free" or taxable entry of necessary material, use of advanced infrastructures built using public funds, "flexible" labor, and subsidies and rent. They also take advantage of the extra taxation of taxation under the Create law. Invalid but actual, it is implemented within the "no union, no strike."
 </p>
<p>
  Foreign capitalists are allowed to bring their entire income in the Philippines. As it happened, its factories were arrested in the Philippines with no workers.
 </p>
<p>
  In 2023, the Conwep recorded more than $ 1 billion worth of export. For 2024, the Foreign Buyers Association of the Philippines is estimated that it is likely to improve 2% or to $ 1.33 billion due to entering new orders.

<p>
  The US-Marcos regime has been mistaken for believing in the armed revolutionary resistance to the volatile masses when the five red fighter (NPA, Bohol, Bohol, Bohol were covered by the NPA. On February 23. Bohol and Filipino people are undeniable for the Filipino peasantity of five without skepticism serving their interests. As, their lives and sacrifices serve as inspiration to the continued endurance of the revolutionary struggle in the province.
 </p>
<p>
  Ever since the seeds of the revolutionary movement of Bohol in the 1980s, it has not been completely overthrown in the reactionary state. Insurgency-free "Insurgency-free" declaration, the fire of Bohol's revolution is none of the fire. Due to retaining oppression and exploitation, the revolutionary resistance of the island has not overcome.
 </p>
<h2>
  Condition of the mood
 </h2>
<p>
  The majority is struggling with 1.39 million people on the island, especially the peasant masses. The main product here is rice and corn, as the coconut, banana, village, Saba and Oil Palm.
 </p>
<p>
  In total 482,100 hectares of Province, 273,950 agricultural, and 101,271 the forest. It is called "Food Granarian" (food barn) in Central Visayas for great production of food. In the data in 2018, 26% or 70,117 hectares of agricultural houses. Here, only 56% have enough irrigation.
 </p>
<p>
  Farmers are now worried about the damage that El Niño has in the hills. One here the farmer Dad Boying, who was very worried about his farm because of the hitting "dry spell" (under normal rain level) in Bohol.
 </p>
<p>
  "Irrigation is difficult because we just depend on the rain ... elsewhere is irrigation, but only a few benefits, favors," he said.
 </p>
<p>
  It is very contrary to the local government in Bohol on November 2023 that spends ₱ 7.1 million aid for farmers and affected by drought. There is even a little more, many other requirements are asked to benefit.
 </p>
<p>
  The more severe losses are the fruit of El Nino to Bohol farmers. Daddy boyfriend complained, in a regular steam, he didn't even have it, he was more than a lack of irrigation.
 </p>
<p>
  It is not less than ₱ 11,000. His total cost of each cycle of the tyrant. He was reaped here with 456 pounds or 12 sheeps, and 2 sacks as a payment to landlords. When selling, he only earns ₱ 9,120 at the price of ₱ 24 per kilogram of rice. Because it's too low, and the cost of rice prices in the market, Daddy Boying has never sold his harvest.
 </p>
<p>
  More than a greater danger to the bolly and spreading plague of the land in private corporations and landlords Local government. In addition to the Bohol Cattle Corporation (BCC), Kroni is owned by the Marcos, at 622 acres of the Trinity-Talibon Integrated Farmers Association (TTIFA). BCC ignored the documents held by farmers in this segregation campaign as part of the total 1,973 absorption.
 </p>
<p>
  Farmers will also suffer the oil palm plantation in the Philippine Agricultural Land and Mills Development Inc. (Palm Inc.), owned in the Company Philippines, which is socially in Philippine businesses and Malaysian. In 2012, less than 2,500 farmers planted Oil Palm were bankrupt because of the Palm Inc.'s highest interest rate and lower buying its fruits. The farmers have only purchased the fruit ₱ 2 / kilogram. Meanwhile, farmers are not useful to the former oil palm due to chemical used here. Palm Inc. is located on 6,000 hectares for plantation.
 </p>
<p>
  Fishermen also invades prubinals of 33% of the total population. They are involved in continuing crude prices, tools and other expenses. They also worry about livelihood due to the 650-hectare of the island of the island of the island, and a companionship of Tagbilaran City.
 </p>
<p>
  The local government is far from the local government of 7.1% growth in the Gross Domestic Product in the Province in 2023 that originated in tourism. Amid the money entered by the total millions of tourists each year, the masses of Bohol remained a poster.
 </p>
<p>
  Meanwhile, if not to starve the Bollye masses, they are killed and tortured by the military and police. At the past few years, contradicting the oppression of the multitude resisted for their right to land. Current 10 Political prisoners in Bohol including 75-year-old Adolfo Salas SR, one of the established villages in the Philippine peasant movement . The 47th IB is a leading terrorism agent of the 47th IB and the so-called Task Group Bohol of the Armed Forces of Philppines and Philippine National Police.

<p>
  The majority of the Penomen El Niño has a great part of the country. It began in the middle of the last year, and he was expected to last until May or June this year. It is expected to be up to 65 provinces to experience drought and produce broad damage to mass livelihoods in the countryside.
 </p>
<p>
  In the end of February, it was reported that at ₱ 941.7 million were worth the resources of nearly 15,000 acres of agricultural. In studies, it is estimated for more than 250,000 acres of agricultural lands. Hundreds of thousands of farmers are concerned - are buried in the deeper debt of commercial-usurers, to take care of a harsh and hunger.
 </p>
<p>
  The massacre was worse with the drought of the mass farmer who had no own land, no enough investment, relied on rain and away from irrigation. Hundreds of thousands of farmers have lost their livelihoods or work. Due to the drought, the fire was held in the mountains, which endangered life and livelihood especially in the minority masses.
 </p>
<p>
  El Niño's drought impaired due to the destruction of nature, especially for the forests for trial for long periods of time, mining and building dams and other infrastructures that have destroyed watershed and water sources. Large foreign companies and bourgeoisie-compradors are mainly guilty here. In spite of the severe harm it brings out, the Marcos regime continues to favor the aggressive entry into the rich company in the countryside.
 </p>
<p>
  Over a year when Hitting El Niño in the Philippines has been sufficient, but the Marcos regime has no concrete plan to help those who will affect the livelihood. Although it has long been known to the impact of the drought, the agencies have not immediately provides scientific advice, financial or alternative plants, and the massive masses have been released.
 </p>
<p>
  Worst, Mark now uses El Niño to spend a great fund to catch a source of infrastructure projects such as "solar-powered" irrigation, when it is too late to build and no more of drought and drying the water in a large area. It is also too late, cleansing the media and no significant effects of production and life of the peasant plans, distributing tractors, and small funds for insurance or insurance of the insurance.
 </p>
<p>
  In spite of the expected production of production due to the drought, the US-Marcos regime has no other manufacture to ensure the food supply, but the country is increasing, even onion, Garlic, and other agricultural products. The price of rice increases in February and expected to go up.
 </p>
<p>
  To deal with the severe effects of the drought because of El Niño, the Party and the revolutionary forces have to be consumed and promoted to protect their wages, livelihoods and social rights. Farmers' organizations must be multiplied and intensifying their strength to struggle with the hatred steps to give up during the El Niño.
 </p>
<p>
  The peasant masses have to be released to push the necessary steps for the wake of their relief, including the provision of the needed fund or emergency support, dismissal of debt payments, not paying the debt , and implementing immediate solutions to solve water problem. They must work together to focus on mines and other plantations that destroy nature.
 </p>
<p>
  They should also be hugged to refresh the spirit of the farmer's cooperation especially before the wickedness of the drought. Through their organizations, it will be planned to work together to work together to repair the irrigation system with their respective places, and repayment (rather than) the water in their fields.
 </p>
<p>
  The US-Marcos regime must collectively be collected in its severe neglect, corruption and poverty measures that interfere with their circumstances. All of this fueled the anger of the peasant masses and drove them down the path of protest and resistance.
 </p>
<p>
  Between the drought, the Party ordered the units of the new People's Army to actively act to help the peasant masses that can endure the disaster. In addition to building their accidents, the NPA units directly helps production, digging wells, making irrigation, and other measures in favor of the peasant mass.
 </p>
<p>
  More than the peasant masses between the severe drought, thousands of fascist troops in the AFP continue to launch a broad conceivable operation and armed offensives to hostile people. Between their suffering, hundreds of millions were wasted by the AFP in the wagons and successive flights of jet fighters and helicopters to cast a bomb and fired a cannon of farms and countryside.
 </p>
<p>
  Subsub offensive is now launched in AFP's battalions throughout the country, following the US-Marcos regime's order to defeat all guerrillas until the end of March. This is nothing to give to the peasant masses but severe suffering.
 </p>
<p>
  Admitting, corruption and policies, and fascist terrorism in the US-Marcos regime have also served as a speech of the wide of the people in the wide countryside. The situation sustained in order to join the hectic protests in the massacre of countryside, and more intensity in the NPA armed resistance.

<p>
  From the beginning of foreign offshore mining operations (ocean mining) on the shores of Cagayan in 2021, it has caused a significant damage to the livelihood of fishermen in the Cagayan Valley.
 </p>
<p>
  The first and largest in the country, the offshore mining in Cagayan covers 56,013 hectares of coast and ocean in 10 towns in the region (Sanchez Mira, Claveria, Pamplona, Abulug, Ballesteros, Aparri, Buguey, Sta. Teresita, Gonzaga and Sta. Ana). It haunts sand sources of mineral magnetite, which is a hundred percent exported to China. Magnetite is a key ingredient in making iron.
 </p>
<p>
  Holding the operation of the Chinese company Apollo Global Capital Inc. Under the Duterte regime, the Mining and Geosciences Bureau has been granted a license for 25 years. The Agci permit was given despite the widespread and strong objections of local officials, environmental groups and project residents. It does not ignore the cover and irreparable (irreparable) damage to the offshore mining in the ecosystem not only in the operation of the operation, but the wider ocean.
 </p>
<p>
  It will include 50 hectares of reefs and forests of seagrass of protected islands and oceans, such as the Palaui Island Protected Landscape and Seascape and Babuyan Marine Corridor. These areas are home to blood, whales and many other animals that are at risk of disappearing.
 </p>
<p>
  The company insisted that there was no harm to nature in their operations, although it was impossible in accordance with research and studies. The ocean and all the sailors are just drilling in the seabed to suck the magnetite sand underneath. It is also a major obstacle to disposal back to the sea of rocks and sand after the mineral is separated. Its ships are also at risk of communities on the coast of Gonzaga. In 2023, the anchors of the dredging ship were rescued by the powerful winds of Typhoon Egay. One of its supporting tugboats was thrown to the shores.
 </p>
<p>
  At the start of the operation, Gonzaga fishermen were banned from getting rid of the mine. Due to the effects of the previous black sand mining operations performed on the shores of the town, they were forced to stay away because no one was caught near the coast.
 </p>
<p>
  As a result, the entire regional security security is affected. Mining covers the municipal waters (15 kilometers of ocean from coast) which is a source of 60.2% of the Cagayan Valley fish supply.
 </p>
<h2>
  Mining on the veil of
  <em>
   dredging
  </em>
</h2>
<p>
  The Cagayanon added the impact of the Black Sand Mining of Riverfront Construction Inc. on the Cagayan River conducted on the "dredging" veil under the Cagayan River Restoration Program.
 </p>
<p>
  In the town of Aparri, the livelihood of the 11,000 citizens was overcome by the incessant operation of dredging ships and large ships carrying stone and sand to China. According to them, the activities of these ships create noise and excessive light, and dispose of chemicals that interfere with the ecosystem caused by the collapse of the number of fish and skin (small shrimp) which is the main source of their livelihood. The company is digging in areas where they are fishing, far from the scheduled area for dredging.
 </p>
<p>
  The fishermen have grown down since the "dredging" project began. From 200 containers to the last five days of a day, it would be fortunate if fishermen fill 50 containers. Also, the former 200 kilograms of fish late a boat in an overnight shovel became three kilograms. In 2021, their income fell to ₱ 300 to ₱ 1,000 pesos for a three -day break, far from the former income of ₱ 3,000 to ₱ 7,000.
 </p>
<p>
  It even affected the livelihood of the merchants. Prior to the start of the project, the bread and sellers of the last fish and other final fish and other final fish were up to ₱ 8,000. From 2021, their income has been less than ₱ 700 in 5-day sales.

  Large and foreign capitalists deliberately deal with the rights of workers to union and offer to keep the Philippine labor cheap and vulnerable. This is contrary to the reactionary state officials, stated by its own law and the international agreements that it has signed. It is only torture the formation of the union and insist to recognize them as an exclusive representative of the workforce.
 </p>
<p>
  This is the experience of Bokya and Bayong, both 39 years old and contractors even 13-14 years of working at a factory in Cebu.
 </p>
<p>
  Immediate reasons convinced them to join the union. "I was approached with a union for assurance at work that was not just to be removed," Bokya said. “At the time, it was hot until our (Labor) agency was just hot. This is the issue that first gathered us, ”Bayong said.
 </p>
<p>
  In 2018 the union was began to be built in their factory, but to this day the capitalist does not recognize it as the Sole and Exclusive Bargaining Agent (SEBA) or the only representative of the Workers' Workers. To prevent the union's formation, Maneydsment put members in "floating status" or removal of regular work rotation. The capitalist has been working for four times to kick the organizers.
 </p>
<p>
  The workers fought. They launched collective actions and insisted on opening the factory to the Department of Labor and Employment inspection to prove that the capitalist was implementing the labor-only contracting (LOC) scheme. They also insisted on returning to regular rotation workers put into floating status.
 </p>
<p>
  "We had a Armband protest, sent a letter to listen to but no answer," Bokya said.
 </p>
<p>
  Instead, the capitalist intensified, the state of the state, the pressure on the workers. It enters the NTF-ELCAC in the factory to conduct a porch where the union is redtaging. Union leaders were threatened and feared to have their families. Fascist agencies are still being held at Maneydsment meetings.
 </p>
<p>
  The work of the NTF-ELCAC was a shock to the ranks of the workers. "To overcome this challenge, those of us who are active in the union are housed from the workers, gathered them and trying to restore the (meetings) and our studies."
 </p>
<p>
  They continued the fight to recognize the union as Seba and assert the urgent requests of workers such as wage increases. They filed petitions with the labor agency to identify contractors as regular. Outside the factory, they joined workers who lost their regular income and in times of emergency.
 </p>
<p>
  "There was a help during the chronic placement of us in the" floating status, "and during the devastation of Typhoon Odette," Bokya said.
 </p>
<p>
  "During the pandemic, there was also cooperation in order to insist on providing assistance to government agencies," Bayong said.
 </p>
<p>
  In the process of building the union, Bokya and Bayong have been aware of matters of greater society, especially the state's widespread violation of human rights. "We are already involved in protests about government killings and harassions, in rallies against treading our rights," Bokya said. He also joined the relief drives for the devastated or burned workers' communities.
 </p>
<p>
  In personal life, they learned discipline, courage and militant. "My life has changed because I have learned a lot about what the real union really is, how to really fight and not be a capitalist," Bokya said. "I learned more about the principles, and not afraid of the maneydsment," Bayong said.
 </p>
<p>
  “Limit to drink,” Bokya exclaimed. "It's not too shy to speak and talk to understand others about our rights."

<p>
  At a hearing in Congress on February 29, the Confederation of Wearable Exporters of the Philippines (CONWEP) threatened the widespread removal of the clothing industry if even a small amount of wages to workers here would be awarded. In his letter to the Marcos regime, it warned that up to 120,000 or 70% -80% of its 160,000 workers would lose its job if any increase was passed to the Senate and Congress. They added 21,912 manufacturers set to be removed this year due to "weaker international demand."
 </p>
<p>
  Conwep is the association of big capitalists who are specializing in manufacturing clothes for the largest "global brand" (well-known brands in the world). These include Ralph Lauren, Coach, Michael Kors, Adidas, Dillard’s, Marks &amp; Amp; Spencer and Ann Taylor. It exports clothes mainly to the US, followed by European Union, United Kingdom and Japan countries. The association of foreign companies is dominant, of which the least has 1,000 workers. Two of the largest companies here operate 6-7 factories and employ 22,000-24,000 workers. These companies also have operations in other parts of Asia (Cambodia, Thailand and Vietnam). Prior to firing, it employed up to 220,000 workers.
 </p>
<p>
  Most of the workers in the industry are women, relatively young age, and contractual. In general, less than 17% -25% are paid to them compared to men.
 </p>
<h2>
  Diminishing industry, intensifying exploitation
 </h2>
<p>
  Since the 1990s, the Philippine clothing industry has become part of the international trade industry. By 2020, there were only 200 factories manufacturing clothing in the country, 240 traders and over 1,000 subcontractors. It employs more than 490,000 workers in various capacities, and a majority or 69.4% of these are women.
 </p>
<p>
  In 2020, the Conwep used the COVID-19 Pandem to implement widespread removal, reduction of wages and further labor lecture. It put thousands of workers in the "floating status" while others directly resigned. The factories are worse in factories under the Taiwanese Sports City International company, the largest employer in the Mactan Export Processing Zone. During the years 2020-2023, at least 12,000 workers lost their jobs when it moved the company's operations to its factories in Vietnam. The Conwep has released the "work on the jobs". In fact, retrenchments were conducted to maintain the company's profit level at the expense of Filipino workers.
 </p>
<p>
  Like other companies inside the engages, foreign Conwep capitalists enjoy unparalleled privileges and incenters. These include tax holidays, “duty-free” or tax-free entry of the necessary material, use of advanced infrastructure built using public funds, “flexible” manufacture, and subsidies for utterances (water and water and water electricity) and rent. They also enjoy the additional reduction of tax payments under the Create Law. It is not openly, but the "No Union, no strike," "
 </p>
<p>
  These foreigners are allowed to bring out their full income without responsibility to the Philippines. As it is already happening, its factories are closed in the Philippines without chasing workers.
 </p>
<p>
  In 2023, the Conwep recorded more than $ 1 billion worth of export. For 2024, the Foreign Buyers Association of the Philippines estimates that it will increase by 2% or to $ 1.33 billion due to the introduction of new orders.

  Within the Freeport Area of Bataan (FAB), the first export processing zone in the Philippines, women workers dared to fight against the FCF Manufacturing Corporation, an exclusive company that produces products for the global brand coach and Kate Spade.
 </p>
<p>
  They voted for the strike after the company stood up to ₱ 2 only this year's wage increase. This is despite the bullying of the Maneydsment that they will be transferred to work, or that they will be directly deprived. More than 1,000 agreed with the strike and 100 disagree with the factory with 3,000 workers (regular and contractual).
 </p>
<p>
  FCF workers receive only ₱ 500, 44% of ₱ 1,142 living wages in Central Luzon. In addition, workers' rights are also widespread such as forced leave, illegal removal, and inhuman labor conditions.
 </p>
<p>
  The strike is a disappointment of the company's open threat and repression. Prior to the polls, FCF's FCF and his brother's FPF company secretly met the workers on February 26th to support and campaign not to support the "strike vote." It threatened to transfer workers to reduce benefits or be consumed without receiving service fees.
 </p>
<p>
  The FCF is part of the Fashion Focus LTD, a China -based company. The products sell for ₱ 2,000 to ₱ 20,000 each. In 2022, the company earned ₱ 2.8 billion so it was impossible to have no ability to pay, according to workers.
 </p>
<h2>
  “Dirty” clothes
 </h2>
<p>
  The Garments industry in the Philippines, which includes the FCF, is part of the billion-dollar global industry that employ 60-75 million workers. It reaches 3/4 of these are women. Much of its manufacturing is in the backward countries of Asia. By 2023, its income was estimated at $ 1.74 trillion.
 </p>
<p>
  In a survey of the Clean Clothes Campaign group, 93% of the global brands or brands known worldwide do not pay the living wages to industry workers. According to Oxfam International research, less than 1% of the prices of global brands products will be reduced to their income if they implement living wages.
 </p>
<p>
  Excessive employment increases (up to 16 hours per day, seven days per week); unsafe working conditions (dense, no ventilation, and in the case of Bangladesh, rotten buildings); violence and abuse; widespread violations of rights in resignation and opposition; Forced employment; Working with children and discrimination with women.
 </p>
<p>
  In the International Labor Organization data, the clothing factories of gender and gender-based violence and harassment (GBVH) are notorious. In Asia, 22.8% of women working in the industry reported to have experienced a minimum of one type of GBVH in 2021.

<p>
  The 38th anniversary of the EDSA uprising is commemorated in various parts of the country and overseas through protests against the Marcos regime's Charter Change or Chacha on February 25.
 </p>
<p>
  About 5,000 people gathered in front of the EDSA Shrine in Metro Manila under the No to Chacha Network. According to the groups, one of the successes of the EDSA uprising was the 1987 Constitution, which banned political dynasties, set limits on the term of officials and other assurances that there was a "check and balance" in the state. This is what the Marcos regime wants to change, in conjunction with allowing 100% of foreign ownership to land, key infrastructure and facilities in the Philippines.
 </p>
<p>
  The alliance also believes that the Senate and Congress should take care of the people's grievances in wage increases, lower prices, better social services and much more, rather than chacha. In the unified alliance of the alliance, it is called "unnecessary, divorced, expensive, and focused primarily on maintaining the position of those in power."
 </p>

<div class="article__content">
<p>
  The US-Marcos regime is mistaken in the alleged masses' armed revolutionary resistance to the masses of the massacre of the massacre of the arrested five red fighters of the New People's Army (NPA) and party cadres in Barangay Campagao, Bilar, Bohol on February 23. Unsurprisingly, the martyrdom of the Five of the Five of the Selfishness who served their interests in their interests was a major loss to the masses in Bohol and the Filipino people. However, their lives and sacrifices serve as an inspiration for the ongoing struggle of the revolutionary struggle in the province.
 </p>
<p>
  Ever since the seeds of the revolutionary movement in Bohol in the 1980s were imposed, it has never been overcome by the reactionary state. Despite the repeated "insurgency-free" declaration, the Fire Revolution in Bohol has never been extinguished. Because oppression and exploitation remain, the revolutionary resistance to the island was not overwhelmed.
 </p>
<h2>
  Bol-anon masses
 </h2>
<p>
  The majority of 1.39 million people of the island suffer, especially the peasant masses. Rice and corn are the main products here, as well as coconut, bananas, cassava, saba and oil palm.
 </p>
<p>
  Of the total 482,100 hectares of land in the province, 273,950 are agricultural, and 101,271 are a forest. It is called the "food granary" of Central Visayas due to large food production. According to 2018 data, 26% or 70,117 hectares of agricultural land are rice fields. Of these, only 56% have enough irrigation.
 </p>
<p>
  Farmers are now fearing the damage that El Niño will bring to the rice fields. One of these farmers was Dad Boying, who was very worried about his garden because of a "dry spell" (low in normal rainfall) in Bohol.
 </p>
<p>
  "Irrigation is difficult because we only depend on the rain ... elsewhere irrigation, but only a few benefit, sports," he said.
 </p>
<p>
  This is very contrary to the Bohol local government's boast of November 2023 which provided ₱ 7.1 million to add to farmers and to be affected by drought. With the exception of the poor, there are many more requirements for the benefit.
 </p>
<p>
  El Nino will bring more losses to Bohol farmers. Daddy Boying complains that in the regular garden he is no longer earning, he will be overwhelmed by the lack of irrigation.
 </p>
<p>
  At least ₱ 11,000 he costs each plant cycle. He reaches 456 kilos or 12 sacks of rice, and will deduct 2 sacks in return to the landlord. If for sale, he will only earn ₱ 9,120 at the price of ₱ 24 per kilogram of rice. Because the rice prices in the market are so expensive, and the price is so expensive, Father Boying is no longer selling the harvest.
 </p>
<p>
  The greater catastrophe of the masses is the increasing and widespread land seizure of private corporations and landlords in the local government. These include the seizure of the Bohol Cattle Corporation (BCC), owned by the Marcos, on the 622 hectares of land fought by the Trinidad-Talibon Integrated Farmers Association (TTIFA). The BCC ignores the documents held by the farmers in its land seizure campaign that is part of the total 1,973 land it claims.
 </p>
<p>
  Farmers are also tortured by the existing plantation of the Oil Palm of the Philippine Agricultural Land and Mills Development Inc (PALM INC), owned by the Agumil Philippines company, which is a part of Filipino and Malaysian investors. In 2012, at least 2,500 farmers of oil palm were bankrupt because of the Palm Inc scheme that had a very high interest in the loan and a very low cost of its fruits. It only bought the farmers for ₱ 2/kilogram. Currently, farmers are unable to benefit from the land that was planted with oil palm because of the chemical used here. Palm INC covers 6,000 hectares of land for the plantation.
 </p>
<p>
  Fishermen are also drowning in poverty with 33% of the total population. They are lost due to the ever -increasing prices of crude oil, equipment and other expenses. They also fear that they will lose their livelihood due to the 650-hectare plan of the Panglao Island, and a reclamation in Tagbilaran City.
 </p>
<p>
  Far from the gastric of the masses Bol-anon is boasting the local government of 7.1% growth in the Gross Domestic Product of the Province in 2023 that came primarily from tourism. Despite the money that reaches up to one million tourists annually, the sweat masses in Bohol remain poor and hungry.
 </p>
<p>
  Meanwhile, if the masses are not hungry, the military and police have killed and tortured them. In recent years, repression of the Bol-anon masses has been constantly opposed to their land rights. There are currently 10 political prisoners in Bohol including 75-year-old Adolfo Salas SR, a founder of the founder of the Philippine Peasant Movement of the Philippines Movement to Hapong to Older (Claim-KMP). The 47th IB and the so -called Task Group Bohol of the Armed Forces of the Philppines and the Philippine National Police are main agents of state terrorism.

<p>
  El Niño's drought in much of the country is now in much of the country. It began in the middle of the past year, and is expected to last until May or June this year. It is expected that up to 65 provinces will suffer from drought and cause extensive damage to the country's livelihood.
 </p>
<p>
  By the end of February, it was reported to have reached ₱ 941.7 million worth of damaged crops due to damage to nearly 15,000 hectares of agricultural land. In studies, it is estimated that up to 250,000 hectares of agricultural land will be damaged. Hundreds of thousands of farmers are at risk of getting deeper into debt to commercial-USERUCTIONS, getting worse and hungry and hungry.
 </p>
<p>
  The drought that drought brought the drought to the farmer without their own land, there was not enough funds, rain and irrigation. Hundreds of thousands of farm workers will lose their jobs or income. As a result of drought, fires in the mountains, which endanger the life and livelihood of the minority masses.
 </p>
<p>
  El Niño's drought effects are worsening due to the destruction of nature, especially the loss of forest due to long periods of logging, mining and construction of dams and other infrastructure that destroy watershed and water sources. The large foreign companies and the comprador bourgeoisie are the main offenders of them. Despite the intense damage caused by them, the Marcos regime continues to favors the aggressive entry of this destructive company into the countryside.
 </p>
<p>
  El Niño has been expected to have been in the Philippines for more than a year this year, but the Marcos regime has no concrete plans to support farmers who can afford the livelihood. Although the drought would have been a long time, the agencies did not give the reactionary government a scientific advice, financial or alternative plants, and allowed the peasant masses to be destroyed and contaminated in the crops.
 </p>
<p>
  Worse, Marcos is now using El Niño to provide huge funds to earn money on infrastructure projects such as "solar-powered" irrigation that, if only, it is finally set up and nothing more At the height of drought and water drainage in many places. Lastly, cloud seeding plans, distribution of tractors, and small insurance or insurance in the damaged crops, have no media and insurance.
 </p>
<p>
  Despite the expectation of the fall of drought, especially the rice regime, the US-Marcos regime does nothing to ensure the supply of food, but to open the country's door for rice imports, as well as the onions, garlic, and other agricultural products. The price of rice has increased this February and is expected to continue to increase.
 </p>
<p>
  To deal with the intense impact of the drought because of El Niño, the Party and the revolutionary forces must strive to unite and migrate to the peasant masses in order to defend their well-being, livelihood and economic and social rights. The peasant organizations must be multiplied and strengthened to exert their strength to fight for immediate steps that will be unlucky during El Niño.
 </p>
<p>
  The farmer's masses should be widely mobilized to assert the necessary initiatives for urgent relief to them, including distributing the required funding or support support, postponement or cancellation of debt repayment, non-payment of land rent, and carrying out the Immediate solutions to solve the water problem. They must act together to fight the mines and other planting plantations.
 </p>
<p>
  They must also be exposed to revitalize the spirit of the peasant masses especially in the face of the drought. Through their organizations, widespread mobilization can be planned to cooperate the adjustment of the irrigation system in their respective areas, and sharing (rather than scramble) in flowing water in their fields.
 </p>
<p>
  The US-Marcos regime should collectively charge the US-Marcos regime for its excessive neglect, corruption and burdens of steps that exacerbate their condition. It all burns the anger of the peasant masses and drives them along the path of protest and resistance.
 </p>
<p>
  In the midst of the drought, the units of the New People's Army were assigned by the party to actively act to help the peasant masses keep up with the face of the fertilizer. In addition to sustaining their organizations, NPA units directly assist in production, digging wells, irrigation, and other initiatives in favor of the well-being of the peasant masses.
 </p>
<p>
  The peasant masses are increasingly angry that in the midst of intense drought, all thousands of AFP fascist troops are relentlessly launching extensive repression operations and armed offensives to occupy people's resistance. In the midst of their misery, hundreds of millions of pesos are being destroyed by the AFP in the middle of the jet fighter and helicopters to drop a bomb and explode cannon in the fields and mountains.
 </p>
<p>
  AFP battalions are now launching offensive nationwide, in accordance with the US-Marcos regime's order to defeat all guerrilla fields until the end of March. It does not bring anything to the peasant masses but more suffering.
 </p>
<p>
  The neglect, corruption and torture policies, and fascist terrorism of the US-Marcos regime have all served as a flaw in the dry straw of the town's anger in the vast countryside. The situation exists for widespread protests of masses in the countryside, and further strengthening the NPA armed resistance.

<strong>
   Mumbai, March 7, 2024:
  </strong>
  Dr G N Saibaba, (a former professor of English at Delhi University’s Ram lal Anand College), who had been sentenced to life imprisonment over his alleged links to the CPI (Maoist), was released from Nagpur Central Jail on Thursday morning, two days after his acquittal by the Nagpur bench of the Bombay High Court.
 </p>
<p class="no_first_intro_para">
  Addressing media persons on Thursday, Dr Saibaba (who is wheelchair bound and 90 per cent disabled due to a bout of polio) said that it was a wonder and “by chance” that he came out of prison alive. “My health is very bad. I cannot talk. I will have to first take medical treatment, and then only I will be able to speak,” Dr Saibaba told media persons after coming out of the jail on Thursday morning.
 </p>
<div class="ev-meter-content ie-premium-content-block">
<p>
   Hours later, while addressing media persons in Nagpur, Dr Saibaba thanked his legal team for “bringing out truth and facts” to get justice and said life in prison was “brutal”.
  </p>
<p>
   “Not once, but twice the higher judiciary confirmed that this case was without any legal basis and ten years of my and my co-accused’s lives have been lost. As a professor, I was at the peak of my profession and I was away from my students and class for ten years with an inhuman and brutal kind of life in prison. There was no accessibility and I could not move on my own. I could not go to the toilet and I could not go to take a bath without support. It is a wonder, it is only by chance that I came out of the prison alive today. There was every chance that I would not have come out,” Dr Saibaba remarked while addressing media persons in Nagpur.
  </p>
<p>
   “It’s due to the wishes of people in India and across the world and their struggle, that we could live despite such suffering and pain and the kind of atmosphere I was put in. Such restrictions were not even there for so called normal prisoners,” Dr Saibaba added.
  </p>
<p>
   Dr Saibaba also commented that he was “sad” that Surendra Gadling, his lawyer during the trial in the case, was behind bars in the Elgaar Parishad case.
  </p>
<p>
   “There is no other reason but the only reason (for his arrest) is he defended me during the trial and that is the only reason he was arrested… During my trial he (Gadling) was threatened and indications that he would be incarcerated were visible. They said (to Gadling) after Saibaba, we will see you. That is what exactly happened. If justice has to be fully achieved in my case, then Gadling should be released,” Dr Saibaba declared.
  </p>
<p>
   Dr Saibaba was arrested in May 2014. Other accused individuals had been arrested between 2013 and 2014 by the Gadchiroli police on allegations they were members of the Communist Party of India (Maoist) and its frontal group the Revolutionary Democratic Front.
  </p>
<p>
   Mahesh Tirki, Hem Mishra, Pandu Narote (who died in 2022 in jail due to swine flu) and Prashant Rahi had all been sentenced to life imprisonment by a special court in 2017 and Vijay Tirki was sentenced to 10 years in jail.
  </p>
<p>
   While Vijay was out on bail, the other accused persons were also released on Thursday.
  </p>
<p>
   Lodged in Nagpur Central Jail, Dr Saibaba had been convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment in 2017. On on appeal, the Nagpur bench of the Bombay High Court discharged the accused on October 14, 2022, saying there was no valid sanction for him to be prosecuted under the UAPA. It had also acquitted four others in the case and ordered their release from jail.
  </p>
<p>
   A day after Dr Saibaba’s discharge, a special sitting — based on the state government’s plea seeking a stay on the high court verdict — was held in the Supreme Court before a bench of Justices M R Shah (now retired) and Bela M Trivedi. It had suspended the HC verdict holding that the Nagpur bench had not gone into merits of the case.
  </p>
<p>
   In April 2023, the Supreme Court set aside the High Court verdict discharging the accused, and remanded the matter back to the High Court to be decided afresh by a different bench.
  </p>
<p>
   A bench of Justices Joshi and Valmiki SA Menezes had in its 293-page March 5 verdict pointed out that the prosecution failed to establish material and electronic evidence was legally seized and it was difficult to accept the accused had conspired and prepared to commit a terrorist act, which was not spelled out in the case. It also turned down the state’s request to stay the acquittal verdict, clearing the way for Dr Saibaba’s release.

<p>
   The communists sentence that to end the oppression of women it is essential to fight against the system that guarantees the division of classes and private property over the means of production; This does not mean that while that happens, women should not fight to achieve what they cry with fury and pain.
  </p>
<p>
   Imperialist capitalism is undoubtedly the latest possible exploitation system; With each change and progress in the development of productive forces and the means of production, exploitative classes have been in need of increasingly requiring more work force, especially women, in all fields of knowledge, knowledge, production, and even politics.
  </p>
<p>
   The communists also recognize that, in their attempt to delay their death, imperialist capitalism intensifies the rhythm and voracity with which it exploits and oppresses the working class, which aggravates the material and social situation of all workers. Hence, the terrible evils suffered by all women in the world, especially the women of the working class and the peasantry, are the product of that salaried superexploitation.
  </p>
<p>
   In Colombia this becomes evident every day: in the terrible working, social and life conditions to which women are subjected. Despite what the defenders and reformers of the bourgeois state say, in capitalism the woman is simply seen as cheap labor, easy to buy and superexpletar because the conditions of existence force her to undergo worse conditions.
  </p>
<p>
   Female unemployment rates (15.9% in January 2024) talk about the large number of women in need of a job, which causes that both factories, companies, state institutions, even in the streets, thousands of Women are willing to undergo strenuous days and low wages.
  </p>
<p>
   And what to say the peasant women, subject to work from sun to Sol most of the time without salary in the small plots, or receiving worse salaries than those of the day laborers or proletarians in the great agribusiness production.
  </p>
<p>
   The exploiters impose on women conditions that make their lives a hell: low salaries, exhausting days, sexual harassment in jobs, ill -treatment ... in the field also, subject to the war against the people that strips them, displaces them , they forced them, viola or kill them ... to which the thousands of unpaid hours of work are added in their homes, many sacrifices to cover the minimum of subsistence of them and their children. Of all this suffering, capital benefits, since domestic work is a fundamental part of capitalist exploitation, it serves to reproduce the labor force that capitalist parasites will be responsible for devouring in the future.
  </p>
<p>
   At these levels of exploitation over the women of the people, the terrible forms of violence to which they are exposed: sexual abuse, violations, physical violence, disappearances and femicides are added; Products of social decomposition, of spiritual and physical degradation in which the entire system has been sinking making the most reactionary and retrograde manifestations resurface against women.
  </p>
<p>
   This dying system, which deprives the women and men of the working people of their slightest rights, denies them living conditions for their personal fulfillment, time and resources for their education, their culture and rest; hinder the economic and social conditions that guarantee their physical and mental health. All these reasons make the capitalist system just be destroyed by those who suffer from their ills.
  </p>
<p>
   Therefore, all rage must be pointed against the exploiting classes that bleed women and men under the yoke of salaried slavery, and against their bourgeois state that guarantees the subsistence of imperialist capitalism.
  </p>
<p>
   That the fair rage of women becomes a direct and forceful blow against those above, an accurate blow that allows improving the living conditions of all women and advancing to the conquest of the power of workers and peasants to end to wage exploitation.
  </p>
<p>
   To advise that blow, it is necessary to form a revolutionary female movement that channels all the female force, not only to resist and face daily oppression and violence, but to direct it together against the entire bourgeois state and the exploitation system that Drowns the women and men of the working class and the peasantry.
  </p>
<p>
   A revolutionary female movement capable of joining on a single platform the main claims of women to conquer them with direct struggle. A revolutionary female movement that mobilizes women in the countryside and the city to force the fight in the streets, blockade, unemployment and strike that the State, representative of the exploiters, meets the demands of women.
  </p>
<p>
   It is essential to organize a revolutionary female movement that permanently mobilizes the women of the town, who is able to go outside in large blocks to face all manifestations of capitalist exploitation and social decomposition with which they are violated. Women should organize to fight the root of all the evils that overwhelm them.
  </p>
<p>
   In the case of proletarian women, it is necessary that they organize even more strongly, because the fight against capitalist exploitation suffered by women is inseparable from the common struggle of all exploited and oppressed against all the power of the capitalists. That the great revolutionary blocks of women are present in all days of struggle and demonstrations of the working class, to lift the women's platform against the superexploitation and oppression system that, as well as the rest of the workers, submits them to everything Type of vexars and humiliations.
  </p>
<p>
   We call all working women in the countryside and the city, the students, the unemployed young women to become revolutionary, conscious fighters ... to put themselves at the forefront of this task against all the conditions that reduce and violate politically, economically and ideologically to women . To build the revolutionary committees of women who shape the revolutionary female movement.
  </p>
<h5 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">
   Women against the State! Women against capital! Women against machismo, imperialism and employer!
   <br>
   Women as slaves, never again!

    28 days of prognosis with an orbit fracture and rifting of the maxillary breast. I repeat that these barrels were for me, my father if he had not intruded at this hour I would have died at least, I have never seen much hatred anger and fury released in a few minutes. Continue to deny that there are no problems in Italy and these are the results. Fasci in power, people who feel entitled to do what they want, racists on the loose, policy and carabinieri who make you feel even more dangerous than safe. I with my Italian citizenship today I clean my ass ...

<p style="text-align: justify;">

   With the words of Chirine who clearly give the idea of how the beasts that attacked her, to her and her father who immediately took the defenses, even between the indifference of some passersby, near the station on the Bergamo route Milan, they move well and feel perfectly at ease, supported in culture broth, in the countryside increasingly openly against women, racists, fascists, repressive, fueled by the black government of Meloni and its ministers, today in power in the country .
  </span>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<span>
   To Chirine companion very active in supporting the Palestinian resistance, to his father, all our strongest solidarity and support, best wishes for bruises and fractures they can heal quickly and without consequences.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<span>
   But 'they will not be a few blows to let us give up our ideas, to make us shut up. Very true and solidarity, when it becomes a target
   <i>
    Because you are a woman, because you are Arabic, because you bring the kefiah

   , can only turn into a greater charge and even more determination in all our struggles to overturn all this.

   They are also the Meloni government, the owners who in this country that build weapons, accomplices and responsible for genocide in Palestine; These monsters as our lives use for their profits, their reactionary, racist, repressive plans to prevent women's freedom; They are the same who want to crush the Palestinian people.

    The struggle of Palestinian women is our struggle,

   It helps us against this putrefied system, and the struggle of us working women is the struggle of the Palestinians because it weakens the imperialist monsters.

    Ponte Galeria: the hard complaint 
 of the Senator on the front line against the repatriation centers. Yasmine 
 Accardo (leave): "There is no protection of rights e 
 recognition of people who are imprisoned in these concentration camps 
  state. In Rome, the stop-cpr network is being born ”you are attempted suicide in seven days. The tension to the CPR of 
 Ponte Galeria salt day by day after the disorders of the last 
 month. A list of despair that stretches after protests for 
 The conditions of invivability inside the center for the repatriation of Rome. 
  A prison in all respects with high rallies closed cages 
 Over eight meters, reduced hygiene to light, solitude and despair 
 of those who are not even understood when he speaks
   </p>
<p>
    On February 27 the first case little by little
    <a href="https://roma.repubblica.it/cronaca/2024/03/03/news/proteste_ponte_galeria_cpr_anarchici_bomba_carta-422244938/">

   After he tried 
 to hang himself and transferred to Sant’Eugenio. “The reality of the CPR is one 
 reality that is now collapsing. In the last few days they are counted in Ponte 
 Galeria an average of an attempted suicide a day, practically one 
 massacre. Indeed the thrilling hypothesis is that migrants try suicide 
 Hoping to return to freedom because it is not suitable for life in community. 
 All this happens in the general disinterest but instead it is time to 
 tell them these places and demand that they are closed - says the 
 parliamentarian Ilaria Cucchi -. Three guests were declared not 
 suitable and wonders why they were in there. I will do everything 
 what is in my possibilities starting from a question 
 parliamentary. And as happened in the city of Ferrara, where 
 We paraded in 1,500 associations and civil society, we will continue 
  to do in each city to ask that the CPR be closed. "

<p>
    On February 29, three were attempting to end it 
 Always binding the sheets to the railings: Salhi Saber, El Maddahi 
 Othman, Mohamed Alì Eltayahi. On February 4th there was one 
 protest at the CPR for several hours following the death of Ousmana Sylla, 
 The 22 -year -old from Guinea, who was found hanged with a 
 Lip to a grate. The young man, before killing himself, left a 
 Message that is a testament: he wrote his name, his own on the wall 
 surname, his village of origin. And a prayer: “Please, 
 I report my body in Africa, I miss my country a lot, me 
 My mother is missing. Law enforcement officers do not understand anything, 
 Not even my language. I can't take it anymore, I just want my soul 
 rest in peace". During the disorders two were injured 
 military and arrested fourteen migrants.
   </p>
<p>
    On March 4, two were hospitalized at the Aurelia 
 Hospital and Sant’Eugenio. This is Barry Abdoulaye and Mohamed 
 Elbikri. Just from the latter boy, 23 years old, the count began 
 of attempted suicides because the girlfriend had tried to get in 
 Contact with the CPR to find out what happened to. "My boyfriend 
 Yesterday he got dressed in Ponte Galeria, was taken to the hospital but not 
 We have news. His name is Mohamed Elbikri, he asked to be 
 repatriated. In the last two weeks it was always under therapy almost 
 Sedato ”, the woman had written in a message to the associations. And and 
 came to the surface that Elbikri was not the only one who had in the last few days 
  tried to kill himself.
   </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    "Where there is no protection of the rights and recognition of people 
 which are imprisoned in this system of status concentration camps - he says 
 Yasmine Accardo, to leave -. To make that evident 
 violence do it with an act of violence towards themselves, to give 
 Meat to a body that is continually disconnected in this country. 
 We are very worried because despite years of complaints, the state 
 Continue to propose new detention systems. In Rome he is creating 
 This new network against CPR called "Stop CPR" and we will continue to 
  beat us "

 In chapter III of "What to do?" Lenin starts from the reaffirmation that there are two policies, tradunionist policy and social democratic policy; given that "
 <i>
  Economists do not deny politics but continuously deviate from the Social Democratic conception towards the tradunionist conception of politics
 </i>
 ".
 <p>
</p>
<p>
  The text then goes on to examine the importance of the economic denunciation and the sheets that deal with this. And the great attention that the workers pay to it. "
  <i>
   The truths about worker life in these sheets
  </i>
  - writes Lenin -
  <i>
   They were actually most of the time a declaration of war because their revelations caused a turmoil among the workers, incited them to demand the elimination of the most scarce injustices and aroused the desire to support their claims with the strikes in lot
  </i>
  ". And then he concludes:"
  <i>
   The economic complaints about the factories were and continue to be a remarkable tool of economic struggle. And so it will be the capitalism, who necessarily incites workers to defend themselves by himself
  </i>
  ... (they therefore)
  <i>
   They become the starting point of a awakening of the class struggle, the beginning of a working struggle and the spread of socialism
  </i>
  "Indeed, Lenin says that no one like the communists can and have to make these complaints."
  <i>
   These complaints can serve as a starting point and integral part of the social democratic activity (provided that they are conveniently used by the organization of revolutionaries), but they can also, if you submit to spontaneity, emerge in a purely "tradunionist" struggle and in a non -social democratic worker movement
  </i>
  ".
 </p>
<p>
  This is the point.
 </p>
<p>
  "
  <i>
   Social democracy
  </i>
  - says Lenin again -
  <i>
   He directs the struggle of the working class not only for
   <span>
</span>
</i>
</p>
<a name="more">
</a>
<i>
  Get advantageous conditions in the sale of the workforce but also to break down the social regime that forces the nulots to sell themselves to the rich. Social democracy represents the working class not in its relations with a certain group of masters but in its relations with all the classes of the company, with the state as an organized political force ... then
 </i>
 (the Social Democrats),
 <i>
  They cannot be limited to economic struggle, they cannot even admit that the organization of economic complaints is the prevalent part of their activity. We must actively deal with the political education of the working class, the development of his political consciousness ... but what should political education consist of? We can limit ourselves to spreading the idea that the working class is hostile to autocracy
 </i>
 (masters, government)?
 <i>
  Certainly not. It is not enough to explain to the workers their political oppression, it is not enough to explain the contrast of their interests with those of the owners. They must be made by the agitation regarding each concrete manifestation of this oppression. And as this oppression is exercised on the most different classes of society, as it manifests itself in the most diverse fields of life and professional, civil, private, familiar, religious, scientific, etc. activities, it is perhaps not clear that we would not fulfill ours The task of developing the political consciousness of the workers if we did not instruct us to organize the political complaint of the autocracy in all its aspects? Isn't it necessary to report all the concrete manifestations of oppression? All the manifestations of the police oppression, of the absolutist arbitrariness, of the corruption of officials, the fight against the hungry and the repression of the aspiration of the people to culture, science, the extortion of taxes of all sorts, persecutions, i Soldiete methods against intellectuals ... all these and a thousand other manifestations of oppression, not directly linked to economic struggle are means and reasons to drag the masses in the political struggle. Indeed, in the sum of the daily cases in which the worker must suffer from his lack of rights, arbitrariness, violence, cases of police oppression in the union struggle are only a small minority ".
 </i>
<p>
</p>
<p>
  Lenin's exhibition is all too clear to trace the discriminant between an mainly economic activity, linked to the economic conditions, and the political agitation of the communists and what the actual political struggle of the class depends on it.
 </p>
<p>
  Lenin rejects and invites us all to reject that the task of the communists is essentially giving the same economic struggle a political character, that the economic struggle is already a political struggle and that it is the method to bring the workers to politics. Not only that, but Lenin insists that giving the economic struggle itself a political character, aiming to meet economic claims, to improve working conditions with legislative and administrative measures, is what they precisely do and have done all the trade associations.
 </p>
<p>
  So it cannot be the main task of the action of the communists. Considering it such and concentrating all the activity on this, lowers the policy, activity and organization of communists at the level of tradunionist policy.
 </p>
<p>
  "
  <i>
   Revolutionary social democracy ... take advantage of the economic agitation not only to present to the government claims of all kinds but also, first of all, to claim the suppression of the autocratic regime ... it also considers its duty to present to the government claims not only on the ground of the struggle economic but on that of all the manifestations of political and social life ... how the part is subject to everything
  </i>
  ".
 </p>
<p>
  In this Lenin invites to distinguish propaganda from agitation, in a very simple and clear formula "
  <i>
   Propaganda must give in a word many ideas, such a large number of ideas, that as a whole they can only be assimilated by a relatively small number of people. The agitator at the opposite by dealing with the same question takes the best known example, to give the masses a single idea ... that of the contrast, for example, between the increase in wealth and the increase in misery, strives to arouse the discontent, the indignation of the masses against this strident injustice ... the propagandist acts above all with the writings and the agitator with the speeches
  </i>
  ".
 </p>
<p>
  And why there are no doubts, Lenin adds "
  <i>
   Finding a third field, a third function of the practical activity that would consist in the appeal to the masses for certain concrete actions, is the greatest absurdity, because the appeal as an isolated act or is the natural and inevitable completion of the theoretical treaty, of Propaganda booklet, of the agitation speech, or fulfills a purely executive function
  </i>
  a".
 </p>
<p>
  That is to say, Lenin fights every idea that the concrete action is the whole, how to subordinate propaganda and agitation to the concrete action; both because the concrete action of a propaganda booklet lies precisely in the diffusion and assimilation of the opuscule by the "few people" (lawyer reads) who can really assimilate it; both because the type of concrete action that arises from the agitation is different, if it is political or if it is purely economic. The idea of the concrete action goes well with the idea that it is only on economic issues that concrete actions can be developed.

  We welcome the common mass action of teachers and students at a Piraeus school against the "visit" of evaluator. Teachers and students have vigorously opposed to the attempt to legalize the Evaluation Ferries in schools, rather than against the universal reaction and resistance of the industry.
 </p>
<p>
  Because teachers know that evaluation means discipline and terrorism for the teacher in order to be a discipline of the reactionary education policy, whose victims are the children of the people, the students. They want us terrified to slaughter pupils as state employees the rights of students in studies. To "teach" them the submission to the "National Baccalaureate" slaughterhouse and tomorrow's work without rights. We know that evaluation means class categorization of schools and teachers.
 </p>
<p>
  Successful joint intervention proves:
 </p>
<p>
</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>
   That the fight against the assessment attack is alive and can escalate!
  </li>
<li>
   That the theory that "we do not have the students with us" is propaganda of the opponent and is rejected when students and the people understand who are the real victims of this class policy, which shapes an increasingly hostile education for very few and very exquisite.
  </li>
<li>
   That every race moves other data in our relationship with the people!

   It is never redundant to remember the 
 Amnesty International investigations, which have shown how access

 while in Gaza before 7 October 97% of the water was not

<p>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This year on March 8 who is approaching is a special March 8, it comes 
 After the large demonstration of half a million people, the 
 Stragrande majority women and girls, who was there on November 25th 
 in Rome who expressed a force, a potential of struggle, of 
 Women's units, which really great.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  And therefore 
 This year on March 8 it must be - and it will also be - one 
 mobilization with the women's strike at the center, one 
 vast mobilization that will be in every city, from North to South, to 
 center, in every workplace, in every neighborhood, in every sector 
 in which women work more and more exploited, more and more 
 discriminated against, more and more oppressed.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  We want 
 Place two realities at the center of this March 8. On the one hand the reality of 
 workers, of the workers who in recent months, in this past year but which will continue in a very heavy situation in which the 
 Loss of jobs is becoming an almost normal way 
 which above all is also involving the workers of the greats 
 factories. At the same time, beyond the data and
  <span>
</span>
</p>
<a name="more">
</a>
 complaint 
 that appear in the newspapers, the condition of enormous differences, 
 wages, duties and rights of the workers, always falls 
 lower.
 <p>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But nevertheless 
 This, in recent months, also workers, the workers, have never 
 stopped fighting and do not stop, they cannot be stopped.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Often theirs 
 struggles, their needs, their conditions, are not visible, not 
 are the subject of news of the mass media or when they are needed 
 To get scored data, to make commitments every now and then, without then 
 These commitments are made in the least.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Indeed, the problem 
 that what is happening to the condition of proletarian women 
 contains all the oppressions a little, all the attacks that there 
 They are towards the set of women and we would also say towards the whole 
 of workers and popular masses.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Women 
 they continue more and more to be discriminated against salary, though 
 By doing the same job, carrying out the same duties as men, they continue to 
 Take less.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Those who on 
 print, but also by the masters, by the squalids 
 government ministers, raise these wage discrimination like this 
 like discrimination with respect to the work possibilities of whom 
 has stable and non -ultra precarious work, they do it with a purpose that 
 The solution worsens, as when some related journalists say 
 to the mastery to raise wages to stop denatality. So it 
 The purpose of these complaints, of these "solutions" to women 
 workers is not to improve their condition, but that 
 that if they take more, perhaps they will make more children, and there is no mention of the 
 problem of how to keep any children.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The whole campaign 
 On the birthday, to make more children, it is expressly linked to the fact 
 that women must return to play a central role for this 
 bourgeois system, to a central role that sees them committed to doing 
 children, engaged in the house, engaged in the care/assistance of the 
 family. So anything but to meet needs, to needs 
 absolutely fundamental of proletarian women but to make them go 
 back, to make them go to a modern Middle Ages where the problem is 
 that if women have children are "weighed"+ even for the miserable 
 bonuses, for incentives to the masters if they take women who have 2, 3 
 children etc.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Instead women 
 who have no children or they are alone, these have no right, not 
 They are almost considered people.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This condition 
 of women, a condition that is not only practice, but that it is ideological 
 and cultural, etc., is going to tandem with an increase in violence 
 sexual, feminicides.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  It can be said that 
 Now the data and statistics that were a year ago of a woman on 
 Three killed, in reality they are clearly increasing, they are overcome by a low intensity war than sometimes 
 It is striking the workers, as often in the latest feminicides 
 it happened.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  And how does the government respond to this? The government responds with more police 
 above all, with more secular measures that do not solve 
 At all, that the feminicides do not stop at all. Indeed, not 
 Let's forget that even among the last feminicides - for example 
 those of Latina - These, but many others also were committed 
 by men of the armed forces, by policemen, finance guards, etc.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  So, together 
 to the campaign for the birth rate, to have children, arms to be exploited, 
 new arms for capital and above all arms, meat, for the 
 wars that gradually increase and increase the role of ours 
 imperialism, Italian imperialism, this then goes together 
 Attaching to the right of abortion on which there are some signs but 
 The future also promises to be truly black.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  All this is 
 a fascist use that produces, feeds a modern patriarchism of 
 hateful males who react by killing, when women don't want 
 Being submissive when they want to break the ties.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But we in 
 This March 8th we want not only the complaint, anger 
 for everything that is falling on women, on the condition of 
 in particular life of the most exploited and more oppressed women, 
 of poor women, but we want to bring an element of rebellion, of 
 struggle, of trust in the possibility of not passively suffering everything 
 this, but to be able to fight, to be able to defend oneself immediately from 
 measures, from politics, by ideology, from the attacks that 
 they are on the agenda, but above all fight to overturn 
 this reality, because all life must change, overturn it with 
 The only possible weapon also for women - indeed even more so for 
 Women - with the weapon of the proletarian revolution, in which women 
 They bring, precisely because of their condition, not an oppression, but total oppression as such, bring an extra gear.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  And in this the 
 workers, the workers, are the center of this battle, because 
 they are together and know the value of the unitary struggle, 
 they know the value of the strength and therefore they are the ones who have more 
 interest, more possibilities, to take a struggle in hand 
 collective and therefore must go beyond the trade union struggles that 
 they already do with the disputes to carry on a general struggle that 
 be also avant -garde and example for all women.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  In the same 
 time this March 8 is an internationalist March 8, is a March 8th 
 Which is fully on the side of Palestinian women.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This March 8th 
 Palestinian women are at the center of solidarity by the 
 Italian women and women of all countries.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Women 
 Palestinians are massacred to tens and tens of thousands, they are the 
 70%, together with the children, of the dead for the genocide that continues 
 undaunted to carry on the Nazi Zionist state of 
 Israel. But at the same time these women massacred, hungry, that 
 they see their children killed under the bombs or died of hunger, from thirst, due to lack of medicines, which cannot give birth because 
 hospitals are bombarded, which are forced to abort for 
 road, however these women carry on a resistance that 
 It is truly an example for all the women of each country and for us.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  In this sense 
 We want to strengthen our support - and on March 8 this must 
 be concrete and visible - participating, bringing this 
 solidarity in every strike of women, in each 
 initiative/mobilization and where it is possible, especially to 
 North, in Milan, in Lombardy, bring it visually to the new 
 event that will be there for Palestine on March 9th.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  We think that 
 the link between women in women should be more concrete, stronger 
 fight, the workers in the first place and the Palestinian women, both because it is 
 Our Meloni government, are our masters who are those who 
 they build weapons above all, which are the accomplices and managers 
 of the genocide in Palestine. These monsters, as our lives use 
 For their profits, their reactionary, racist, repressive plans, 
 To prevent the freedom of us women in this country are the same 
 who want to crush the Palestinian people and women. Fight 
 of Palestinian women, therefore, is our struggle, helps us against 
 This putrefied system is the struggle of us working women, it is 
 The struggle of Palestinian women, because it weakens ours 
 Imperialist monsters.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  That's all 
 This will be the center for us on March 8. The companions, the 
 workers of the revolutionary proletarian feminist movement in 
 city where they are present will make the workers' strike, in 
 particular in factories and in various jobs, as well as 
 Other initiatives.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This year 
 actually we are focusing the most important initiative 
 right in Milan/Bergamo, both as regards the factories, the 
 workers, who also in recent months have continued to fight both for 
 regarding solidarity with Palestinian women. So in 
 This sense we appeal to all workers, workers and 
 To women to take this important March 8 in their hands.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  And then 
 We will continue more and more, and even more to fight.

  On the morning of March 2, the Ceará Front of Support for Palestinian Resistance promoted an important agitation “in memory of the more than 112 murdered in the Flour Massacre, by the end of Zionism and the Assassin State of Israel and in defense of the Palestinian people and of the Palestinian National Resistance ”with microphone, Palestinian flags and pamphleting.

   In addition to the hundreds of distributed pamphlets, part of the masses spontaneously demonstrated support for agitation, with sayings such as “Live Free Palestine!”. He captured special attention to the denunciation of the coverage of communication monopolies, which, like the great minions of imperialism, approached the flour massacre as a "confusion."

  A Palestinian man who went through agitation gave his active support to protesters. In a private conversation, he revealed that his sister still lives in the West Bank and is under constant threat of the hordes of Zionist settlers.

  In the speech, the Ceará Front of Support for Palestinian Resistance stated that it is the duty of all Brazilian democrats and internationalists to defend the Palestinian people and their national resistance. They also stated that pro-Palestinian mobilization should be intensified in the country, with agitation, leafleting, public debates and demonstrations.

<p>
  The situation in the two large industrial groups, the arcelrmittal, from 
 Today in extraordinary administration and Melfi's Stellantis, 
 should concentrate the attention of the trade union movement, 
 confederal and basic and workers in general, because they are around 
 to the events of these two large factories, two great complexes 
 industrialists present in several Italian cities, the game is played 
 of the general recovery of the workers' struggle, which as always 
 We consider fundamental for an authentic class unionism e 
 To give workers and popular masses, an inevitable point of 
 reference in the more general struggle against masters and in particular 
 against this government.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The decree that 
 introduces the extraordinary administration in the Acciaierie Group 
 of Italy passed the first passage in the Senate and, in the next 
 days, with the approval in the Chamber, he will have completed his process. 
 This decree enjoys the support of all confederal unions, 
 According to different shades. In this it must also be considered the 
 position of the USB which is of substantial support, albeit with distinction, al 
 government decree. If we look at things, from the point of view 
 of workers and workers immediately appears that
  <span>
</span>
</p>
<a name="more">
</a>
 Slai is right 
 Cobas for the class union in Taranto, who said during 
 All this period - and also says it in these hours - that 
 The extraordinary administration is not the solution, but, indeed, it can 
 be a worse remedy for evil.
 <p>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  And in fact 
 What are the immediate consequences? than with the Administration 
 extraordinary we witness the replay of a story traveled over the years 
 past, that is to say the insolvency of Ilva, in bankruptcy 
 substantial, which is discharged on the workers, in particular of the ILVA contract where this download produces in the companies 
 of the contract for a situation that, to put it with an euphemism, 
 according to the declarations of industrial associations it involves 
 of the contract, layoffs, permanent layoffs, a 
 Combattorio worsening of working conditions if it will be succeeded 
 to resume the work.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The devices 
 financial, administrative, inserted in the decree do not escape the 
 basic question that the masters, the names of the contract e 
 of the survey in general, they will not have the money that they say they are advancing 
 from Italian steel mills. The administration commissioner 
 extraordinary is proposing to the companies to resume work 
 paying him in advance the future works, those who resume, but not 
 they give any kind of insurance regarding the previous. 
 In these conditions it is difficult for many of the contractors to really resume work and, indeed, to follow, to the 
 contrary, after the generalized request for layoffs, 
 the announcement of collective layoffs.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This involves 
 Many problems also for the direct workers of the steelworm, where 
 Already in this month they are found with two paychecks, one up to 
 period in which this company is steelworks of Italy and another in 
 new period since it is commissioned.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Two pay slips 
 that, far from being a technical problem that can be remedied 
 Since the next few months, it is a spy of a more substantial problem: that 
 Fine is the previous workers? It is also inserted in the 
 picture of the insolvency, in the liability, and therefore payable it is not known 
 when? And secondly, what happens to the holidays, why 
 ArceloRormittal in recent months had transformed into the cashier 
 integration the holidays and as a consequence 
 Workers still have many holidays to consume but are faced with a different corporate structure. This as problems 
 immediate.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Much more serious 
 The problems on the future we will talk about in shape appear 
 widespread in a public meeting in Turin on Monday that opens one 
 National campaign of the Slai Cobas for the class union for 
 clarify the matter and return it to workers and workers, 
 First of all by Taranto, but also of the other Ilva plants and the universe of national steelurgery and the entire class 
 factory Girl.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  So let's give 
 Appointment to the report-report of the 11marzo assembly a 
 Turin, also organized with the collaboration of Medicine 
 democratic and the lawyer Vitale who takes care of the civil parties in 
 "Educational environment" process. Of this story and how much it 
 affects in the general Ilva affair at national and local level, 
 We will speak widely on the occasion of this assembly.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  On the question 
 Stellantis must instead overthrow the speech, start not from 
 government/owners diatribe which will however find its own solution, but 
 of what is materially happening in the factories.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  In Melfi the first 
 Problem is, also here, the contract, in Mirafiori and Polignano is 
 the announcement of employment cuts and we had the story of the 
 death at work in Pratola Serra.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Much “meat a 
 Cook ”, as they say. On this we are supporters 
 of the workers' autonomy, of the establishment of the establishment for 
 establishment, of the forces necessary to counter the Government Plan e 
 masters, of a connection network of them, of an intersindacal type 
 and basic, which can allow a common action of the most part 
 advanced and combative of the working class.

    Bar and Bench
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   Saibaba was first arrested in the case in May 2014, but he was granted on bail twice. He has been held in the central prison of Nagpur since a session court sentenced him on March 7, 2017.
  </p>
<p>
   A Court of Judges Vinay Joshi and Valmiki Sa Menezes annulled the sentence of a session court that had sentenced the defendants in 2017. In addition to Saibaba, the Superior Court acquitted Mahesh Tarki, Pandu Pora Narote, Hem Keshwdatta Mishra, Prashant Rahi, Vijay Nan Tarki. Narote died in prison on August 26, 2022 because of the swine flu.

   The application of the Maharashtra government that requested a six -week suspension of Saibaba's acquittal and the other five, Live Law reported. The State Government's request states that it has been addressed to the Supreme Court against the verdict and that the application of the judgment will create serious repercussions.
  </p>

   , arguing that a Gadchiroli session court accused Saibaba by virtue of the provisions of the law (prevention) of illegal activities without the sanction of the center. However, the order was

    Maharashtra government
   </a>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   On April 19, 2023, a Chamber of the Superior Court composed of Judges MR Shah and CT Ravikumar annulled the Absolution and returned the matter to the Superior Court for a new consideration.
  </p>
<p>
   Saibaba, who is in a wheelchair and has a disability of 90%, was convicted by a court of first instance in 2017 for allegedly having links with the proscribed Communist Party of India (Maoist) and a frontal organization, the Revolutionary Democratic Front . He had been sentenced to life imprisonment.
  </p>
<p>
   In its 2022 ruling, the Superior Court said that the order of sanction issued to process the accused in the case in accordance with the provisions of the Law (of Prevention) of illegal activities was “bad from the legal and invalid point of view ”
  </p>
<p>
   The court had said that although the State must fight terrorism with "unwavering resolution", a democratic civil society cannot sacrifice due legal process for the perception of a danger to national security.
  </p>
<p>
   Last year, the special rapporteur of the United Nations, Mary Lawlor, had said that Saibaba's persistent detention by India was a
   <a href="https://scroll.in/latest/1054685/gn-saibabas-detention-is-inhumane-and-senseless-says-un-special-rapporteur" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" target="_blank">
    "Inhuman and meaningless act"
   </a>
   that should end.
  </p>
<p>
   Lawlor, who has been in contact with the Indian government in relation to the case, said that UN human rights experts have repeatedly raised serious concerns about their processing. His arrest was declared arbitrary by the UN working group on arbitrary detention in an opinion issued in 2021, he said.
  </p>
<p>
   "Mr. Saibaba has been arrested in a high security barracks in incompatible conditions with his status as a wheelchair user," said the UN expert. "Its 8 × 10 feet cell has no windows and a wall made of iron bars, which exposes it to extreme climatic conditions, especially the scorching heat of the summer."

  A few days ago, at the Pére Lachaise Cemetery in Paris, France, a beautiful tribute was held to fallen companions, which are considered heroes of the international proletariat. Dozens of people with red flags marched through the streets to the cemetery to set up an emotional honor guard in memory of those who gave their lives serving the revolution.

  The Yankee Ambassador in Moscow, Lynne Tracy, was summoned on March 7 by the Russian government to deal with “interference attempts” and “subversive actions” in internal affairs in the country. The measure was announced while the Russian government is preparing for the next election period, scheduled for March 15-17, and amid intense international tensions between Russian imperialism and the United States (USA) in around military issues.
 </p>
<p>
  At the meeting with Tracy, the government also required the Yankee embassy to cease support for three NGOs in the country. The request was based on the suspicion that organizations are involved in "anti-mischievous programs" to "recruit" agents of influence "under the pretext of educational and cultural exchanges."
 </p>
<p>
  To complete the new milestone in increasing tensioning between Russia and US imperialism, Putin's government has said it will not tolerate interference in internal affairs, and that repression of such activities may include “expulsion as' persona non Grateful for USA Embassy employees involved in the action. ”
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Internal tensions and external tensions
 </h4>
<p>
  The new friction of diplomatic relations, related to internal issues of the European country, occurs at the same time as Putin and Biden have been enacted in increasingly intense pugnas at the international level, especially on topics related to the military issue.
 </p>
<p>
  One day before Tracy's call, the same foreign ministry had stated that if the United States positioned nuclear weapons in northern Europe, it would consider deposits as "legitimate targets."
 </p>
<p>
  "The person does not have to be a military strategist to realize that such facilities will represent a source of direct threat and, of course, will inevitably be included in the list of legitimate targets in a direct military conflict scenario between our country and NATO," said the Folder spokesman Maria Zakharova.
 </p>
<p>
  The new statements about nuclear weapons occurred after the Finnish President claimed that Finland could act as a “true nuclear disadvantage” in the region if supplied with American missiles. Finland was integrated with NATO in April 2023. The movement was seen as an advance of US imperialism to the desired siege around Russia, with the ultimate goal of establishing an anti-missile belt around the country.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Nuclear threat
 </h4>
<p>
  There are also other movements that have expanded the pugnas between the imperialist powers and superpowers. Earlier this week, Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov stated that Russia had captured audios by German military talking about the use of Taurus missiles in Ukraine. For Peskov, the recording confirmed the direct involvement of imperialist countries such as Germany in the war.
 </p>
<p>
  The conversation spoke of the potential use of missiles on targets such as the Kerch Bridge, which connects the Russian continent to Crimea, attached by Russia in 2014. Russian imperialism took advantage of the alleged leakage to expand the propaganda that imperialists in Western Europe plan a war Secret against Russia and that the war of aggression against Ukraine is "justified." The German reactionary government, in turn, denied the version.
 </p>
<p>
  Already the week before, Putin had raised the tone after Macron referred to the sending of troops to Ukraine. In response, Peskov stated that if shipping occurred, a war between Russia and NATO would be "inevitable," and that "mere discussion" about shipping "is a very important new element."
 </p>
<p>
  The “new element” actually indicates that there is no indication of reversal in the sharpness of imperialist pugnas. With the deepening of the general crisis of imperialism, the tendency, also proven by the increase of military investments in Europe (comparable only with those in World War II) is the increasingly wars by the globe, especially in the form of wars of prey, Like that of Ukraine, but with possibilities to also evolve to open imperialist wars, even as a secondary tendency.
 </p>
<p>
  In the same discussion, Putin went further and stated that he would not hesitate to launch the nuclear letter in case of sending NATO troops to the assaulted European country. "It has been talked about the possibility of sending NATO military forces to Ukraine," he said. “They must understand that we also have weapons to attack targets in their territory. Every tactic they invent and use to scare the world invokes a real threat of a conflict involving nuclear weapons, which would mean the destruction of civilization, ”he concluded.

<p>
  When the theme is a journalist murder, it is natural to think of countries like Mexico, Colombia or Ecuador. When the news is about legal curtailment and censorship, the newspapers of the media monopoly soon highlight countries such as India, China, Russia or other Eastern European, Southeast Asia or Middle East territory. Brazil usually passes out of both and another. But in recent months alone, in Brazilian lands, a journalist has become the target of an inquiry by the Federal Police amid a persecution promoted by a Zionist entity, two others suffered search warrants and seizure by the Civil Police as part of a persecution promoted by Governor Colonel of the State and the Federal Supreme Court (STF) advanced with discussions about censorship in discussing a broad and subjective legal thesis that provides for the overthrow of journalistic interviews and fines to press professionals in case of false or “injurious” content released by the interviewee. It is no exaggeration to say that journalists live in Brazil, still in times of censorship and persecution.
 </p>
<p>
  According to data from the National Federation of Journalists (Fenaj), legal curtailment to journalists grew 92.31% in 2023. The figures jumped from 13 shares or inquiries recorded in 2022 to 25 by 2023. In the opposite, violence dropped out almost 52% in the same period. Thus, persecution follows, but in new forms: instead of being targeted direct violence, promoted by celebrated hosts, journalists are now mainly surrounded by a more sophisticated persecution, promoted directly by state institutions.
 </p>
<p>
  Lawyer André Matheus, Master of Law, partner at Flora, Matheus and Mangabeira office and member of the Brazilian Lawyers Human Rights Commission - Rio de Janeiro (OAB/RJ), gives an even broader view: “It's the Normal new. Our office takes many processes, we have 300 and will reach 400 only involving press freedom and communicators as well. It is growing in all states of the federation, ”he told the report.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Tycoon and colonels against journalists
 </h4>
<p>
  Matheus explained that, most of the time, processes are moved by politicians or large entrepreneurs, who use devices such as judicial harassment or misuse of important instruments such as the special court to prosecute journalists. It is common for these figures to be associated with the far right or other reactionary sectors. Movements such as MBL or tycoon like pocketist Luciano Hang are some of the figures behind this series of lawsuits against press or communication professionals.
 </p>
<p>
  Special Civil Courts are characterized by the absence of costs to the accuser and the speed in the proceedings. In this form, the accused is also required to attend the accused's scene for the hearings. Fundamental instrument to allow ordinary individuals to move processes against large companies without having to bear the large costs of the process, this type of court is widely used in undue processes against journalists.
 </p>
<p>
  While some cases, especially in central cities and against more visible journalists, gain a certain repercussion, such as the case of journalist and writer João Paulo Cuenca, the target of 144 actions filed by pastors of the Universal Church, other cases, especially in interior states and against Independent vehicle journalists, pass the way.
 </p>
<p>
  “We are just talking about some cases that appear to us, but in the interior of the country we reach cases in the Amazon, Legal Amazon, Midwest, Northeast. It ends up arriving for people great portals, but also small, and these little ones suffer more because they have no money to pay. If they suffer a minimum conviction in the court of $ 3,000, $ 4,000, for them unfeasible. It is the money that will earn for months there. But it's new normal, ”he insists.
 </p>

<p>
  An emblematic and current case of persecution against journalists in this region is that of Alexandre Apá and Enock Cavalcante. Journalists from Mato Grosso, both have been tormented for years by the state governor of the state, Mauro Mendes, the first lady and the son of the politician.

  Apá explained that the persecutions against him began more than 10 years ago in 2011, when he produced the first reports that explored the illicit or at least questionable activities of the current governor, at the time still mayor of Cuiabá. The materials explored the bids made by Mendes in the mining business. In the amount of about R $ 9 million reais, the contracts were won by a partner of the mayor, and carried clear evidence of arrangement. “From then on, he has already created a very sharp animosity against me,” says Aprá.

<p>
  The climate of intimidation was not enough to stop Apá's investigative journalistic work, which launched the production of two series of reports that revealed evidence of fraud in auctions of the Regional Labor Court (TRT) with involvement of Mauro Mendes as a bump of the auctions. As a result of the revelations, two judges were targeted by disciplinary proceedings and were compulsorily retired by the TRT in a trial that ended unanimously. Mendes was also the subject of lawsuits for participation in the alleged fraud, but managed to file the investigation.
 </p>
<p>
  From there, the governor-colonel increased the retaliation. He moved criminal complaints in the judiciary for crimes against honor, then compensation and, finally, began to articulate the raids of the Civil Police against Alexandre Apá. One of the delegates involved in the case even asked, without solid foundation, the pre -trial detention of the journalist.
 </p>
<p>
  The persecution made a new leap in 2021, when journalists Alexandre Apá and Enock Cavalcante published a note showing that a state publicist, holder of the MT government's advertising account and involved in open bids in the period, presented the first lady of the state with a jewel. The note had clear evidence of the present: proud, Virginia Mendes published a photo of the ornament
  <em>
   Instagram
  </em>
  , and the material was used for the complaint. The note reverberated and the bid was canceled.
 </p>
<p>
  About two months later, Alexandre Apá was warned by a businessman that a private detective from Campo Grande was in Cuiabá to pursue him, and had hired an assistant to help him. It turns out that, as revealed by
  <strong>
   Public agency
  </strong>
  , the detective's assistant was also an investigative journalist who learned of the case and decided to cover. The journalist recorded and filmed the detective meetings from the beginning, and soon found that the detective was hired by the publicist involved in the bidding at the request of the governor and the first lady, both bothered by the work of Apá.
 </p>
<p>
  “Over the course of a few days, this assistant continued to recording the detective, until then to do this monitoring service. Over the days, he realized that it was not just a monitoring. The detective said they would forge a flagrant pedophilia against me, or a flagrant drug trafficking, planting drugs in my car. In one of the detective's speeches that was recorded, he said that they actually wanted to kill me, but they had aborted the plan and wanted to follow in the line of reputation murder, ”Aprá explains to the program
  <strong>
   By the way
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
<p>
  Realizing the severity of the case, the journalist provided all images and recordings to Apá. This, in turn, passed on the certification of images with a video editing professional and, finally, reported the case to the Federal Police (PF). The PF denied that the case was its attribution and went to civilian. In his hands, arose by Mendes, two inquiries were opened: one of them, the accusation moved by Apre; in another, the accusation of
  <em>
   fake news
  </em>
  moved by Mendes against the journalist.
 </p>
<p>
  Despite all the tests, neither Mendes nor the detective were punished. Recently, the Federal Prosecutor's Office (MPF) has offered a criminal transaction process for detective. In it, the private investigator would pay an amount of about $ 6,000, would be delivered from the case and would not have to reveal any of the contractors.
 </p>
<p>
  Apra, on the other hand, is still a victim of the poorly called “Operation Fake News”. On January 10 this year, Apá and Cavalcante were, together by publicist Marco Pinheiro, targets of a search and seizure warrant issued by Judge João Bosco Soares and executed by the Civil Police. In a clear violation of freedom of expression, freedom of the press and the constitutional guarantee of the right to the confidentiality of the source, the police seized cell phones and
  <em>
   notebooks
  </em>
  of journalists. The situation was reversed on March 6, when, almost after two months of struggle, press professionals managed to pull out of the Supreme Federal Court (STF) a decision that reversed the search against journalists in "Operation Fake News."
 </p>
<p>
  It is an obvious and very serious case of coronelismo, in which all local powers have turned against journalists in the service of a governor's family proven to be involved in suspicious schemes. “Unfortunately it is a difficult scenario until we can defend ourselves, because all the institutions end up involved in this plot,” concludes Apá.
 </p>
<p>
  In addition to Apre and Enock, about 16 other journalists accuse Mauro Mendes of political persecution in Mato Grosso.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Covered murders
 </h4>
<p>
  The persecution of journalists, covered or fostered by state institutions does not cease in the legal scope. In conversation with the
  <strong>
   AND
  </strong>
  , lawyer André Matheus resumed the important case of journalist Pedro Palma, murdered in Miguel Pereira (RJ) in 2014. In this case, several irregularities were committed in the process, and elements that could have been used to discover the principals were simply lost in the process.
 </p>
<p>
  “He talked about the City of Miguel Pereira. The crime was investigated there first, then was made here at the Niterói Homicide Police Station and the process in 2015 stopped, ”explains Matheus. He also said that that year he entered the team in the case to produce a report and asked the family to file new steps, which made the process again.
 </p>
<p>
  In the course of investigations, some irregularities were perceived. One of them, related to the Base Radio Station (ERBs). ERBs are fixed stations that connect cell phones to telephone operators, and can be used to track apparatus in certain regions. “The journalist had been killed in an area, the ERB of that area was requested, he took, the operators sent to the police station and was never appreciated. It seems to be lost in the middle, ”he says.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Grave picture
 </h4>
<p>
  In a nutshell, Matheus summarizes the country's picture: "There is a great violence against journalists in the country, both physical, but also the deaths." In the context of censorship, he is also striking: "There is censorship in the country, both previous and later."
 </p>
<p>
  For him, there are certain things that could be done, at least to start changing the overall picture. Deaths of journalists, according to Matheus, should have highlighted investigations, treated as a case of wide national repercussion. This is important above all when taking into account the involvement of the so -called “local powers” in these episodes.
 </p>
<p>
  In the case of censorship, judicial harassment and misuse of special courts, Matheus argues that one should work on paths to avoid these devices, such as the concentration of multiple processes moved against a single journalist in one case, a single court, to Avoid the numerous trips a press professional needs to make in current cases of judicial harassment.
 </p>
<p>
  But none of this is done by the government or the state. Last year, the STF - currently regarded by some as the supreme of democracy in the country - approved in trial a legal thesis that expands punishment about journalists in case of wrong or injured information said by respondents. The decision was condemned by entities such as ABI and Fenaj.
 </p>
<p>
  The National Congress also discusses a project that seeks to expand three times the penalty against journalists in information on the Internet. When considered that, today, most newspapers, especially popular or independent, survive through portals
  <em>
   online
  </em>
  It is a direct threat to the ruling of existing press freedom in Brazil.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Central targets and solid allies
 </h4>
<p>
  In the midst of this whole picture, there is no doubt that the progressive and democratic journalists, active in the complaint against the crimes of those who are lords of the nation, will be the most targeted in this silent war in which it is valid from judicial persecutions by official roads to Campanas, harassments and murders by the unofficial paths. After all, press persecution never occurs absolutely, not even in the most authoritarian regimes. At the end of the day, the facinoras also need their spokesmen in the media, even to mystify reality and to ensure the maintenance of the old order of exploitation and oppression. More than a century ago, a Russian revolutionary chief has already made the ever -valid lesson that freedom of the press never ceases to exist: the question is for whom it exists, and for whom it does not exist.
 </p>
<p>
  To the journalists of the people, it is the need to know how to act on this tortuous terrain without illusions with the committed institutions that are with interests unrelated to those of the people. In this battle, the most solid allies are and always will be the popular masses, unbreakable defenders of democratic rights and freedoms.

   Ballad (in memory of a suicidal poet)

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">

 </h4>
<p>
  On last 25/02, a man posted himself before the embassy of Israel in Washington, the capital of the United States. Previously, he had written a will leaving a refrigerator full of beers to a friend and trusting his cat's care to another. Their economies, began them to the Palestinian Child Assistance Fund, a voluntary medical help organization; And it stated that, after his death, his ashes would be kept until they could fertilize the soil of a free Palestine.
 </p>
<p>
  Continuous act, he set fire to himself. The news ran the world, as well as its last words:
 </p>
<p>
  –
  <em>
   My name is Aaron Bushnell. I am a member of the United States Air Force in active service. And I will no longer be accomplice of a genocide. I am about to surrender to an extreme act of protest - but compared to what people have spent in Palestine in the hands of their colonizers, it is not that extreme. This is what our ruling class has decided to be normal. Palestine free!
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  At the targets of the protest that led to this sacrificial gesture, Bushnell left a capital problem. Having in the Unconditional backing of the US the only guarantee of its existence, one of the few things (perhaps the only) that the state constituted by Zionism in the busy Palestine cannot be allowed to have against itself the public opinion of the country that it vetoes, alone, all attempts to make the UN order the end of the massacre.
 </p>
<p>
  Counting only with Israel as a mayor in the Middle East; And at the same time hostage to the Zionist lobby in its own instances of power, the US political caste, in turn, has no way to justify its own people the abject subjection of the greatest power in the world to the bloodthirsty whims of an ethno-state whose racist and genocide essence can no longer be tergiversate.
 </p>
<p>
  If, until then, the atrocities perpetrated in Gaza only hurt the moral and humanitarian sense of millions of US, the death of a 25 -year -old compatriot, military engineer, son -in -law's son -in -law of any mother -in -law
  <em>
   wasp
  </em>
  It leads them to feel much more closely the consequences of these crimes covered by their government - a feeling that also reaches millions of other citizens, hitherto indifferent.
 </p>
<p>
  In the US Armed Forces, malaise is old and growing with unconditional support to Israel and its atrocities. Amazingly, this may seem to those who discern the role the US meets in the world, much of its population believes, in good faith, in the propaganda about the values of justice and freedom that its state says to defend - and such a mistake leads many American to the military career. When the illusion falls apart, many degrade; But from among those who remain righteous, the Ellsberg, Manning and Bushnell arise. For an ethical tradition that has roots in the quas and its uncompromising rejection of slavery, the US people are an inexhaustible source of objectors of consciousness and
  <em>
   whistleblowers
  </em>
  - Figures that combine beliefs in service to the community and the importance of individual action, both equally rooted in their culture. It is to avoid its proliferation that the US is increasingly locking its wars with mercenaries.
 </p>
<p>
  The expression of this discontent, however, was, until then, to critical articles or videos made by reserve military, such as Scott Ritter. Bushnell proposed - and to some extent, it was - to be the spark that burns the prairie: his gesture has generated a picture never seen before, with the participation of military in demonstrations across the country. Some burn their uniforms in public,
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clsmpIU7cb8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   Others protest dressed with them
  </a>
  ¹.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">

 </h4>
<p>
  The death of the young officer and the commitment that guided it seems very much to those of another brave and altruistic American who, in 2003, at the age of 23, delivered his life fighting in a non -violent way against the crimes of Zionism: Rachel Corrie. It is surprising, and only explained by the damage that the incessant overlap of images and stimuli causes memory and reasoning that it and this obvious resemblance have not been remembered immediately.
 </p>
<p>
  Admittedly, Corrie did not die in her own hands, but kicked by the Israeli army by placing herself between the house of a Palestinian family and the military excavator that would demolish her. But differences weigh less than background similarities.
 </p>
<p>
  The largest of them: the decision, common to both, to put the convictions and justice above life itself. Such a force led Bushnell to go resolutely toward death and Correi accept it as a possibility by exposing himself to Zionist cowardice and cruelty. He was sure of his end and consciously sought him; She knew she risked, not because Israel's army was legitimate running over her, but because she knows that he acts without sticking to criteria of justice, morals or legitimacy.
 </p>
<p>
  To say this is not, as it is commonly said, to blame the victims: it is to recognize the heroes. Bushnell and Corrie are not victims, they are heroes.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">
  3
 </h4>
<p>
  It shocks and hurts to think of such young and valuable lives so early. Those who are able to surrender thus to a righteous cause would be able to, alive, do many valuable things.
 </p>
<p>
  The sense of injustice and something out of place is also inevitable; Bushnell and Corrie should be alive, and Zionist criminals should be dead.
 </p>
<p>
  However, they soon give way to the understanding that some (rare) times a life finds their fulfillment in their own sacrifice. And that both have achieved - much more than most of those we remain alive - to establish “the noble pact between the bloody cosmos and the pure soul,” in the words of the author of the epigraph.
 </p>
<p>
  Among the lessons that the heroic acts of both teach or remembers, it is to die of old in a bed is not always the best ending a human being can long.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">
  4
 </h4>
<p>
  Both gave life in acts of peaceful resistance: Corrie has committed no act of violence against someone, Bushnell only against himself.
 </p>
<p>
  This is not opposed to armed and/or violent actions: Bushnell himself, as a military man, had assumed the possibility of killing in a war as much as to die.
 </p>
<p>
  Pacific resistance is not the opposite of armed resistance, with which it has a common denominator expressed in a common word requires as much conviction, action and commitment as it is, and is closer to it than the warm policy-political policy that unfolds to the base of conchavos in cabinets with air conditioning.
 </p>
<p>
  Nor should it be confused with the pretense of equidistance that washes his hands equating the Zionist colonizer who has already exhausted the catalog of war crimes and against humanity, the Palestinian National Resistance and his armed actions - recognized, in addition, as legitimate by International Law .
 </p>
<p>
  The method chosen by Bushnell and Corrie is not replicable on a large scale: under exceptional circumstances, it can be of great value, and they dignified it.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">
  5
 </h4>
<p>
  The meaning of their sacrifices, however, is only complete through the action of those who remain alive. Their gestures denote full confidence in humanity and challenge it.
 </p>
<p>
  His luminous examples call us a greater commitment and serve to raise consciousness and fight to another level. The reactions of admiration and wrath against the crimes of Israel that awaken worldwide, starting with the country that saw them born, show that the point of non-rector for Zionism approaches, and that their sacrifices will not have been in vain .
 </p>
<p>
  May the roots attached by them in our consciences be firm and deep.
 </p>
<p>
  PS: In December 2023, a woman, wrapped in a Palestinian flag, had been on fire to the Israeli Consulate in Atlanta, also in the US, but being rescued and taken to a hospital. More information - such as its name, occupation and age - has been hidden by local authorities. To her, whoever, the same recognition here expressed Bushnell and Corrie.

Therefore, they are attacking and bombarding houses knowing who and how many children were inside. My name is Josephine Guilbeau, I am a 17 -year -old military veteran. I recently left the Armed Forces last year. Having this experience as an intelligence officer and understanding what is really a defense, I can clearly see that this is not self -defense. Civil casualties are a catastrophe. They are aiming at homes full of children. The elite sitting in the capitol lies more, and more, and more. I just want to point out that one of the greatest awareness I think I had in recent weeks coming here and lobbying with senators and congressmen [for a ceasefire] was precisely the understanding of how corrupt our government is and that Anyone who is in the Armed Forces is simply a piece of chess that they use at their own beauty for their own internal benefit, to protect their own interests and their money. ”

  In connection with March 8, the comrades have also published a statement where they write, among other things, that March 8 will be characterized by the Gaza genocide and the Palestinian people's heroic resistance struggle. The comrades end the statement like this:
 </p>
<p>
  "8. March is not a day to celebrate femininity or to congratulate each other on gender equality. March 8 is a fight day against imperialist war, against double suppression of the working women, to strengthen women's struggle and organization, against patriarchal culture and violence against women. Women show all over the world's heroism and strength in the fight. We know that this match will eventually win, and we will mark March 8 with enthusiasm and match glow. ”

  AND 
  Of these hours the news that the prosecutor of Piacenza, Matteo Centini has 
 the closing of the preliminary investigations relating to the investigation 
 game back in 2018, and which in August 2022 had led to 
 house arrest against Aldo Milani, Mohamed Arafat, Carlo 
 Pallavicini and Bruno Scagnelli del Si Cobas and similar measures 
 against some USB unionists, on charges, among other things, of 
 Association for criminal: this suggests that, with each 
 probability, there will be the indictment.

    Recall that in the summer 
  of two years ago, at the same time as the imposing mobilizations of 
 workers Si Cobas, the freedom court of Bologna decided to 
 revoke any restrictive measure against companions, considering 
 The accusation of criminal association is completely unfounded, built 
 artfully to the sole purpose of stopping conflicting unionism in one 
 cities such as Piacenza and in the sector like that of logistics in which 
 The vast majority of workers turned their backs on 
 CGIL-CISL-UIL state unionism, to join the SI Cobas or ad 
 Other acronyms of basic unionism.
    <br>
    It must also be remembered that 
 Against the provision of the judges of Bologna, the Public Prosecutor of Piacenza 
 has appealed four times, and in all cases such appeals 
 they were rejected!
    <br>
    Therefore, although the all -political character of 
 This theorem has been widely unmasked, this has not slowed down the 
 Prosecutor of Piacenza from pursuing his purpose of criminalizing the 
  Yes Cobas and his managers, for the mere fact of organizing 
 strikes in defense of workers and not having folded the head to 
 masters.

  Sarandi Metropolitan Hospital staff have been without salaries for months. The situation has revolted the workers, who protested on January 18 against the violation of rights, and mobilized all the people in the region, concerned with the possible closure of the unit. At the end of last year, SUS maternity service was interrupted, forcing mothers from all over the region to travel to other locations for basic care.
 </p>
<p>
  According to complaints ascertained by the corresponding location of
  <strong>
   AND
  </strong>
  , the Sarandi Metropolitan Hospital has delayed the salary of doctors, nurses, nursing technicians, janitors and jams.
 </p>
<p>
  An employee of the hospital reported to the report that the late payment has been taking place for a long time. He informs that the doctors were the first affected and that they would have been six months without a single penny, and that in recent times this has expanded to all staff of the hospital. There is no forecast for payment. In addition, there are also widespread complaints about the lack of inputs and medicines.

<p>
  Signaling that the situation will last, the hospital published, on February 15, a note stating that the salary for January this year would have a greater delay than expected, due to alleged problems with one of the main bank accounts responsible for the payment of salaries. In addition, in the same note, the hospital claimed that it would provide “assists” and a salary advance.
 </p>
<p>
  The publication was rejected by the workers. In the comments, one of them stated wryly that “when paying my bills I present this role and everything is resolved. Shame".
 </p>
<p>
  Faced with calamity, the hospital previously threatened employees in case of strike: one of the hospital nurses said the hospital coordination sent a statement to employees warning that if they stopped working, everyone would have to respond to the code of ethics.

<p>
  On February 17, the hospital published another note, stating that at least 40 hospitalized patients ICU (Intensive Care Unit) were transferred to other cities such as Maringá, Ivaiporã, Umuarama, Campo Largo, Cascavel, among others, due to “low employee availability ”.
 </p>
<p>
  Faced with this statement, an employee reported that the hospital has always had fewer employees than the ideal. Exemplated that, on many occasions, several nurses had to take over 3 to 4 patients in the ICU. This is just another proof that it is unsustainable for these employees to work without being sure when they will receive their proper payments. This same employee made a point of emphasizing that he is since last month without paying his bills, due to the high interest rates charged for the delay of payment, which is the reality of most of the Sarandi Metropolitan Hospital.

  According to APP-Syndicate, most of the 700 employees are late. Those who earn less received $ 900 in two installments of $ 600 and $ 300. Debts with workers would be at $ 2 million.

Because it is not enough to read the news, it is necessary to have a critical conscience, of partisitimanal n ° 14 Israel fired on the "crowd of hungry". As the newspapers write 'shots on those looking for bread. The ambulances were not enough. Many bodies of deaths and wounded were loaded on carts pulled by donkeys, others (article on page 3) The security package at the work of Meloni/Calderone is not a response to the emergency dead the massacre in Palestine and the war of the people need Ria (continue on page 5) Police status! Ignoble to the police, the bloody faces of girls, women, small with the police manganelli under the Rai headquarters of Turin as in Vicenza, in Naples and in the face of the massacre of Florence, in the face of the massacre Infinite of workers in the workplace, to the lack of security that is a constant, to contracts, to precarious councils, the blackmail of the residence permit for immigrant workers linked to employment contracts, the black lady, to the bass Salari, all elements that are part of the exploitation system that brings profits to the masters and misery and accidents and, often, the death at the work of the workers, on the wave of anger and pain aroused by the massacre after the collapse of a gigantic Shipyard in Florence that killed 5 workers, the Government has had enough dead at work down his hands from our boys! (He continues on page 2 police offices in Pisa on the elections in Sardinia on page 5 <br/><br/> 2 Also audio on podcast podcast on Spotifyvia the police government especially in Pisa. Here a procession of the students has been made a sign of a repression that someone has paid to that of the G8 in Genoa: boys beaten by cowards as the police are knowing how they are built to do these things. Of course, beyond individual responsibilities - which are not few, because the cops are fascists, they are ver - me, they are beasts and show what they are made of when the bridle is attached - those policemen who beat are Cowardly beasts who have raged on uncomfortable young people but certainly not unwary and certainly not disarmed with a will of position. They made it dirty, the videos showed him without a shadow of doubt and in the newspapers we have to read of blocked ambulances, laughter during the barrels, ostentation of violence, arrogance. Guys treated as criminals. From who? By the state criminals represented by that charge stopped immediately by the protection cord. This time the press was unable to do without filling the pages of complaints, of photos. Some did very well to actually represent the treatment reserved for beaten students. It is such an evident and dismissed thing that President Mattarella, a "secular pope" of this country, could not fail to stigmatize, pronouncing words that evidently raised criticism to the police bearing, to the behavior of the Minister of the Interior, to Government and advised the government not to pursue this path because it could serve not so much to stop manifestations of young people but, in fact, the classic fire…. And whoever has a certain age know how to end the situation. But Mattarella was also taken in fish in the face, to eat words, first of all represented by that manous dog who is called Salvini who was able to declare without any modesty that those who criticize the police is a crime and therefore, in fact , Mattarella himself also gave the delinquent. But apart from some hesheings - nament of the first day after these positions, the government yesterday claimed everything. Meloni: “The manganelli? We do not apologize, this was by right ”. No, this has been of Police, this is modern fascius, this is attack on the elementary principles of freedom, manifestation, thought and action. The prosecutors say: "Who gave the order?" But who had given order to Turin? Who had given the order to Naples? Of course, if you cannot do the events or you should do them a thousand miles where there are the symbols of these events, if you transform each manifestation into a kind of fence-lesson, it is clear that when you want to get rid of these absurd prohibitions and affirm a true and legitimate protest loads you with blows and then of complaints. In Pisa he went badly because Pisa took the field the next day to defend His boys, our boys. And even the unions, which are usually embarrassing for their silence, could not fail to say "enough with the batons" and that the minister must resign. But the minister's request for resignation showed the nature of this government. These ministers do not resign, did not resign, the santanchè has not resigned, that kind of caricature of minister who is Lollobrigida, do not resign all these dirty people, filthy, fascists inside and above all rich and above all and above all Corrotti who are part of the system of the rich and corrupt in this country, of the Patrasites and therefore do not resign because they know that that system are linked to an umbilical cord, they are the sewer mice returned to power that holds their hand And they won't go to anything and maybe they can't go with their feet. Here, Pisa shows that state violence - the police state - is one of the forms of the modern fascism of this government and that for this reason it is necessary to fight it. Fight it, fight it, fight it. (continue from the first) <br/><br/> 3 of the only "security" for the Meloni government is the impunity for the assassin masters drawn the confederals to communicate to him what has already decided the Minister of Labor Calderoni - Consultant of the owners now appointed mini - to then bring to the Council of Ministers A measure that is an outrage, an insult to the workers who died at work and that leaves the masters alone, allowing him to continue to be able to deny the security by exposing workers to the risk and to make it frank for this. Moreover, Meloni herself had explicitly declared that her government "does not put brakes to those who do". So no novelty in the conception of this government that puts its class matrix in every provision, the defense of the interests of the masters at the center of its policy, which carries on their class war with the contempt and hatred towards the - Vorators who also expresses in this case when he is forced to intervene because there are the deaths and accidents of the workers. But it is precisely because from this government it is not "northern novelty" that the struggle must be organized, putting it on the field with all the means, organizing the unit of the work - rators, make it pay dearly to the masters and the government. The news of these days is that the Council of Ministers approved a scheme of decree-law on the current PNRR, a sort of "omnibus" decree- with about fifty articles (49 in the draft attached to the article) and which contains this package security at work in which there would be various "news". The minister says that this provision follows the three C: "Controls, contrast and compliance for an ac- area to regularizations, to a regular entry of companies". Meanwhile, the first insulting novelty is its scope of application: this is a measure that limits its action only to construction sites and not to other work sectors, from factories to warehouses to countryside. The same minister of labor and social policies, Calderone, recalled in his information to the council of the ministers of 21 February - after the worker massacre on the construction site in Florence - which "as regards the inspection access in construction, the level of irregular - registered Landity was 76.48%, with an average irregularities rate that exceeds 85.2%in the case of corporately engaged in works connected to the superbonus 110%". The Government therefore recognizes that the violation of the safety rules and contracts in the construction in the opposite direction exists instead of increasing controls with criminal penalties for contracts and subcontracts, instead of canceling the waterfall contracts, repeal the Salvini decree that liberalizes The contracts. The provision says that the hiring will be unlocked to increase the contingent of the work inspectors, the carabinieri inspection nucleus and the inspection of INPS and INAIL which may increase the checks by 40%. The government's propaganda announces another 766 work inspectors, but which in reality these are 466 hires that will be unlocked (on the basis of an old competition with the Draghi government) and 300 new hires, 250 of all these should be intended for safety And on health at work, 50 are carabinieri under the inspection structures, which on the national level, in relation to the 4,500,000 companies surveyed - only those registered, therefore - will not change absolutely nothing regarding the controls. But the heart of this provision is the notorious "points license". After the workers' massacre of Florence, the general secretary of the CGIL, Landini, responding with only 2 hours of strike, had said that the institutions and the government must intervene in order not to allow more than others workers. “The points license must be set up. Companies that do not respect the rules must not be able to work, they must be closed, they must not be able to participate in contracts. Instead, those who respect the safety rules must be privileged. " The government union, government, CISL also appreciates this tool which- underlines the Semi-Greek Luigi Sbarra- corresponds to a substance to an advanced proposal in 2003 by its union. The Meloni/Calderone/Salvini government took them in question to hit the working conditions of the construction sites. The license is issued by the National Labor Inspectorate after registration in the company's Chamber of Commerce and provides for the fulfillment, by the employer and workers, of the training obligations; possession of the DURC, a single document of (continues from the first) <br/><br/> 4 fiscal and the risk evaluation document. And here it is so facilitated this documentation for the masters, the DVR is even prepared by themselves that they define where and what the risks in the workplace for workers would be. The driving license to do - it should enter the function - nor from 1 October 2024. For the company or for the self -employed worker without the license or with a number of credits of less than 15, the administrative sanction from 6 thousand to 12 thousand euros is triggered. The initial score is 30: in the event of an accident, Mor - 20 credits are reduced, while for permanent disability it drops to 15, 10 credits are deducted for temporary disability. But this is an insult to dead workers and all workers the passage of this provision which provides that the reduced credits can be recovered with training courses! Other than the tightening of sanctions, as announced the propaganda of the Meloni government, it is the year, even more hateful amnesty to the masters because it concerns the life of the workers. We reported in a previous worker counter -information after the massacre of the construction site in Florence: "How much is the life of a worker worth?" And the government, with this provision, responds in a chilling way that for it "is worth 20 points" but in reality, as we have seen, also nothing, for - because a training course is enough to continue as before! The cascade subcontract remains. The only positive note is that the social clause is introduced which also provides for subcontracting the application of the most used contract in the sector, but is only valid for the remuneration, not for the regulatory part as the obligations to the formation - ne, the working hours, etc. Minister Calderone says he introduces "the criminal offense for the illegal interposition of labor", in cases where the labor is administered without there being a regular contract contract and a regular staff detachment, this on the one hand, But at the same time civil sanctions are reduced, in the event of violation of the safety rules, it is enough to get in order. And to all those companies found in order, a certificate will be issued and registered (subject to consent) the employer in a special IT list that can be consulted publicly and called "Inl conformity list". The owners, to whom the certificate was issued, thus will not be subjected for twelve months to further checks in the objects of the ascertains. Nothing changes for the workers of the Palla. No provisions to enhance and extend the function of the RLS and the representatives of site safety as well as no inspection and health station in large companies, in construction sites, to ports, as the Slai Cobas claims for the class union with the struggle in realities in which we are present. No provision on wages, precarious contracts, on the breakdown of the link between residence permit and work, which are the claims of the struggles of the basic unions. The USB for months has been collecting the signatures in support of a law to introduce the crime of murder at work and to present it to the presidents of the Chamber and Senate, because the discussion arrives in parliamentary classrooms and so the Fillea herself, the union of the CGIL construction , also appeals to the political forces to modify this provision in Parliament. How can we trust that something changes in parliament? The same opposition that was in government yesterday never did anything to intervene against the deaths at work. The CGIL launches a referendum with the collection of signatures (it will take 500 thousand) and the possible vote in spring 2025. "On the field to change the wrong laws and propose another social model and to develop" against Job Act, layoffs, precariousness and contracts. But when never the issues concerning workers' conferentations have been conquered with a referendum? The escalator was perhaps not Chancel with a referendum? The story evidently continues not to teach or in any case the confederals make other choices as conciliators with the interests of the masters The USB has organized a demonstration with a cor - Theo that started from Piazza Dalmatia towards the Long Site and also a conference in Florence in which the introduction of the murder crime at work is discussed. Certainly returning to the scene of the massacre is a deception that we share. But the problem is always that: who will have to make the laws that are unexpected the penalties for the assassin masters? <br/><br/>  5Sulle elections in Sardinia we do not think that the elections are currently the tool to change things, just as we do not think that the elections in our country are king - to the democratic; They serve, instead, as Marx says, to choose between candidates who have to do the interests of the dominant class and this applies to the center -right candidates as well as for center -left candidates. This has also become clear to the substantial masses of the population, of Proletarian, of the poor masses of our country, so much so that the natural response to this situation was the massive abstentionism. The political system of the parties in Italy and the governments that are born from them are all governments at the service of the and of the dominant class and in general what they say in the elections is not realized. Everything they promise to the proletarians and the Mas - if, is not realized. Everything that promets - tone to the masters and the dominant class is realized. Not only that, but once they are in power they do it without any scruple: "It is the vote that sent us to power, it is the vote that allows us to do, in the end, all we want". Now the elections in Sardinia They are not different from the elements of all kinds of type that we have had in recent years, nor will they be different from the future elections. We are for a new really democratic state - tico in which proletarian workers, the popular masses can freely elect the Their representatives in a picture in which, however - it is clear - that the interpretations of the proletarians and the masses must prevail over - the interests of the masters and exploiters, of the parasites. This possibility is not in the current electoral system.com, however the electoral result in Sardinia is a political result to be carefully evaluated. Two factors seem important to us: the parties of Go - Verno, through a clash between bands between them, gave birth to a candidate who was defeated in substance. The center -right candidate was imposed by Meloni. So it is also a personal defeat of Meloni and the party that represents him. It is also a defeat of the coalition for the League to fire and flames before the elections for the candidate Solinas to remain the candidate-president, then Meloni was imposed with the support of Forza Italia and the candidate Solinas of the League is was set aside. As a concrete outcome, an evident part of the Elective - Rato della Lega voted the lists but did not vote for the candidate of Fratelli d'Italia. It is not that we think that the League candidate was better, Solinas is a offender, he is a Candi - Data also investigated by the judiciary for the way he managed the Region, for the link with illegal affairs. Everything that feeds the division into the government, in the domi-Nante class, is today positive. The vote in Sar - worthy of expression, in the band of those who voted, a no to the government the candidate Todde, unlike other candidates from the center -left, at least in the electoral phase, was characterized by a more radical position at the local level, In Sardinia, and opposition to the national level - nal against the Meloni government. Rightly this candidate spoke of fascists to the government and rightly appealed to the antifhea - Scisma against this government, coming out of Mrs. Meloni, an irritation that disturbed a significant part of the electorate. It was the full solidarity with the students attacked in Pisa and the complaint of the management logic of public order as a police state. This vote has weakened the government, for now, but for us the social and political opposition is the one that moves Outside the Parliament, it is the one expressed for example by the 100,000 who showed and striked on 23/24, around the nodal question of Palestine. The social and political opposition is the one that moves - ve in the jobs, in the territories, to claim wage, rights, the defense of the health of safety in the workplace in front of the gigantic chain of deaths, is the one that rekindles i Focola di Ribellione in schools in solidarity with Palestine and in Gene - Rale to question the school model that wants us to impose the Fascists to the government and their minister Valditara. It is that of the movement of women who with great manifestations-now on March 8-is putting the general strength of women against the policies of this government, within a criticism that certainly goes beyond this government . This social and political opposition must be built and organized in political forms: the Prospet Party - Riato, of the oppressed, the united front of all those who fight this government, the state of happening - the construction of a force of the masses capable of Do not allow state violence to the owner's face. <br/><br/>  6 myths to all their action. Who Seeds wind shall harvest storm! The conflict between imperialism and oppressed peoples will not stop today and tomorrow and we will carry it behind for years, in the history of humanity. Of course, we would all like "the abolition of wars", of all wars. But here and now, we must stop a genocidal war, to support those who resist you that they need to do their against/war of the people. Stopping the Israeli regime is the interest of all the peoples of the world and certainly not only for "solidarity with Palestine" but because it is a outbreak of infection within a general trend to war that touches all the territories in stages. And this concerns - from our country it concerns us. It concerns us as masses, we as proletarians, we have always been involved in the struggle for the oppressed against the oppressors, in our country as in the other parts of the world the Meloni government is an accomplice. An investigation by other Economy writes: "Italy has counted to arm Tel Aviv". Israel has always received weapons from all the imperious countries, with the arms merchants par excellence, the-war state that is American imperialism, from the various European imperialist countries, from the war industries- behind every war there They are profits and war is a great business of the weapons markets. The investigation concerns the period after October 7th. Other Economy has consulted Istat. On the few cars available, others still on trailers, trucks that had brought humanitarian aid. The shooting was indiscriminate. The Israeli soldiers fired the head, to the gams, to the abdomen. A massacre, a massacre without alibi. A massacre on the Palestinian masses that the Nazi Zionist state of Israel and his soldiers are trained to consider "animals" with human appearance. So they see them and therefore it can be fired as in a hunting trip. Nobody really knows how many Palestinians have been killed. A first figure speaks of 114 and is a downward figure. Many are in serious conditions, transported where it was possible, taking into account that in the Gaza strip there are no hospitals in operation, they are without everything and even part of the injured are certainly at risk of life. He shot himself on humanitarian aid, that is, he shot himself not only on the Palestinians but on all those who help them sending food, clothing. Israel has shot you who are solidarity, to you who do not share what is happening, that does not condition the genocide, which does not share the absolute impunity that this state has compared to fundamental laws, human rights, UN resolutions , even to the laws of war. An out of law since birth, in its constitution -, which is believed to be in a position to do everything above and outside the law. Of all this, the massacre is a page and it is not even the final page. It is a massacre that comes from many actions of this type, from a 75 -year -old occupation that has produced, phase in phase, massacres of this type and horrors of this type. This current war against the Palestinian people is the summa, the recapitulation of all wars. That's why a massacre without limits, to a warless war, is not possible that the oppressed have li- (continues from the first) the massacre in Palestine and the war of the people Neces Saria <br/><br/> 7critic of weapons. The peoples who want peace and justice and do not want to live under this oppression must necessarily overthrow governments, the states, which produce all this, as part of the gigantic struggle for a different destiny of humanity. This is up to everyone. And even if you believe yourself, you are all involved. And this is the war that can allow the improved - to the situation of the world, the war of people can put an end to the endless horror. The War of People in Palestine. The war of the people of the oppressed against imperialism. The war of people in our country, against our government. The great event in Milan on 23 and 24 February were two important days. Two days that saw 100,000 - and in May- Room workers - take to the streets in all forms: the 23 strike was important for example in the sector of the Logistics, but also in some factories of factories from Piaggio to other minors, there have been demonstrations. The workers took the field, took a position and it is important that the basic and class unionism, in all its different acronyms, has collected the appeal of the young Palestinians who, in the disagreement with when it happens in the Gaza Strip And in the West Bank, they had called a strike and demonstrations. 100,000 as they have not been seen for years. Far left-left militants and activists, because the far left, the revolutionary, antagonist, social and social position, is the main material strength in the internationalist solidarity struggle with Palestine, but also the reserve that can change things inside Of this country, in the political struggle, in the real social opposition to governments and the state of capital and in particular to this government that concentrates in itself all the reasons for this opposition. "Between October and November Italy exported weapons and ammunition to Israel for a value of 817,536 euros. 233,025 in October, 584,511 in November ". In Italy there were the struggles of the ports of Genoa and other initiatives that invite to the boycott, to SO - spend the supply of weapons in Israel, the last event in Palermo had as its objective and final headquarters. The Italian network for peace and disarmament also denounces all this, indeed demonstrates how the law can be circumvented to evade the controls, to legalize post fa- estum the trade of weapons and in this case the sending of weapons to Israel . The government is an accomplice in a second row. The Italian government, the Italian war industry, are par - you of this armament of Israe- le which produced the massacres from October onwards. Cease the fire, stop the genocide! Not only that, we must be part of a war, of the war between oppressed and oppressors, between justice, freedom, self -determination of peoples - which would be sanctioned by the UN card, by the Italian Constitution, by the principles of the Church even. This is reduced to stroke paper by the Zionist state of Israel and we need to shout it strong and clear and that we use the weapons of criticism. But to stop the ferocious beast, activated by the general climate and the general world situation, the weapons of criticism must sooner or later give way to <br/><br/>  8 A long, unitary procession. This event is a point of arrival of the tenacious to overthrow the toxic narrative on Palestine and to show that even in the heart of the imperialist countries internationalism meaning to be joined to the oppressed peoples that rebel, which rebel against weapons, which internationalism It is unconditional, moral, social, political support to Palestinian resistance. Enough with the genocide, support for the Palestin resistance. These two issues were at the center of this great event. In it everyone has brought their contribution. A procession that certainly did not look at the past, but that began to think about the new future fueled by Palestine, as, to give an example, it happened in the 70s with the importance of the fool on the struggle for the liberation of Vietnam, led by the Communist Party of I have Chi Minh, supported by the Red China of Mao and by all the anti -separatory forces in the world that also constituted a wind - the wind of the East - which gradually focused on the lawn within the imperialist countries. In our intervention from the Palestinian truck we posed the problem of opposition to war, because this was also the great merit of the National event of Milan which combined solidarity with the Palestinian people and with struggles against imperialist wars, against states and Governments of the capitalist/imperialist system trying to go out with the war from the crisis in which it is and in which the world drags. The "imperialist war can only be stopped if the popular war advances", that is, the proletarian war, the war of the exploited, the war of the oppressed, from Palestine to Latin America, from India to North Africa and the Importo - Tanza of Loting against the imperialist beast at Inter - No, in the belly of the beast and in our country, against the fascist, imperialist, racist, militarist, interventionist government, alongside Israel, but also in the front row in the new military intervention in the Red Sea Against Yemen (Ribelli Huthi) solidarity with Palestine. We must give continuity to the demonstration of February 24, "We form the Palestine Committees everywhere", we form an international delegation and an internationalist confidentialist 'from the Court of Justice of the Hague to the occupied territories, which goes to Rafah to Por - Tore solidarity, support , to create further problems for the Nazi -type Zionist aggression, to the - gica del genocide, to the logic of deportation - nor of An entire people. A contingent that represents all and natively melted with the solidarity of the Palestinians, from Gaza to our cities. An internal-action contingent. We fight against our government, our imperiaism, is our task. This requires that we center the struggle to hunt the Meloni government. To overturn the government, it is necessary to content and the unit built in the Milan event will be River - yes in the factories, in the jobs, on the territory, it is leaving in the streets. We appealed to make the G7 in Puglia is a new great opportunity because the entire movement of solidarity with Palestine joins all the reasons for the political and social opposition against all the governments of the owners of the world they want also make the G7 in Puglia their base of units to build war plans even more, the oppression plans of peoples, the impeding plans of peoples, the plans for the use of artificial intelligence for the purpose of war, the plans to transform all the climatic, environmental events, the crises of the crises, the immigration, in a strenuous defense of a putrid and dying system and oppose it with the violence of the armies, bombs, the army of the proletarians e Of the oppressed peoples that in all forms, in large and small forms, opposes all this. T utti al G7 in Puglia to make evident that the world is divided into two hills: the hill of impertism, the hill of proletarians and peoples who do not accept the world that are building us and struggle to put an end to this horror without end the intervention of the companion of communist proletarians from the truck of the event</p></div>

<p>
  On March 8, the day of honor of the female struggles for emancipation and exchange rate, the ND government chose to vote on the bill to establish private universities.
  <b>
   Woman's Day this year will be a race day to not pass the Pierrakakis bill,
  </b>
  seeking to put a tombstone in the public free university, to achieve a fatal blow to the right of children of popular families to studies.
 </p>
<p>
  The establishment of private universities will bring tuition to the public university, cuts or abolition of free textbooks, free feeding and housing of students. At the same time, they seek to hit student unionism. Overall, they are planning a training for a few and fine, so they raise class barriers everywhere. A popular family has to go out if she wants to study her children or "digest" that they will simply not study.
  <b>
   On the day the symbol of the female movement must be flooded with demonstrators!
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  Students for 8 weeks, against slander, threats and open terrorism, insist on demonstrating massively and inspire their militancy and the people affected by the same anti -populist policy. A policy that destroys the life of the people, which cynically proclaims that anyone who has money can study, have health, live! The youth uprising has managed to delay the government's plans, which he thought would be "walk", the abolition of free education and at the same time, has caused serious turmoil throughout the urban bloc. Combined with the agricultural mobilizations of the previous days, he stresses that the people are deeply dissatisfied with the government policy seeking a way out.
  <b>
   The women of the people stand by the side of youth, support the occupations and demonstrations to win!
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  The government and the prime minister himself declare happy who bypassing Article 16 of the Constitution who explicitly says that higher education is public and free. With the same cynicism they overtook the civil legitimacy to conceal the crime they committed in Tempi. They were comfortably acquitted of Lignadis, stuck the case of the rape of Georgia in Thessaloniki and terrorized the 12 -year -old in Sepolia, instead of supporting it. The laws do not apply to them.
  <b>
   Urban legitimacy is used to suppress the "unruly" people who are struggling.
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  Students' struggle against private universities is a struggle to defend the popular right to studies. It is bound by the struggle for bread, work, free health, for safe cheap transportation, rights and freedoms, with the struggle against auctions and outbursts, accuracy and poverty. Working women, workers, farmers, students, the unemployed experience the attack daily, as a daily anxiety to meet the needs of the home as violence against them. They have to deal with the split hours, the miserable wages, the layoffs of pregnant women, the darkness of the church, the commission, the questioning of the right to abortion, the terror of war.
  <b>
   Students' victory will be a defeat of the government and its political system, it will be a victory for the whole people! The female movement as an integral part of the popular movement, supplies it and is powered by it. Every victory of the youth and the people contributes to the improvement of women's life conditions, is a step on the way to cross the female movement to break the double oppression of the system by overthrowing it and the dismantling of the whole ideological rust that accompanies it. .

       The communists sentence that to end the oppression of women it is essential to fight against the system that guarantees the division of classes and private property over the means of production; This does not mean that while that happens, women should not fight to achieve what they cry with fury and pain.
      </p>
<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-block: 0px 0.9rem;">
       Imperialist capitalism is undoubtedly the latest possible exploitation system; With each change and progress in the development of productive forces and the means of production, exploitative classes have been in need of increasingly requiring more work force, especially women, in all fields of knowledge, knowledge, production, and even politics.
      </p>

       The communists also recognize that, in their attempt to delay their death, imperialist capitalism intensifies the rhythm and voracity with which it exploits and oppresses the working class, which aggravates the material and social situation of all workers. Hence, the terrible evils suffered by all women in the world, especially the women of the working class and the peasantry, are the product of that salaried superexploitation.
      </p>
<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-block: 0px 0.9rem;">
       In Colombia this becomes evident every day: in the terrible working, social and life conditions to which women are subjected. Despite what the defenders and reformers of the bourgeois state say, in capitalism the woman is simply seen as cheap labor, easy to buy and superexpletar because the conditions of existence force her to undergo worse conditions.
      </p>
<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-block: 0px 0.9rem;">
       Female unemployment rates (15.9% in January 2024) talk about the large number of women in need of a job, which causes that both factories, companies, state institutions, even in the streets, thousands of Women are willing to undergo strenuous days and low wages.
      </p>
<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-block: 0px 0.9rem;">
       And what to say the peasant women, subject to work from sun to Sol most of the time without salary in the small plots, or receiving worse salaries than those of the day laborers or proletarians in the great agribusiness production.
      </p>
<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-block: 0px 0.9rem;">
       The exploiters impose on women conditions that make their lives a hell: low salaries, exhausting days, sexual harassment in jobs, ill -treatment ... in the field also, subject to the war against the people that strips them, displaces them , they forced them, viola or kill them ... to which the thousands of unpaid hours of work are added in their homes, many sacrifices to cover the minimum of subsistence of them and their children. Of all this suffering, capital benefits, since domestic work is a fundamental part of capitalist exploitation, it serves to reproduce the labor force that capitalist parasites will be responsible for devouring in the future.
      </p>
<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-block: 0px 0.9rem;">
       At these levels of exploitation over the women of the people, the terrible forms of violence to which they are exposed: sexual abuse, violations, physical violence, disappearances and femicides are added; Products of social decomposition, of spiritual and physical degradation in which the entire system has been sinking making the most reactionary and retrograde manifestations resurface against women.
      </p>
<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-block: 0px 0.9rem;">
       This dying system, which deprives the women and men of the working people of their slightest rights, denies them living conditions for their personal fulfillment, time and resources for their education, their culture and rest; hinder the economic and social conditions that guarantee their physical and mental health. All these reasons make the capitalist system just be destroyed by those who suffer from their ills.
      </p>
<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-block: 0px 0.9rem;">
       Therefore, all rage must be pointed against the exploiting classes that bleed women and men under the yoke of salaried slavery, and against their bourgeois state that guarantees the subsistence of imperialist capitalism.
      </p>
<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-block: 0px 0.9rem;">
       That the fair rage of women becomes a direct and forceful blow against those above, an accurate blow that allows improving the living conditions of all women and advancing to the conquest of the power of workers and peasants to end to wage exploitation.
      </p>
<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-block: 0px 0.9rem;">
       To advise that blow, it is necessary to form a revolutionary female movement that channels all the female force, not only to resist and face daily oppression and violence, but to direct it together against the entire bourgeois state and the exploitation system that Drowns the women and men of the working class and the peasantry.
      </p>
<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-block: 0px 0.9rem;">
       A revolutionary female movement capable of joining on a single platform the main claims of women to conquer them with direct struggle. A revolutionary female movement that mobilizes women in the countryside and the city to force the fight in the streets, blockade, unemployment and strike that the State, representative of the exploiters, meets the demands of women.
      </p>
<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-block: 0px 0.9rem;">
       It is essential to organize a revolutionary female movement that permanently mobilizes the women of the town, who is able to go outside in large blocks to face all manifestations of capitalist exploitation and social decomposition with which they are violated. Women should organize to fight the root of all the evils that overwhelm them.
      </p>
<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-block: 0px 0.9rem;">
       In the case of proletarian women, it is necessary that they organize even more strongly, because the fight against capitalist exploitation suffered by women is inseparable from the common struggle of all exploited and oppressed against all the power of the capitalists. That the great revolutionary blocks of women are present in all days of struggle and demonstrations of the working class, to lift the women's platform against the superexploitation and oppression system that, as well as the rest of the workers, submits them to everything Type of vexars and humiliations.
      </p>
<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-block: 0px 0.9rem;">
       We call all working women in the countryside and the city, the students, the unemployed young women to become revolutionary, conscious fighters ... to put themselves at the forefront of this task against all the conditions that reduce and violate politically, economically and ideologically to women . To build the revolutionary committees of women who shape the revolutionary female movement.

   "Cancel Culture" is a much discussed concept that deals with the individual or collectives which acts or statements who do that in any way are chauvinist and are often excluded from connections. This word is primarily used by rights and reactionaries to complain about a supposedly dominant and hegemonic "left -wing Cancel Culture" because, for example, "nothing can be said anymore today". How successful the supposedly "left Cancel Culture" looks in reality can be seen that patriarchal criminals like Till Lindemann and Luke Mockridge can continue to fill the republic's event halls without - apart from some very good protests - consequences.
  </span>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<span>
   When it comes to "Cancel Culture" and the exclamation that you can't say anything more, there is also a real core. Because we have been experiencing reinforced attacks on our democratic rights since Corona pandemic and in particular also on freedom of expression.

<a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationale_Filmfestspiele_Berlin_2024#Antisemitismusvorw%C3%BCrfe_nach_der_Preisverleihung">
    A concrete example of this mouth-dead maker by the rulers is the debate about the so-called Berlinale incident.
   </a>
   On February 24th, at the award ceremony of the Berlinale, critical and advanced jury members and artists with some Palestinian and Jewish background at the award ceremony with signs and statements for an end to the Zionist genocide against the Palestinians and an end to the apartheid laws by Israel required. In addition, German participation in the genocide in Gaza was denounced and, in addition to an armistice, a stop of all arms delivery from Germany to Israel was required. Thereupon, in the German political and media landscape, which is equal to Palestine, broke out a disgusting and spiritual electricity to chauvinism and agitation against the progressive participants of the Berlinale.

   Afterwards, Berlin's ruling CDU mayor Wegner and the Green Cultural Commission of the Federal Government Claudia Roth were publicly criticized for alleged applause.
   <a href="https://www.rbb24.de/kultur/berlinale/beitraege/2024/berlinale-umstrittene-aeusserungen-nahostkonflkt-israel-kritik-wegner.html">
    Kai Wegner later wrote on social networks
   </a>
<em>
    “Berlin has a clear attitude when it comes to defending freedom. This also means that Berlin is firmly on the side of Israel. There is no doubt about that. The Hamas lies full responsibility for the deep suffering in Israel and the Gaza Strip. She has it in her hand to end this suffering by exposing all hostages and lying down the weapons. There is no room for relativizations here. I expect measures of the new Berlinale festival management here "
   </em>
   and
   <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/27/german-minister-says-she-was-only-applauding-israeli-filmmaker-at-berlinale">
    Claudia Roth did not miss the fact that her clapping only fought the Jews and Israelis.
   </a>
   According to these statements, the volumes for the understanding of freedom and anti-Semitism of government politicians are now speaking a debate about how to restrict freedom of expression in the cultural company.

<a href="https://www1.wdr.de/nachrichten/landespolitik/antisemitismus-kultur-100.html">
    NRW Land Minister of Culture Ina Brandes answers the WDR
   </a>
<em>
    "It must be ensured" that public funds are not abused to obviously finance anti -Semitic, racist and/or group -specific misanthropic projects, art and culture "
   </em>
   And Claudia Roth calls for a code of conduct for cultural institutions to establish. In the meantime, the WDR is able to associate tightened security measures for a conversation events between the hated Federal Minister of Economics Habeck and the Zionist lobbyist Michel Friedman with an increased anti -Semitic attack potential. Behind alleged or real threat potential would probably be the broad anti -imperialist anger and rejection against such figures. And the past is also not certain in front of the WDR that rated the agitation against the Ruhrtriennale Festival and its then director for supporting the BDS movement. Which is well shown that there is now a tradition in NRW under the guise of anti -Semitism fight against advanced and anti -imperialist artists.
  </span>
</br></br></br></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<span>
<a href="https://www.sueddeutsche.de/medien/blog-ruhrbarone-israel-palaestina-krieg-antisemitismus-1.6385617?reduced=true">
    An example of this is an article recently published in the Süddeutsche Zeitung about the machinations of the right and Zionist blog "Ruhrbarone"
   </a>
   Its team of authors is well networked in the bourgeois policy from FDP to the wing of the right and regularly drives rigid campaigns against everything that is not unconditionally behind the Israeli peoples. This is shown by the example of Sharon Dodua Otoo, a publicist with Ghanaian roots, which was supposed to receive the Peter Weiß Prize of the city of Bochum and this was denied due to a ruin of the Ruhrbarons, which she connected with an allegedly anti-Semitic petition. When afterwards a cultural scientist interior, the otoo did not sign the petition in question, the Bochum city peaks did not revise their decision. The otoo in general was enough to support the Palestinians.
  </span>
<br/>
<br/>
<span>
   And these examples show how very real the ruling class tries to banish progressive and revolutionary positions from the public. People are unloaded, financing are withdrawn and publicly pilloried. The pattern has been the same since Corona. Advanced positions such as the solidarity with the struggle of the people of Palestine are represented as reactionary and chauvinistic and the fight against advanced positions such as the Palestine solidarity are progressive. The spokesman for the NRW Ministry of Culture says this line
   <em>
    "For project funding, workshops and advanced training for selection juries should be introduced in order to sensitize to anti -Semitism, racism and group -specific discrimination."
   </em>
   Translated, this means that the bourgeois state and its protagonists will look very closely in the future so that progressive positions will not be promoted. An apprenticeship that can be drawn from it is not even dependent on the state in order to preserve its political independence.

  On the morning of Thursday 7/3 the 57 -year -old disabled Fighter Professor G.N. Siebaba came out of the central gate of the Nagbur prison, after ten years in which he suffered a prosecution and imprisonment in particularly harsh conditions under the responsibility of the reactionary Indian regime. On Tuesday 5/3, a 293 -page ruling was made by the Nagbourg section of the Mumbai Supreme Court, with which he acquitted him of the charges he was sentenced to life imprisonment. He ruled that the evidence that had associated him with the illegal Kkindia (Maoist) and were built by the police authorities, were unfounded and even violated these so -called anti -terrorist laws and that the decision of the Primary Court in 2017 was unsubstantiated. It was then March when the local court in Gadchiroli had sentenced him and four others - Prashant Rahi, Mahesh Tikri, Hem Keshwdatta Mishra and Pandu Narote - in life imprisonment. The sixth defendant, Vijay Nan Tikri, was sentenced to 10 years of strict imprisonment.

 The acquittal of Siebaba and his five co -defendant comrades is the second in a row, after October 2022 with the same up -and -down. And then, as now, the reactionary government of the Maharastra State in cooperation with the federal in New Delhi has appealed against it, but this time, at least for the time being, it was not requested to continue his sentence. The authorities, of course, even at the last minute tried to delay liberation by putting bureaucratic obstacles. In his first statements during a press conference, Saybaba said that he was coming out alive from Katergos as his health over the years has worsened significantly from the excruciating conditions in the cell. He pointed out that one of his five co -defendants, 33 -year -old Pandu Narote died in prison on August 25, 2022, saying: "A young man who belonged to a primordial race had to wither in prison with us. Had a little daughter. He suffered so much. Is this justice? " He thanked those who supported him and spoke especially about his lawyers' struggles in the case of Surendra Gadling who has been imprisoned under the anti -terrorist law: "A lawyer who fought for justice, who has represented hundreds and thousands Court of Justice, such a man is in prison. If justice must be fully attributed to my case, then Gadling should be released. " Gandling became the target of the Indian authorities, among other things and why he was a legal defender of Siebaba.
 <br>
<br>
 The second acquittal is a loud slap for the reactionary forces in India. The decision and liberation of Siebaba and the rest of the fighters who are out of prison with a high prison was welcomed by a number of organizations and movements in the country and internationally and is a victory for the great solidarity movement for political prisoners in India. It reinforces its potential to get out of the cells and other political prisoners who condemned the Indian regime for their ideas and struggles for a society without injustices and inequalities.

  A few hours before the passage of the bill on private universities, while discussions are being discussed in the House and the student associations are organizing the Pan -Hellenic demonstration in Athens, the KNE and the PCS forces show once again the zero confidence they have in masses. Instead of discussing how each club will arrive in Athens, to take place in the occupation committees and the assemblies, thus ensuring the further involvement of the student world in this process, the PCF forces (always with the signature of student clubs) They took a posters with their members of each city so that every student can communicate and "close a seat" on the bus ... As if the students are stupid and they have to contact the PCS to go down to the demonstration ...
 </p>
<p>
  Property rationales for the movement that characterizes KNE forces cannot allow her not to deal with who will "close the buses". No matter how much the bus seats are elected to the Bus, their stop will be expected the next day. After all, the direction they will take after March 8 is clear. The law is to stay on paper with multifaceted actions and without assembly occupations demonstrations. Already, while the youth is giving the struggle of its generation, KNE (and not only) "closes" ballots for the student elections and is preparing for the European elections ...
 </p>
<p>
  These ownership rationales do not in any way help the student movement. And they don't just concern KNE. Property rationales lead to the degenerative phenomena and organizational confrontations we saw in the nationwide of February 8th. The logic of assigning and unlawful student world from the actions of his club are a hindrance to the development of the student movement and the continuation of the grand struggle it gives.
 </p>
<p>
  Against these rationales but also against disorienting and impassable demands (not to apply the law, to stay on paper, etc.) that have done a great deal of damage to the student movement in previous years we are clearly responding. With collective and organized races we can win!

<p>
  Last Thursday, the Athens Medical Students' Association and the Law Association of DUTH to the Committee on Education in Parliament were invited to "discuss" the objections of the student associations on the bill.
 </p>
<p>
  The Law Association was represented via Webex a member of the DAP and the Medical Association by the Vice President of the Student Association (KNE) and a member of the ESAK.
 </p>
<p>
  We have a lot to observe for both the presence and placements of these.
 </p>
<p>
  For the first time, the DAP is normal and expected to appear in these procedures. As a government faction, bourgeois institutions and parliaments are its natural space. He agrees with the bill, acts as another repressive mechanism against student claims and will obviously come out to defend private universities and the House of Representatives.
 </p>
<p>
  On the other hand, what work do those who are supposed to be with student struggles in the Education Committee's benches? Who told them that they could drag the student associations in the name of the carriage on conciliation paths with those who bring and implement the attack on our rights? And the arguments of the type "transferred the demands of the student movement" or "we could not and should not only be left to the DAP to speak on behalf of the student associations" are not convinced of anyone. The government has been happy to know the demands of the student movement for two months. They have been clearly done by our assemblies, occupations and demonstrations. The role of the student movement is not to convey demands and decisions to rectors, adolescents and the House even worse. Is to claim rights. And these were never won by reconciliation with systemic representatives. But with struggles.
 </p>
<p>
  This is one of the many cases that reveal how these forces see student clubs. Student associations were and must remain struggles in the hands of the students. They were operating and must operate independently of the state and its mechanisms. This is how they were formed, so they put people in the race here for years. With these characteristics they managed to achieve the victories of the student movement, to conquer rights.
 </p>
<p>
  The KNE and the EAKs seem to want to deal with them in other terms. They want to turn them into interlocutors with the expressors of the attack, sowing illusions about the institutions, eventually directing the rage and moods of students' struggle on impassable and harmless roads.
 </p>
<p>
  In fact, the only way the student movement to be able to win is the collective processes of the student associations, the general assemblies, are the mass occupations and demonstrations of the students. Understanding collective processes, unmo in student masses and power, conciliation with the system and its expressors, has nothing to give the student movement. On the contrary, it can only be disoriented and disoriented.

<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Once so much we agree with Meloni. Yesterday the lady has 
 met the police unions and the whole plethora of associations 
 of the police, carabinieri, Guardia di Finanza. And has 
 substantially declared: “There is a climate that I don't like and that 
 It reminds me of very difficult years for our nation ".
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Clearly 
 This is what we share. This climate doesn't even like it to 
 we and I believe I don't like to feed students in Pisa, ai 
 demonstrators under the Rai headquarters in Turin, of Naples, do not like it to 
 all those who in the last six months of this government have suffered 
 police offices and more, to all those who have suffered 
 harassment, persecutions, prohibitions, to all those who are 
 measuring from the birth of this government on a chain of 
 measures on public order and on the safety that attack 
 basically the freedom to demonstrate, the freedom of protest, 
 freedom of association and are continuously found at risk 
 aggression, repression, complaints, processes, by this 
 government and of this state, whose ministers, undersecretaries, demand 
 impunity, they make victims even when it comes to obvious 
 violations of laws and constitution, even when it comes to 
 Open phenomena of corruption and conflict of interest. And the list 
 Here he should concern several.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Instead it is the government that makes the 
 victim, it is the government that takes the field to defend police and 
 repressive forces also in the face of clearly reported situations 
 also by the entire press and even reported by the President of the 
 Republic. Instead of finding carabinieri, law enforcement officers, cops on the defendants' bench 
 violent, the manifested are put on that counter.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But this government is 
 prepare to force the repressive apparatus to make even more 
 Police will, brutality even as possible 
 detective, the repression of events, even when yes 
 deals with young and very young people who rightly make the 
 their voices that in recent times is heard around the 
 solidarity with the Palestinian people.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Essentially 
 This government provocatively raises tones and shooting and prepares 
 new narrow both in legislative terms and in terms of 
 law enforcement behaviors.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  And rightly 
 Look at the G7.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  It is clear that 
 This government is preparing for a repression of the G8 genre of 
 Genoa, of torture, of the detective positions, of the prisoners 
 arbitrary, of all the horror that constituted the G8 of Genoa and 
 prepare for a replay, this time in advance, to prevent there 
 may be the manifestations that are more necessary than ever in 
 occasion of this appointment, events that will have to 
 collect students, proletarians and all the reasons for the protest does not 
 Only against this government but against the masters of the world they have us 
 downloaded the crisis on our skin and which today prepare the war, 
 In addition to being responsible for environmental, climatic disaster, 
 In addition to being responsible for the huge massacre of migrants in 
 Mari, particularly in the Mediterranean.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Instead this 
 Government thinks about the application of a Daspo for demonstrators 
 violent, the demonstrators who rightly protest against this 
 war, against the increases in military expenditure, against this 
 repression, against this inhuman treatment of immigrants, who 
 protest against the school reform, against the attack on 
 workers rights. All these protests are assimilated to 
 ultras and anti-ultras legislation that has established the daspo 
 Now it could be extended to violent demonstrators, that is to say 
 prevent those who are reported by the police, also to participate in the 
 event. That is, a real police state, a 
 behavior of the fascist regime at the time of Mussolini, of 
 to which this government that wants it or not is direct descendant, and it 
 Remember even in forms that we call modern.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Instead of 
 Put name and surname to the policemen so that it is easier, 
 In case of episodes such as Pisa, to identify also the 
 individual responsibilities - because in this there are also 
 individual liability, because a significant part of the 
 policemen are fascists, vile cops who use the uniform for the 
 PREVERIFICATION AND VIOLENCE - Instead of going in this direction the government assigns him the Body Cam to identify protests, all kinds 
 of protest towards them, also the slogans, even the invectives 
 more than reasonable, which consequently allows the demonstrators of 
 be stopped and persecuted even after the events.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  And just as Meloni is 
 demonstrated available to the use of drones to check 
 from above the processions - which are already super controlled by 
 helicopters, super controlled by the system of cameras that does yes 
 that each event is transformed into a reason to hit 
 Active demonstrators - drones want to consider them as if we were 
 In a war, drones have been used and are used 
 In wars, from India to Palestine, to Ukraine, to subsidia 
 War operations.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  And what the 
 Government wants to do is a war on the demonstrators and to 
 events.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  For the meeting with 
 The police unions would have to open a stadium because 
 The associations that represent the policemen, their unions are 
 always in the front row, such as forklifts and defenders of themselves, of 
 facing the most horrible ugliness we will talk about in the course of 
 This contrainformation.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The unions of the 
 police should be dissolved. Are associations that defend i 
 policemen in their most brutal behaviors, the most illegal and of 
 consequence constitute a state in the state and contribute to 
 make the police and the police of the squadristi in uniform 
 rather than what their ordinary function should be.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  You think you do it 
 quickly and this is clear that they want to do it quickly, 
 precisely because Meloni indicates in the preventive activity e 
 repressive compared to the G7 the urgency of these measures and consequently 
 We want to intervene directly in the parliamentary discussion - 
 that is already there with the plethora of the decrees on the safety of each 
 Order and degree already in Parliament - to insert these measures 
 repressive.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Then when 
 We report the police state, modern fascism, war 
 external as a general container of the internal one that becomes 
 War outside - Imperialist military interventions, like the last 
 approved by the Parliament in Red Sea, but which follows the 
 presence of Italian imperialist troops in other scenarios, 
 Including the enlarged one of Ukraine - which corresponds to internal war. It is a law of nature 
 imperialism and is a law of nature of imperialism 
 Italian, of its coalition and its main references in 
 This moment, US imperialism.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  It is clear that it is 
 a step forward towards the police state and the fascism model and is 
 clear that in these cases it is necessary to defend the 
 Rights and democratic freedoms, the freedoms to demonstrate. 
 This necessarily requires for the system of laws that comes 
 made a permanent violation of these laws. If we were to 
 Attentive to these laws we should no longer manifest but remain a 
 house or even transform us into self -adventure on house arrest, seen 
 the regulations that must be submitted.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Everything is fine 
 demonstration for this government must be transformed into a problem 
 of public order to feed the "Law and Order" campaign, use it 
 both for electoral purposes and to cover the true nature of this 
 government, a government of the owners, the government of war, the government 
 of repression.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The first rumors that 
 They got up in the room are critical: the AVS warns 
 (Left green alliance) that rights cannot be prohibited 
 constitutional on the freedom to demonstrate through an act 
 administrative like the daspo.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Clearly 
 We share this judgment. But we really think that limiting yourself to 
 Can this type of judgment constitute the opposition?
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Meloni and Salvini 
 They play those who are more gallows, the ministers from these gentlemen 
 placed in defense of public order, to police heads. The 
 widespread and widespread system of the police is such as to be 
 a armor to the government action.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This is therefore 
 A qualitative leap. Of course, we always talk about "quality jumps", 
 We also got tired of talking about quality jumps. Everything is fine 
 passage of this kind, every moment of social conflict, of 
 unmasking of the function of repression is used by 
 government to feed it further and in this sense that towards 
 which the government is marked is within the internal war, to one 
 militarization of political social conflict in this country.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Against this 
 militarization of the social and political conflict must be built 
 the tools to defend democratic freedoms and considering 
 that this defense today almost always passes from defending the reasons for 
 these manifestations with forms of organization that allows it to 
 continuity, development and their effectiveness.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Of course, we are 
 all under attack on this, even if the government's eye is towards 
 the most radical events that cross these country, therefore in recent times, in 
 Particularly the manifestations of solidarity with Palestine. It is clear that the government's eye is to hit these to hit everyone, 
 touch one to touch everyone and if we tie it to the attacks 
 To the right of strike, the repression against workers can 
 understand the nature not only of the action of the 
 government, but also of the necessary response.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  You need the front 
 united against repression. But an active process is also needed among the 
 political and social education workers because of this 
 political and social education is the formation of a real 
 avant -garde of the working class, which is also a avant -garde 
 Politics not only of the class but of all movements.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  And in this sense 
 It is up to the communists like us, to the avant -garde of the 
 Basic class unionism, be in the front row in the complaint 
 Among the files of the workers of the government repressive measures, 
 of the government's attacks on events - see the last attack 
 to the students of Pisa - and push workers to take a position, a 
 enter the field and to defend not only the occasions in which the 
 workers and workers are made signs of repressive and of 
 even political measures, in factories, in places 
 of work, to be sensitive to any oppression, to all forms 
 of oppression that this government, this state at the service of 
 Masters, make against those who oppose and manifest in this country.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  That there are no 
 misunderstandings to this is explained well by the Verona process, in which 5 
 policemen are under accusation for torture, 5 policemen are accused 
 to have participated in various capacities between July 22 and March 23, 
 therefore for a long period, in the middle of the new government 
 Meloni, to torture, beatings, humiliations towards people stopped or arrested, especially immigrants, drug addicts, 
 homeless. Among the accusations also false, omissions of office deeds, 
 Peculed, abuse of office, aggravated by racial hatred.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  A process to gods 
 criminals in uniform that touched everything. In the judgment decree 
 immediate arranged by the investigating judge of Verona, we read among the disputed crimes 
 to have "tortured with sadistic enjoyment", within the 
 Verona Police Headquarters, people stopped for identification or for the 
 possession of small quantities of hashish.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Not only that, but 
 These policemen have issued complaints, falsified minutes, abused 
 of their powers, have inflicted kicks and slaps to a Romanian citizen stopped for 
 identification until they lose their senses, with use 
 unjustified spray, with humiliation, like the one that forces him 
 to urinate in the room where he was detained and then clean it with one 
 tore up.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Of criminals, 
 of the beasts in uniform. And they are not isolated cases. It is useless to remember 
 The Cucchi case.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  It is all 
 days that things of this happen in the police headquarters 
 gender and take place with the coverage of the commands, of the police headquarters. AND 
 When they are caught we also scandalize the 
 Manifesto: “The Minister of the Interior, the police unions not 
 They are constituted by a civil party ".
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  It is clear that 
 In these cases, it does not constitute a civil party means covering them, 
 it means considering them part of themselves and therefore it is clear that the 
 responsibility for what happens goes well beyond the beasts in uniform e 
 It affects the system: the Ministry of the Interior, the unions of 
 police, the self -defense of the state and separated bodies, because they 
 I am the concentrate of the true nature of the bourgeois state.

  On Tuesday, February 13, a march of tens of thousands of peasants in India began, especially from Punjab and Haryana, towards the capital of the country, New Delhi. They loaded trucks and all kinds of vehicles with food and equipment, prepared to travel for a long time and camp in the city if necessary. All this comes after failed negotiations with the state authorities, which are evident who have fooled the peasants after having made numerous promises in the past. Since Tuesday the police have been shooting tear gas, fortifying the capital and fiercely attacking peasants to prevent them from reaching their destination. Internet services have also been cut in many places in Haryana and meetings of a certain size in the capital have been prohibited. Although most peasants are Punjab and Haryana, groups have also been added from Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh.
 </p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-d183d76801840891e545b1b4979052ab">
  Indian peasants and the current Indian government have already collided. Between 2020 and 2021 there were huge protests and after them Modi and the BJP had to withdraw a series of measures that liberalized the agricultural market. Additionally, they promised the peasants that a series of measures would be taken, the most outstanding of them, ensure the price of the products of the peasants to avoid losses. Some time ago, the Indian government had already promised to fold the income of the peasants by 2022, which was not fulfilled again. Additionally, in 2022 the Indian government promised the peasants that they would stabilize a series of guaranteed prices to maintain the subsistence of the Maltregresos Indian.
 </p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-2772c22ac842cb3d3cce88bba38fd495">
  All this has served as a crop broth so that Indian peasants rebel against the old Indian state. Finally, after years of waiting and of being abandoned, Indian peasants demand that guarantees, either through prices set by law or with more state support, including that the government guarantees state reserves of food, buying products at the minimum prices stipulated with farmers. Another requirement that they have is that they are exempt from paying agricultural loans and that income exceeds more than 50 percent of production costs. The most active peasants have been those of Haryana and Punjab because the main beneficiaries of the minimum prices stipulated in recent years have been them, since they sell most of their grain under this price system.
 </p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-8415050bbeb69efe80c06e86165d2bc6">
  The BJP government and the Indian ruling classes have repeatedly demonstrated that they do not watch over the interests of the peasants, but serve the interests of imperialism, mainly Yankee. Not only did they breach the promises made after the strong protests of 2020-2021, but recently the living conditions of the peasants have worsened for the new sales agreement of the country to the imperialists. One more measure that was detrimental to the conditions of the peasants, was months ago after the G20, when there was an agreement between Yankee imperialism and the Indian ruling classes: India lowered taxes on many very important agricultural products for the economy of the economy of the Yankee imperialism, giving rise to its mass import to the detriment of the production of local peasants. We already report this agreement and the terrible consequences of the BJP policy for the Indian peasantry:
  <em>
   “In general, all these food products have the characteristic that they are products
  </em>
  Very consumed in the Asian country
  <em>
   , and therefore very profitable for the United States its export. However, for this same reason, they are a necessary base for the producers of India, since some of them are an important economic source for entire regions such as apples, nuts and almonds in the states of Jammu and Cashmira, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh. In these states in the economy tourism is being imposed as the main business, leaving thousands of poor peasants ruined. ”
  </em>
</p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-f923af23b2bb54906eb02b9a1d1ecbbd">
  Given these protests and the huge mobilizations of peasants who march to Delhi, the old Indian state has carried out several actions: he has armored New Delhi and cut all the accesses for the peasants. He has shielded the borders of the city as if they were borders from one state to another and how they were at war, but against their own people. On the other hand, it has unleashed a brutal wave of repression, with unpublished actions so far as bombarding with tear gas from drones to protesters. In addition, there have been strong clashes with the riot police, in which the peasants have remained firm and combative, and have even managed methods to counteract the much superior media of the repressive forces. For example, it is reported that they are throwing stones to tear down drones, they are using tractors to remove cement barricades, and that they use defensive methods of various types to minimize the effects of tear gas. The old Indian state only knows a way to deal with the protests of the peasants: the brutal repression. In the protests that were from 2020 to 2021 there were more than 750 dead Indian peasants.

  Again we see how the situation in southern Asia is especially turbulent, and how we mentioned earlier, the explosiveness of the masses is increasing. Bureaucratic capitalism is in a critical situation and the bureaucratic-terrarate governments, the imperialists and the local ruling classes are not able to stop or tame the people when it rebels fairly against the misery to which imperialism and capitalism relegate it bureaucratic.

  On Wednesday, February 21, the peasant Shubh Karam Singh, who was demonstrating with thousands of peasants was shot dead by the Indian Police in the Jind district, Haryana. We already report it previously. No agent has not been responsible for it, and Punjab Prime Minister Bhagwant Mann tried to buy the family and the peasantry announcing that he would grant them compensation of 10 million rupees, equivalent to $ 120,000. In turn, the Indian police declared that the cause of death would only be known after autopsy, clearing any possible guilt on them.
 </p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-40d6fed01d64c3e98344409021e97ba5">
  The murder of Shubh Karam Singh does not represent an isolated case, but the repression of the old Indian state is being very hard since the beginning of the protests. The use of tear gas, cement barricades protecting the capital of the country, and strong police charges has been the norm during this week of peasant protests. In addition to this, the old Indian state has also put into operation all its propaganda and censorship machinery. The peasantry of the Punjab region is being accused of being infiltrated or having links with the "terrorism" of Kalistan independence organizations, declared as terrorists by the old Indian state. In this way the fair struggle of the people is criminalized and the hard repression against him is justified. In previous peasant protests such as those of the year 2021, there were already accusations of it by the State Prosecutor.
 </p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-3fb67c18dbdd9c5efceacb2c08b86ed9">
  On the other hand, the old Indian state has made other types of repressive measures, aimed at isolating the peasant struggle and that is not known or can denounce the crimes and repression they are facing. For example, Internet accesses and sending messages have been cut in numerous Haryana districts from February 11 until last Saturday. It has even been known that the Indian authorities have contacted the social network “X” (previously Twitter) to close and delete publications related to the peasant struggle. This has been admitted by the social network itself.
 </p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-2845bae93e4f72265da3607c27bdc7c5">
  The murder of the young peasant and the hard repression of the old Indian state did not placate the protests of the Indian peasantry, but the latter has redoubled its efforts in the mobilizations, has summoned new. On Friday 24 the Indian peasant declared a "Black Day" and raised thousands of black flags during the marches and collided again with the repressive forces of the old Indian state, during his march towards the capital, New Delhi. The peasant organizations made numerous protests against police repression, burning effigies of Modi, Amit Shah and the Prime Minister of Haryana and there have been new injuries due to police brutality. They also announced new mobilizations, including a tractor on Monday, February 26.

<p>
  The establishment of private universities will bring tuition to the public university, cuts or abolition of free textbooks, free feeding and housing of students. At the same time, they seek to hit student unionism. Overall, they are planning a training for a few and fine, so they raise class barriers everywhere. A popular family has to go out if she wants to study her children or "digest" that they will simply not study.
  <strong>
   On the day the symbol of the female movement must be flooded with demonstrators!
  </strong>
</p>

  Students for 8 weeks, against slander, threats and open terrorism, insist on demonstrating massively and inspire their militancy and the people affected by the same anti -populist policy. A policy that destroys the life of the people, which cynically proclaims that anyone who has money can study, have health, live! The youth uprising has managed to delay the government's plans, which he thought would be "walk", the abolition of free education and at the same time, has caused serious turmoil throughout the urban bloc. Combined with the agricultural mobilizations of the previous days, he stresses that the people are deeply dissatisfied with the government policy seeking a way out.
  <strong>
   The women of the people stand by the side of youth, support the occupations and demonstrations to win!
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  The government and the prime minister himself declare happy who bypassing Article 16 of the Constitution who explicitly says that higher education is public and free. With the same cynicism they overtook the civil legitimacy to conceal the crime they committed in Tempi. They were comfortably acquitted of Lignadis, stuck the case of the rape of Georgia in Thessaloniki and terrorized the 12 -year -old in Sepolia, instead of supporting it. The laws do not apply to them.
  <strong>
   Urban legitimacy is used to suppress the "unruly" people who are struggling.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  Students' struggle against private universities is a struggle to defend the popular right to studies. It is bound by the struggle for bread, work, free health, for safe cheap transportation, rights and freedoms, with the struggle against auctions and outbursts, accuracy and poverty. Working women, workers, farmers, students, the unemployed experience the attack daily, as a daily anxiety to meet the needs of the home as violence against them. They have to deal with the split hours, the miserable wages, the layoffs of pregnant women, the darkness of the church, the commission, the questioning of the right to abortion, the terror of war.
  <strong>
   Students' victory will be a defeat of the government and its political system, it will be a victory for the whole people! The female movement as an integral part of the popular movement, supplies it and is powered by it. Every victory of the youth and the people contributes to the improvement of women's life conditions, is a step on the way to cross the female movement to break the double oppression of the system by overthrowing it and the dismantling of the whole ideological rust that accompanies it. .
  </strong>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<strong>
   Victory in the Student Struggle!
  </strong>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<strong>
   On Friday, March 8/all on the streets!

  Since the end of 2023 a wave of protests began to be gestated that has spread and strengthened throughout Europe. Some of the first demonstrations occurred at the end of last year, when farmers from several border countries with Ukraine, blocked roads to prevent the entry of Ukrainian cereals.
 </p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-0ba75d6bc5336777eab1642128d68111">
  Then, in the first week of December, in Cahors, France, hundreds of farmers threw tons of manure and hay in government buildings, demanding better conditions and regulation to sell their products, as they claim that they are working at a loss, due to the increase in the Production costs and to the entry of agricultural products from other countries at a lower price.

  on several roads in the country and along the border with Ukraine. They also protest the importation of Ukrainian grains, which are entering the European Union (EU) without tariffs and are causing the bankruptcy of local producers. The state's response was promises and repression: several arrested protesters and suspended driving licenses for some truck drivers who participated.

   Thousands of French farmers took their tractors and headed towards the capital Paris
  </a>
  , with the aim of sitting it by blocking several highways. The state's response was to deploy thousands of police officers to prevent the arrival of farmers to the capital. The main reasons indicated by the French peasants to mobilize, are the high cost of agricultural diesel, delays in subsidy payments and the unbearable competition against imports of foreign agricultural products.

  On February 1, strong protests were recorded in Brussels, Belgium, when the peasants took the streets surrounding the European Parliament, completely collapsing mobility in this important sector, known as the EU heart. Confrontations were presented between the protesters and the police, bonfires were set, the farmers launched eggs to Parliament, in addition to feeling the speakers of their tractors and gunpowder.

   Spanish farmers carried out strong protests
  </a>
  , with which dozens of roads have blocked throughout the country. They demand decreased bureaucratic procedures and changes in common agricultural policy (PAC), fair prices for their products, aid against drought and suspension of imports from some products from other countries, since they point out that competition is unfair, already that these foreign products are not required the same as European products. One of the most important actions of protesters was the blockade of the Mercadona Logistics Center in the city of Antequera, where farmers demanded fair prices for their products. Mercadona is one of the main supermarket chains in Spain, an action that was repressed by the riots, who threw tear gas and rubber bullets.

  The protests have continued and extended, those mentioned above are just a sample of the strong wave of mobilizations that are lived in Europe, many more have occurred throughout the continent. Blocks and protests have been recorded in several cities and roads in Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, France, Spain, Romania, Poland, Italy, Greece, Portugal, among others. Some of them with clashes between protesters and the repressive forces of the State.
 </p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-b5da8cb498489b9ac6b8b207b3b64440">
  Next, some of the causes or reasons that have led the farmers to take the de facto roads and take to the streets to block and protest.
 </p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-e8be91f2cca71c6e72893dbc00aedf4b">
  1- The increase in production costs due to the increase in several necessary supplies in agricultural production. For example, fuel prices due to Russia's invasion war against Ukraine, to which the fact that some governments such as Germany and France are added to eliminate taxes, or tax exemptions, which farmers receive Agricultural diesel, which aggravates the problem. Also fertilizers and electricity have substantially increased their prices.
 </p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-69dc792288247bd0ce0d0d1b4b04ded8">
  2- Imposition of environmental measures to farmers. The European Parliament, through the European Green Pact, and reforms to the Common Agrarian Policy (PAC), seeks to impose environmental measures, taxes and restrictions on agricultural production. Some of the measures that have been mentioned most are forcing farmers to dedicate 4% of their land to non -productive activities, reduce the use of fertilizers by 20% and make crop rotation. Measures with which, according to protesters, production costs are increased. In addition, farmers denounce that, while they are imposed greater environmental measures and controls, imported products, from other countries, are not required, therefore, competition is totally unequal.
 </p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-2df44001bd229cc59a7a6f8f6fb7af27">
  3- Due to the War of Invasion in Ukraine, the European Union lifted the restrictions on imports from that country. In particular, cereal entry has in serious problems to European farmers, since Ukraine is one of the main grain -producing countries in the world, and the entrance without tariffs of their products, to other European countries, causes a fall of the prices and impossibility for local farmers to compete, working at a loss.
 </p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-2af27eec96c2767d1e3a8ae44c21423b">
  4- The role of intermediaries. While the peasants are receiving low prices for their products, many of these products have increased their prices in supermarkets, where they are acquired by the final consumer, however, that price increase is being left by intermediaries, which are mainly the Financial capital and large distribution chains and supermarkets, in the hands of large monopolies.
 </p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-53099b60b7f065feab555d72a3799a33">
  There are more fighting reasons, but these are some of the most mentioned in different media that have covered the protests.
 </p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-ea1be0a735db59be7477edb0ad1036cd">
  The European people have shown great expressions of struggle in recent years, just remember the struggle of the French yellow vests that shuddered the entire country, and that aroused solidarity in many peoples of the world. Today are the peasants throughout Europe who fight for their rights. Against the worsening of their living conditions due to production, against unequal competition generated by imports of foreign products, against the low prices paid by intermediaries for their products, for greater guarantees from the State to protect the local peasant production, among other fighting flags. Meanwhile, the governments of each country have responded in two ways: with promises to mitigate the struggle and with repression when the masses have expressed their combativeness and firmness in the blockages and in the confrontations with the forces of police repression. However, although governments carry out promises, European states and the European Union, they cannot solve the underlying problem: the crisis of imperialism that, in their insatiable search to increase their profits and save their decadent system, is carrying out their plans and reforms to increase exploitation over the people, to download the weight of the crisis over the working classes of the countryside and the city, and to eliminate subsidies or rights acquired by the masses in the struggles of past decades, to which, the people European has responded, and will continue to do so, with combative struggle and organization.
