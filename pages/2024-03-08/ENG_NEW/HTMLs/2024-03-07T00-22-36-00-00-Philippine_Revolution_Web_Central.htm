  In the hearing of Congress on February 29, it was intimidated in the Confederation of Wearable Exporters of the Philippines (Conwep) the intercourse of the clothing industry if given even crumbs to workers here. In its report in the Marcos regime, it warns to lose the same 120,000 or 70% -80% of these 160,000 workers if the Senate and Congress approved the unless increase. They are added to 21,912 workers set to remove this year due to "more slow international demand."
 </p>
 <p>
  Conwep is an association of large capitalists who specializes in manufacturing clothes for the largest "global brand" (fabric brands worldwide). Ralph Lauren, Coach, Michael Kors, Adidas, Dillard's, Marks &amp; amp; Spencer and Ann Taylor. It exports the forms of clothes before the US, the countries of the European Union, the United Kingdom and Japan are next. The association dominates foreign companies, where the least has 1,000 laborers. Two of the largest companies here run 6-7 factories and employ 22,000-24,000 workers. Such companies have operations as well as other parts of Asia (Cambodia, Thailand and Vietnam). Before the pandemic, it employs to 220,000 workers.
 </p>
 <p>
  Majority of women's laborers, relatively young, and contractual. Overall, less than 17% -25% were hired by the men.
 </p>
 <h2>
  Smallest industries, leverage exploits
 </h2>
 <p>
  From the 1990s, the industry has become compassionate in the Philippines' clothing industry in the international trade in clothes. In 2020, there were 200 factories that manufacturing country clothes, 240 traders and more than 1,000 subcontractors. It employs more than 490,000 workers in different capacity, and majority or 69.4% of these women.
 </p>
 <p>
  In 2020, the Costeemical Covid-19 is used to implement the expansive removal, diversity of wages and additional flexibility. It placed in the "floating status" thousand workers while it was directly united. The factory remains worse under the Taiwanese sports city international company, the largest employer in the Mactan Export Processing Zone. In 2020-2023, less than 12,000 workers lost work when it moved operations to its factories in Vietnam. Released to the Conwep "save jobs" the deletions. Actually, retrenchments were made to keep the degree of profitability to the workmanship of Philippine workers.
 </p>
 <p>
  Like the other company within the entrance, the foreign capitalist in the Conwep is enjoyed with no corresponding privileges and incentives. Includes tax holidays, "duty-free" or taxable entry of necessary material, use of advanced infrastructures built using public funds, "flexible" labor, and subsidies and rent. They also take advantage of the extra taxation of taxation under the Create law. Invalid but actual, it is implemented within the "no union, no strike."
 </p>
 <p>
  Foreign capitalists are allowed to bring their entire income in the Philippines. As it happened, its factories were arrested in the Philippines with no workers.
 </p>
 <p>
  In 2023, the Conwep recorded more than $ 1 billion worth of export. For 2024, the Foreign Buyers Association of the Philippines is estimated that it is likely to improve 2% or to $ 1.33 billion due to entering new orders.
