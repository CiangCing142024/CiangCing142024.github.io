 <p>
  The situation in the two large industrial groups, the arcelrmittal, from 
 Today in extraordinary administration and Melfi's Stellantis, 
 should concentrate the attention of the trade union movement, 
 confederal and basic and workers in general, because they are around 
 to the events of these two large factories, two great complexes 
 industrialists present in several Italian cities, the game is played 
 of the general recovery of the workers' struggle, which as always 
 We consider fundamental for an authentic class unionism e 
 To give workers and popular masses, an inevitable point of 
 reference in the more general struggle against masters and in particular 
 against this government.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The decree that 
 introduces the extraordinary administration in the Acciaierie Group 
 of Italy passed the first passage in the Senate and, in the next 
 days, with the approval in the Chamber, he will have completed his process. 
 This decree enjoys the support of all confederal unions, 
 According to different shades. In this it must also be considered the 
 position of the USB which is of substantial support, albeit with distinction, al 
 government decree. If we look at things, from the point of view 
 of workers and workers immediately appears that
  <span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <a name="more">
 </a>
 Slai is right 
 Cobas for the class union in Taranto, who said during 
 All this period - and also says it in these hours - that 
 The extraordinary administration is not the solution, but, indeed, it can 
 be a worse remedy for evil.
 <p>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  And in fact 
 What are the immediate consequences? than with the Administration 
 extraordinary we witness the replay of a story traveled over the years 
 past, that is to say the insolvency of Ilva, in bankruptcy 
 substantial, which is discharged on the workers, in particular of the ILVA contract where this download produces in the companies 
 of the contract for a situation that, to put it with an euphemism, 
 according to the declarations of industrial associations it involves 
 of the contract, layoffs, permanent layoffs, a 
 Combattorio worsening of working conditions if it will be succeeded 
 to resume the work.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The devices 
 financial, administrative, inserted in the decree do not escape the 
 basic question that the masters, the names of the contract e 
 of the survey in general, they will not have the money that they say they are advancing 
 from Italian steel mills. The administration commissioner 
 extraordinary is proposing to the companies to resume work 
 paying him in advance the future works, those who resume, but not 
 they give any kind of insurance regarding the previous. 
 In these conditions it is difficult for many of the contractors to really resume work and, indeed, to follow, to the 
 contrary, after the generalized request for layoffs, 
 the announcement of collective layoffs.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This involves 
 Many problems also for the direct workers of the steelworm, where 
 Already in this month they are found with two paychecks, one up to 
 period in which this company is steelworks of Italy and another in 
 new period since it is commissioned.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Two pay slips 
 that, far from being a technical problem that can be remedied 
 Since the next few months, it is a spy of a more substantial problem: that 
 Fine is the previous workers? It is also inserted in the 
 picture of the insolvency, in the liability, and therefore payable it is not known 
 when? And secondly, what happens to the holidays, why 
 ArceloRormittal in recent months had transformed into the cashier 
 integration the holidays and as a consequence 
 Workers still have many holidays to consume but are faced with a different corporate structure. This as problems 
 immediate.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Much more serious 
 The problems on the future we will talk about in shape appear 
 widespread in a public meeting in Turin on Monday that opens one 
 National campaign of the Slai Cobas for the class union for 
 clarify the matter and return it to workers and workers, 
 First of all by Taranto, but also of the other Ilva plants and the universe of national steelurgery and the entire class 
 factory Girl.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  So let's give 
 Appointment to the report-report of the 11marzo assembly a 
 Turin, also organized with the collaboration of Medicine 
 democratic and the lawyer Vitale who takes care of the civil parties in 
 "Educational environment" process. Of this story and how much it 
 affects in the general Ilva affair at national and local level, 
 We will speak widely on the occasion of this assembly.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  On the question 
 Stellantis must instead overthrow the speech, start not from 
 government/owners diatribe which will however find its own solution, but 
 of what is materially happening in the factories.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  In Melfi the first 
 Problem is, also here, the contract, in Mirafiori and Polignano is 
 the announcement of employment cuts and we had the story of the 
 death at work in Pratola Serra.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Much “meat a 
 Cook ”, as they say. On this we are supporters 
 of the workers' autonomy, of the establishment of the establishment for 
 establishment, of the forces necessary to counter the Government Plan e 
 masters, of a connection network of them, of an intersindacal type 
 and basic, which can allow a common action of the most part 
 advanced and combative of the working class.
