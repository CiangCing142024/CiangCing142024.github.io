  On the morning of Thursday 7/3 the 57 -year -old disabled Fighter Professor G.N. Siebaba came out of the central gate of the Nagbur prison, after ten years in which he suffered a prosecution and imprisonment in particularly harsh conditions under the responsibility of the reactionary Indian regime. On Tuesday 5/3, a 293 -page ruling was made by the Nagbourg section of the Mumbai Supreme Court, with which he acquitted him of the charges he was sentenced to life imprisonment. He ruled that the evidence that had associated him with the illegal Kkindia (Maoist) and were built by the police authorities, were unfounded and even violated these so -called anti -terrorist laws and that the decision of the Primary Court in 2017 was unsubstantiated. It was then March when the local court in Gadchiroli had sentenced him and four others - Prashant Rahi, Mahesh Tikri, Hem Keshwdatta Mishra and Pandu Narote - in life imprisonment. The sixth defendant, Vijay Nan Tikri, was sentenced to 10 years of strict imprisonment.

 The acquittal of Siebaba and his five co -defendant comrades is the second in a row, after October 2022 with the same up -and -down. And then, as now, the reactionary government of the Maharastra State in cooperation with the federal in New Delhi has appealed against it, but this time, at least for the time being, it was not requested to continue his sentence. The authorities, of course, even at the last minute tried to delay liberation by putting bureaucratic obstacles. In his first statements during a press conference, Saybaba said that he was coming out alive from Katergos as his health over the years has worsened significantly from the excruciating conditions in the cell. He pointed out that one of his five co -defendants, 33 -year -old Pandu Narote died in prison on August 25, 2022, saying: "A young man who belonged to a primordial race had to wither in prison with us. Had a little daughter. He suffered so much. Is this justice? " He thanked those who supported him and spoke especially about his lawyers' struggles in the case of Surendra Gadling who has been imprisoned under the anti -terrorist law: "A lawyer who fought for justice, who has represented hundreds and thousands Court of Justice, such a man is in prison. If justice must be fully attributed to my case, then Gadling should be released. " Gandling became the target of the Indian authorities, among other things and why he was a legal defender of Siebaba.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The second acquittal is a loud slap for the reactionary forces in India. The decision and liberation of Siebaba and the rest of the fighters who are out of prison with a high prison was welcomed by a number of organizations and movements in the country and internationally and is a victory for the great solidarity movement for political prisoners in India. It reinforces its potential to get out of the cells and other political prisoners who condemned the Indian regime for their ideas and struggles for a society without injustices and inequalities.
