    Ponte Galeria: the hard complaint 
 of the Senator on the front line against the repatriation centers. Yasmine 
 Accardo (leave): "There is no protection of rights e 
 recognition of people who are imprisoned in these concentration camps 
  state. In Rome, the stop-cpr network is being born ”you are attempted suicide in seven days. The tension to the CPR of 
 Ponte Galeria salt day by day after the disorders of the last 
 month. A list of despair that stretches after protests for 
 The conditions of invivability inside the center for the repatriation of Rome. 
  A prison in all respects with high rallies closed cages 
 Over eight meters, reduced hygiene to light, solitude and despair 
 of those who are not even understood when he speaks

   After he tried 
 to hang himself and transferred to Sant’Eugenio. “The reality of the CPR is one 
 reality that is now collapsing. In the last few days they are counted in Ponte 
 Galeria an average of an attempted suicide a day, practically one 
 massacre. Indeed the thrilling hypothesis is that migrants try suicide 
 Hoping to return to freedom because it is not suitable for life in community. 
 All this happens in the general disinterest but instead it is time to 
 tell them these places and demand that they are closed - says the 
 parliamentarian Ilaria Cucchi -. Three guests were declared not 
 suitable and wonders why they were in there. I will do everything 
 what is in my possibilities starting from a question 
 parliamentary. And as happened in the city of Ferrara, where 
 We paraded in 1,500 associations and civil society, we will continue 
  to do in each city to ask that the CPR be closed. "

    On February 29, three were attempting to end it 
 Always binding the sheets to the railings: Salhi Saber, El Maddahi 
 Othman, Mohamed Alì Eltayahi. On February 4th there was one 
 protest at the CPR for several hours following the death of Ousmana Sylla, 
 The 22 -year -old from Guinea, who was found hanged with a 
 Lip to a grate. The young man, before killing himself, left a 
 Message that is a testament: he wrote his name, his own on the wall 
 surname, his village of origin. And a prayer: “Please, 
 I report my body in Africa, I miss my country a lot, me 
 My mother is missing. Law enforcement officers do not understand anything, 
 Not even my language. I can't take it anymore, I just want my soul 
 rest in peace". During the disorders two were injured 
 military and arrested fourteen migrants.

    On March 4, two were hospitalized at the Aurelia 
 Hospital and Sant’Eugenio. This is Barry Abdoulaye and Mohamed 
 Elbikri. Just from the latter boy, 23 years old, the count began 
 of attempted suicides because the girlfriend had tried to get in 
 Contact with the CPR to find out what happened to. "My boyfriend 
 Yesterday he got dressed in Ponte Galeria, was taken to the hospital but not 
 We have news. His name is Mohamed Elbikri, he asked to be 
 repatriated. In the last two weeks it was always under therapy almost 
 Sedato ”, the woman had written in a message to the associations. And and 
 came to the surface that Elbikri was not the only one who had in the last few days 
  tried to kill himself.

   <p>
    "Where there is no protection of the rights and recognition of people 
 which are imprisoned in this system of status concentration camps - he says 
 Yasmine Accardo, to leave -. To make that evident 
 violence do it with an act of violence towards themselves, to give 
 Meat to a body that is continually disconnected in this country. 
 We are very worried because despite years of complaints, the state 
 Continue to propose new detention systems. In Rome he is creating 
 This new network against CPR called "Stop CPR" and we will continue to 
  beat us "
