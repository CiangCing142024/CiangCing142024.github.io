 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This year on March 8 who is approaching is a special March 8, it comes 
 After the large demonstration of half a million people, the 
 Stragrande majority women and girls, who was there on November 25th 
 in Rome who expressed a force, a potential of struggle, of 
 Women's units, which really great.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  And therefore 
 This year on March 8 it must be - and it will also be - one 
 mobilization with the women's strike at the center, one 
 vast mobilization that will be in every city, from North to South, to 
 center, in every workplace, in every neighborhood, in every sector 
 in which women work more and more exploited, more and more 
 discriminated against, more and more oppressed.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  We want 
 Place two realities at the center of this March 8. On the one hand the reality of 
 workers, of the workers who in recent months, in this past year but which will continue in a very heavy situation in which the 
 Loss of jobs is becoming an almost normal way 
 which above all is also involving the workers of the greats 
 factories. At the same time, beyond the data and
  <span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <a name="more">
 </a>
 complaint 
 that appear in the newspapers, the condition of enormous differences, 
 wages, duties and rights of the workers, always falls 
 lower.
 <p>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But nevertheless 
 This, in recent months, also workers, the workers, have never 
 stopped fighting and do not stop, they cannot be stopped.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Often theirs 
 struggles, their needs, their conditions, are not visible, not 
 are the subject of news of the mass media or when they are needed 
 To get scored data, to make commitments every now and then, without then 
 These commitments are made in the least.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Indeed, the problem 
 that what is happening to the condition of proletarian women 
 contains all the oppressions a little, all the attacks that there 
 They are towards the set of women and we would also say towards the whole 
 of workers and popular masses.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Women 
 they continue more and more to be discriminated against salary, though 
 By doing the same job, carrying out the same duties as men, they continue to 
 Take less.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Those who on 
 print, but also by the masters, by the squalids 
 government ministers, raise these wage discrimination like this 
 like discrimination with respect to the work possibilities of whom 
 has stable and non -ultra precarious work, they do it with a purpose that 
 The solution worsens, as when some related journalists say 
 to the mastery to raise wages to stop denatality. So it 
 The purpose of these complaints, of these "solutions" to women 
 workers is not to improve their condition, but that 
 that if they take more, perhaps they will make more children, and there is no mention of the 
 problem of how to keep any children.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The whole campaign 
 On the birthday, to make more children, it is expressly linked to the fact 
 that women must return to play a central role for this 
 bourgeois system, to a central role that sees them committed to doing 
 children, engaged in the house, engaged in the care/assistance of the 
 family. So anything but to meet needs, to needs 
 absolutely fundamental of proletarian women but to make them go 
 back, to make them go to a modern Middle Ages where the problem is 
 that if women have children are "weighed"+ even for the miserable 
 bonuses, for incentives to the masters if they take women who have 2, 3 
 children etc.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Instead women 
 who have no children or they are alone, these have no right, not 
 They are almost considered people.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This condition 
 of women, a condition that is not only practice, but that it is ideological 
 and cultural, etc., is going to tandem with an increase in violence 
 sexual, feminicides.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  It can be said that 
 Now the data and statistics that were a year ago of a woman on 
 Three killed, in reality they are clearly increasing, they are overcome by a low intensity war than sometimes 
 It is striking the workers, as often in the latest feminicides 
 it happened.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  And how does the government respond to this? The government responds with more police 
 above all, with more secular measures that do not solve 
 At all, that the feminicides do not stop at all. Indeed, not 
 Let's forget that even among the last feminicides - for example 
 those of Latina - These, but many others also were committed 
 by men of the armed forces, by policemen, finance guards, etc.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  So, together 
 to the campaign for the birth rate, to have children, arms to be exploited, 
 new arms for capital and above all arms, meat, for the 
 wars that gradually increase and increase the role of ours 
 imperialism, Italian imperialism, this then goes together 
 Attaching to the right of abortion on which there are some signs but 
 The future also promises to be truly black.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  All this is 
 a fascist use that produces, feeds a modern patriarchism of 
 hateful males who react by killing, when women don't want 
 Being submissive when they want to break the ties.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But we in 
 This March 8th we want not only the complaint, anger 
 for everything that is falling on women, on the condition of 
 in particular life of the most exploited and more oppressed women, 
 of poor women, but we want to bring an element of rebellion, of 
 struggle, of trust in the possibility of not passively suffering everything 
 this, but to be able to fight, to be able to defend oneself immediately from 
 measures, from politics, by ideology, from the attacks that 
 they are on the agenda, but above all fight to overturn 
 this reality, because all life must change, overturn it with 
 The only possible weapon also for women - indeed even more so for 
 Women - with the weapon of the proletarian revolution, in which women 
 They bring, precisely because of their condition, not an oppression, but total oppression as such, bring an extra gear.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  And in this the 
 workers, the workers, are the center of this battle, because 
 they are together and know the value of the unitary struggle, 
 they know the value of the strength and therefore they are the ones who have more 
 interest, more possibilities, to take a struggle in hand 
 collective and therefore must go beyond the trade union struggles that 
 they already do with the disputes to carry on a general struggle that 
 be also avant -garde and example for all women.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  In the same 
 time this March 8 is an internationalist March 8, is a March 8th 
 Which is fully on the side of Palestinian women.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This March 8th 
 Palestinian women are at the center of solidarity by the 
 Italian women and women of all countries.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Women 
 Palestinians are massacred to tens and tens of thousands, they are the 
 70%, together with the children, of the dead for the genocide that continues 
 undaunted to carry on the Nazi Zionist state of 
 Israel. But at the same time these women massacred, hungry, that 
 they see their children killed under the bombs or died of hunger, from thirst, due to lack of medicines, which cannot give birth because 
 hospitals are bombarded, which are forced to abort for 
 road, however these women carry on a resistance that 
 It is truly an example for all the women of each country and for us.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  In this sense 
 We want to strengthen our support - and on March 8 this must 
 be concrete and visible - participating, bringing this 
 solidarity in every strike of women, in each 
 initiative/mobilization and where it is possible, especially to 
 North, in Milan, in Lombardy, bring it visually to the new 
 event that will be there for Palestine on March 9th.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  We think that 
 the link between women in women should be more concrete, stronger 
 fight, the workers in the first place and the Palestinian women, both because it is 
 Our Meloni government, are our masters who are those who 
 they build weapons above all, which are the accomplices and managers 
 of the genocide in Palestine. These monsters, as our lives use 
 For their profits, their reactionary, racist, repressive plans, 
 To prevent the freedom of us women in this country are the same 
 who want to crush the Palestinian people and women. Fight 
 of Palestinian women, therefore, is our struggle, helps us against 
 This putrefied system is the struggle of us working women, it is 
 The struggle of Palestinian women, because it weakens ours 
 Imperialist monsters.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  That's all 
 This will be the center for us on March 8. The companions, the 
 workers of the revolutionary proletarian feminist movement in 
 city where they are present will make the workers' strike, in 
 particular in factories and in various jobs, as well as 
 Other initiatives.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This year 
 actually we are focusing the most important initiative 
 right in Milan/Bergamo, both as regards the factories, the 
 workers, who also in recent months have continued to fight both for 
 regarding solidarity with Palestinian women. So in 
 This sense we appeal to all workers, workers and 
 To women to take this important March 8 in their hands.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  And then 
 We will continue more and more, and even more to fight.
