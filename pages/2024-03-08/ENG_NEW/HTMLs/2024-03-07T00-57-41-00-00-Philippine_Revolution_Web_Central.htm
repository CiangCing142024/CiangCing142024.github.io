  The women's protests under Gabriela on March 1 at the beginning of the Women's Month. They call: livelihood, rights, independence, not foreign chachas and few!
 </p>
 <p>
  On that day, members of Gabriela Youth, along with other youth groups, went to Mendiola to Manila to express their objection to the Marcos regime's chacha.
 </p>
 <p>
  There has been a similar action within the University of the Philippines-Los Baños led by Gabriela Youth-UPLB. According to the group, the action is united with the Purple Day of Action.

  At the same time, women's workers under the women workers united and the May Uno movement, employment, rights and termination of labor violence, launched a protest. On March 5, Gabriela-NCR also launched a protest in Manila.
