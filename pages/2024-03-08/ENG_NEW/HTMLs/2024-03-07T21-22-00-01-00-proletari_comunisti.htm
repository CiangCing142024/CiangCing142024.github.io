 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Once so much we agree with Meloni. Yesterday the lady has 
 met the police unions and the whole plethora of associations 
 of the police, carabinieri, Guardia di Finanza. And has 
 substantially declared: â€œThere is a climate that I don't like and that 
 It reminds me of very difficult years for our nation ".
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Clearly 
 This is what we share. This climate doesn't even like it to 
 we and I believe I don't like to feed students in Pisa, ai 
 demonstrators under the Rai headquarters in Turin, of Naples, do not like it to 
 all those who in the last six months of this government have suffered 
 police offices and more, to all those who have suffered 
 harassment, persecutions, prohibitions, to all those who are 
 measuring from the birth of this government on a chain of 
 measures on public order and on the safety that attack 
 basically the freedom to demonstrate, the freedom of protest, 
 freedom of association and are continuously found at risk 
 aggression, repression, complaints, processes, by this 
 government and of this state, whose ministers, undersecretaries, demand 
 impunity, they make victims even when it comes to obvious 
 violations of laws and constitution, even when it comes to 
 Open phenomena of corruption and conflict of interest. And the list 
 Here he should concern several.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Instead it is the government that makes the 
 victim, it is the government that takes the field to defend police and 
 repressive forces also in the face of clearly reported situations 
 also by the entire press and even reported by the President of the 
 Republic. Instead of finding carabinieri, law enforcement officers, cops on the defendants' bench 
 violent, the manifested are put on that counter.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But this government is 
 prepare to force the repressive apparatus to make even more 
 Police will, brutality even as possible 
 detective, the repression of events, even when yes 
 deals with young and very young people who rightly make the 
 their voices that in recent times is heard around the 
 solidarity with the Palestinian people.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Essentially 
 This government provocatively raises tones and shooting and prepares 
 new narrow both in legislative terms and in terms of 
 law enforcement behaviors.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  And rightly 
 Look at the G7.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  It is clear that 
 This government is preparing for a repression of the G8 genre of 
 Genoa, of torture, of the detective positions, of the prisoners 
 arbitrary, of all the horror that constituted the G8 of Genoa and 
 prepare for a replay, this time in advance, to prevent there 
 may be the manifestations that are more necessary than ever in 
 occasion of this appointment, events that will have to 
 collect students, proletarians and all the reasons for the protest does not 
 Only against this government but against the masters of the world they have us 
 downloaded the crisis on our skin and which today prepare the war, 
 In addition to being responsible for environmental, climatic disaster, 
 In addition to being responsible for the huge massacre of migrants in 
 Mari, particularly in the Mediterranean.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Instead this 
 Government thinks about the application of a Daspo for demonstrators 
 violent, the demonstrators who rightly protest against this 
 war, against the increases in military expenditure, against this 
 repression, against this inhuman treatment of immigrants, who 
 protest against the school reform, against the attack on 
 workers rights. All these protests are assimilated to 
 ultras and anti-ultras legislation that has established the daspo 
 Now it could be extended to violent demonstrators, that is to say 
 prevent those who are reported by the police, also to participate in the 
 event. That is, a real police state, a 
 behavior of the fascist regime at the time of Mussolini, of 
 to which this government that wants it or not is direct descendant, and it 
 Remember even in forms that we call modern.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Instead of 
 Put name and surname to the policemen so that it is easier, 
 In case of episodes such as Pisa, to identify also the 
 individual responsibilities - because in this there are also 
 individual liability, because a significant part of the 
 policemen are fascists, vile cops who use the uniform for the 
 PREVERIFICATION AND VIOLENCE - Instead of going in this direction the government assigns him the Body Cam to identify protests, all kinds 
 of protest towards them, also the slogans, even the invectives 
 more than reasonable, which consequently allows the demonstrators of 
 be stopped and persecuted even after the events.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  And just as Meloni is 
 demonstrated available to the use of drones to check 
 from above the processions - which are already super controlled by 
 helicopters, super controlled by the system of cameras that does yes 
 that each event is transformed into a reason to hit 
 Active demonstrators - drones want to consider them as if we were 
 In a war, drones have been used and are used 
 In wars, from India to Palestine, to Ukraine, to subsidia 
 War operations.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  And what the 
 Government wants to do is a war on the demonstrators and to 
 events.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  For the meeting with 
 The police unions would have to open a stadium because 
 The associations that represent the policemen, their unions are 
 always in the front row, such as forklifts and defenders of themselves, of 
 facing the most horrible ugliness we will talk about in the course of 
 This contrainformation.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The unions of the 
 police should be dissolved. Are associations that defend i 
 policemen in their most brutal behaviors, the most illegal and of 
 consequence constitute a state in the state and contribute to 
 make the police and the police of the squadristi in uniform 
 rather than what their ordinary function should be.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  You think you do it 
 quickly and this is clear that they want to do it quickly, 
 precisely because Meloni indicates in the preventive activity e 
 repressive compared to the G7 the urgency of these measures and consequently 
 We want to intervene directly in the parliamentary discussion - 
 that is already there with the plethora of the decrees on the safety of each 
 Order and degree already in Parliament - to insert these measures 
 repressive.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Then when 
 We report the police state, modern fascism, war 
 external as a general container of the internal one that becomes 
 War outside - Imperialist military interventions, like the last 
 approved by the Parliament in Red Sea, but which follows the 
 presence of Italian imperialist troops in other scenarios, 
 Including the enlarged one of Ukraine - which corresponds to internal war. It is a law of nature 
 imperialism and is a law of nature of imperialism 
 Italian, of its coalition and its main references in 
 This moment, US imperialism.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  It is clear that it is 
 a step forward towards the police state and the fascism model and is 
 clear that in these cases it is necessary to defend the 
 Rights and democratic freedoms, the freedoms to demonstrate. 
 This necessarily requires for the system of laws that comes 
 made a permanent violation of these laws. If we were to 
 Attentive to these laws we should no longer manifest but remain a 
 house or even transform us into self -adventure on house arrest, seen 
 the regulations that must be submitted.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Everything is fine 
 demonstration for this government must be transformed into a problem 
 of public order to feed the "Law and Order" campaign, use it 
 both for electoral purposes and to cover the true nature of this 
 government, a government of the owners, the government of war, the government 
 of repression.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The first rumors that 
 They got up in the room are critical: the AVS warns 
 (Left green alliance) that rights cannot be prohibited 
 constitutional on the freedom to demonstrate through an act 
 administrative like the daspo.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Clearly 
 We share this judgment. But we really think that limiting yourself to 
 Can this type of judgment constitute the opposition?
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Meloni and Salvini 
 They play those who are more gallows, the ministers from these gentlemen 
 placed in defense of public order, to police heads. The 
 widespread and widespread system of the police is such as to be 
 a armor to the government action.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This is therefore 
 A qualitative leap. Of course, we always talk about "quality jumps", 
 We also got tired of talking about quality jumps. Everything is fine 
 passage of this kind, every moment of social conflict, of 
 unmasking of the function of repression is used by 
 government to feed it further and in this sense that towards 
 which the government is marked is within the internal war, to one 
 militarization of political social conflict in this country.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Against this 
 militarization of the social and political conflict must be built 
 the tools to defend democratic freedoms and considering 
 that this defense today almost always passes from defending the reasons for 
 these manifestations with forms of organization that allows it to 
 continuity, development and their effectiveness.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Of course, we are 
 all under attack on this, even if the government's eye is towards 
 the most radical events that cross these country, therefore in recent times, in 
 Particularly the manifestations of solidarity with Palestine. It is clear that the government's eye is to hit these to hit everyone, 
 touch one to touch everyone and if we tie it to the attacks 
 To the right of strike, the repression against workers can 
 understand the nature not only of the action of the 
 government, but also of the necessary response.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  You need the front 
 united against repression. But an active process is also needed among the 
 political and social education workers because of this 
 political and social education is the formation of a real 
 avant -garde of the working class, which is also a avant -garde 
 Politics not only of the class but of all movements.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  And in this sense 
 It is up to the communists like us, to the avant -garde of the 
 Basic class unionism, be in the front row in the complaint 
 Among the files of the workers of the government repressive measures, 
 of the government's attacks on events - see the last attack 
 to the students of Pisa - and push workers to take a position, a 
 enter the field and to defend not only the occasions in which the 
 workers and workers are made signs of repressive and of 
 even political measures, in factories, in places 
 of work, to be sensitive to any oppression, to all forms 
 of oppression that this government, this state at the service of 
 Masters, make against those who oppose and manifest in this country.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  That there are no 
 misunderstandings to this is explained well by the Verona process, in which 5 
 policemen are under accusation for torture, 5 policemen are accused 
 to have participated in various capacities between July 22 and March 23, 
 therefore for a long period, in the middle of the new government 
 Meloni, to torture, beatings, humiliations towards people stopped or arrested, especially immigrants, drug addicts, 
 homeless. Among the accusations also false, omissions of office deeds, 
 Peculed, abuse of office, aggravated by racial hatred.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  A process to gods 
 criminals in uniform that touched everything. In the judgment decree 
 immediate arranged by the investigating judge of Verona, we read among the disputed crimes 
 to have "tortured with sadistic enjoyment", within the 
 Verona Police Headquarters, people stopped for identification or for the 
 possession of small quantities of hashish.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Not only that, but 
 These policemen have issued complaints, falsified minutes, abused 
 of their powers, have inflicted kicks and slaps to a Romanian citizen stopped for 
 identification until they lose their senses, with use 
 unjustified spray, with humiliation, like the one that forces him 
 to urinate in the room where he was detained and then clean it with one 
 tore up.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Of criminals, 
 of the beasts in uniform. And they are not isolated cases. It is useless to remember 
 The Cucchi case.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  It is all 
 days that things of this happen in the police headquarters 
 gender and take place with the coverage of the commands, of the police headquarters. AND 
 When they are caught we also scandalize the 
 Manifesto: â€œThe Minister of the Interior, the police unions not 
 They are constituted by a civil party ".
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  It is clear that 
 In these cases, it does not constitute a civil party means covering them, 
 it means considering them part of themselves and therefore it is clear that the 
 responsibility for what happens goes well beyond the beasts in uniform e 
 It affects the system: the Ministry of the Interior, the unions of 
 police, the self -defense of the state and separated bodies, because they 
 I am the concentrate of the true nature of the bourgeois state.
