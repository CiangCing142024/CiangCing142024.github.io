  The 38th anniversary of the EDSA uprising is commemorated in various parts of the country and overseas through protests against the Marcos regime's Charter Change or Chacha on February 25.
 </p>
 <p>
  About 5,000 people gathered in front of the EDSA Shrine in Metro Manila under the No to Chacha Network. According to the groups, one of the successes of the EDSA uprising was the 1987 Constitution, which banned political dynasties, set limits on the term of officials and other assurances that there was a "check and balance" in the state. This is what the Marcos regime wants to change, in conjunction with allowing 100% of foreign ownership to land, key infrastructure and facilities in the Philippines.
 </p>
 <p>
  The alliance also believes that the Senate and Congress should take care of the people's grievances in wage increases, lower prices, better social services and much more, rather than chacha. In the unified alliance of the alliance, it is called "unnecessary, divorced, expensive, and focused primarily on maintaining the position of those in power."
 </p>
 <p>
  On that day, the chacha alliance also launched protests in the cities of Naga, Legazpi, Cebu, Bacolod, Iloilo, and Davao. Meanwhile, there was also collective action and study in Isabela, La Union, and Sorsogon. Overseas, Filipinos conducted activities in Los Angeles, New York, and Boston in the US; in Melbourne, Sydney, Perth, and Canberra in Australia; in Hong Kong; and in Canada.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before and after the union, the groups contained in the alliance were conducted by the protests, gatherings, gatherings and studies.
 </p>
 <p>
  Apart from the No to Chacha Network, the vast alliance against Chacha was also formed among youth and women, as well as the city levels and provinces.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite the widespread objection, the Marcos regime's staff continued to maneuver to promote Chacha. The House of Representatives on February 27, the Resolution of Both Houses 7 (RBH7), the resolution of the RBH6 Senate proposal.
 </p>
 <p>
  In accordance with the couple resolutions, only three provisions will be allegedly changed when the low and high assembly is formed to a constituent assembly with a separate polling. The changes are to grant the aliens to own public utilities (Article XII, Section 11); Education sector (Article IX, Section 4); and in advertising or advertising (Article XVI, Section 11).
