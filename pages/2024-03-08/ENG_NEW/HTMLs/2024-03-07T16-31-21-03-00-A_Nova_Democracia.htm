  The Yankee Ambassador in Moscow, Lynne Tracy, was summoned on March 7 by the Russian government to deal with “interference attempts” and “subversive actions” in internal affairs in the country. The measure was announced while the Russian government is preparing for the next election period, scheduled for March 15-17, and amid intense international tensions between Russian imperialism and the United States (USA) in around military issues.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the meeting with Tracy, the government also required the Yankee embassy to cease support for three NGOs in the country. The request was based on the suspicion that organizations are involved in "anti-mischievous programs" to "recruit" agents of influence "under the pretext of educational and cultural exchanges."
 </p>
 <p>
  To complete the new milestone in increasing tensioning between Russia and US imperialism, Putin's government has said it will not tolerate interference in internal affairs, and that repression of such activities may include “expulsion as' persona non Grateful for USA Embassy employees involved in the action. ”
 </p>
 <h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Internal tensions and external tensions
 </h4>
 <p>
  The new friction of diplomatic relations, related to internal issues of the European country, occurs at the same time as Putin and Biden have been enacted in increasingly intense pugnas at the international level, especially on topics related to the military issue.
 </p>
 <p>
  One day before Tracy's call, the same foreign ministry had stated that if the United States positioned nuclear weapons in northern Europe, it would consider deposits as "legitimate targets."
 </p>
 <p>
  "The person does not have to be a military strategist to realize that such facilities will represent a source of direct threat and, of course, will inevitably be included in the list of legitimate targets in a direct military conflict scenario between our country and NATO," said the Folder spokesman Maria Zakharova.
 </p>
 <p>
  The new statements about nuclear weapons occurred after the Finnish President claimed that Finland could act as a “true nuclear disadvantage” in the region if supplied with American missiles. Finland was integrated with NATO in April 2023. The movement was seen as an advance of US imperialism to the desired siege around Russia, with the ultimate goal of establishing an anti-missile belt around the country.
 </p>
 <h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Nuclear threat
 </h4>
 <p>
  There are also other movements that have expanded the pugnas between the imperialist powers and superpowers. Earlier this week, Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov stated that Russia had captured audios by German military talking about the use of Taurus missiles in Ukraine. For Peskov, the recording confirmed the direct involvement of imperialist countries such as Germany in the war.
 </p>
 <p>
  The conversation spoke of the potential use of missiles on targets such as the Kerch Bridge, which connects the Russian continent to Crimea, attached by Russia in 2014. Russian imperialism took advantage of the alleged leakage to expand the propaganda that imperialists in Western Europe plan a war Secret against Russia and that the war of aggression against Ukraine is "justified." The German reactionary government, in turn, denied the version.
 </p>
 <p>
  Already the week before, Putin had raised the tone after Macron referred to the sending of troops to Ukraine. In response, Peskov stated that if shipping occurred, a war between Russia and NATO would be "inevitable," and that "mere discussion" about shipping "is a very important new element."
 </p>
 <p>
  The “new element” actually indicates that there is no indication of reversal in the sharpness of imperialist pugnas. With the deepening of the general crisis of imperialism, the tendency, also proven by the increase of military investments in Europe (comparable only with those in World War II) is the increasingly wars by the globe, especially in the form of wars of prey, Like that of Ukraine, but with possibilities to also evolve to open imperialist wars, even as a secondary tendency.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the same discussion, Putin went further and stated that he would not hesitate to launch the nuclear letter in case of sending NATO troops to the assaulted European country. "It has been talked about the possibility of sending NATO military forces to Ukraine," he said. “They must understand that we also have weapons to attack targets in their territory. Every tactic they invent and use to scare the world invokes a real threat of a conflict involving nuclear weapons, which would mean the destruction of civilization, ”he concluded.
