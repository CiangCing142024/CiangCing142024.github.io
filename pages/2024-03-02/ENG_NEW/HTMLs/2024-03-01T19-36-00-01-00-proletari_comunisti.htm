 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  It is difficult to do the counter -information and speak, for example, of the 
 massacre of Gaza without feeling the sense of weakness, impotence, 
 compared to what it would be necessary to do.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Let's start from 
 facts. Yesterday he shot himself on the "crowd of hungry", like 
 They write the newspapers, you shoot on those looking for bread. The ambulances not 
 They were enough. Many bodies of deaths and injured were loaded on 
 carts pulled by donkeys, others on the few cars available, others 
 still on the trailers of the trucks that had brought the aid 
 humanitarian.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The shooting is 
 was indiscriminate. Israeli soldiers shot in the head, 
 to the legs, to the abdomen. A massacre, a massacre without alibi. A 
 massacre on the Palestinian masses that the Nazi Zionist state 
 of Israel and his soldiers are trained to consider "animals" 
 with human features. So they are seen and therefore it can be shot 
 As in a hunting trip.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  No one knows 
 really how many Palestinians were killed. A first figure 
 It speaks of 114 and is a reduction figure. Many are in conditions 
 serious, transported where it was possible, taking into account that in the 
 Strip of Gaza there are no hospitals in operation, they are without 
 Everything and therefore even part of the injured are certainly at risk 
 life.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  He shot himself 
 on humanitarian aid, that is, it has fired not only on the Palestinians 
 But on all those who help them sending food, clothing - to which 
 It also appeals from the television screens -many 
 of which they are "beautiful souls" who want to put the 
 consciousness and send humanitarian aid.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Israel has 
 shot on humanitarian aid, he shot you who are solidarity, to you 
 that you do not share what is happening, that does not share the 
 genocide, which does not share the absolute impunity that this state has 
 Compared to fundamental laws, human rights, resolutions 
 UN, even to the laws of war. An out of law since 
 birth, in its constitution, which is believed to be in a position to do 
 all above and outside the law.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Of all this 
 This massacre is a page and it is not even the final page.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  It's a 
 massacre that comes from a thousand and a thousand actions of this type, from 
 a 75 -year -old employment that produced, phase in phase, massacres of 
 This type and horrors of this type. And therefore this ongoing war 
 Against the Palestinian people it is the summa, the recapitulation of all 
 wars, it is like the world war that comes now: the 
 recapitulation of all wars that never end there are 
 in the world.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  That's why a 
 A massacre without limits, to a warless war, is not possible 
 that the oppressed have limits to all their action, like the heroic action 
 of the Palestinian resistance of 7 October and those who will come - 
 because they will come, those who sow wind collect storm - and those who 
 they will come can have no limits because they fight a war without 
 limits to trace a possible war "with the limits", because 
 The conflict between imperialism and oppressed peoples will not stop today 
 nor tomorrow and we will carry it with you for years, in history 
 of humanity.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Of course, everyone 
 We would like "the abolition of wars", of all wars. But today, here and now, we have to stop a war 
 genocida, support those who resist you that necessarily have to do the 
 His counter -cingle of people.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Stop the regime 
 Israeli is the interest of all the peoples of the world and certainly not only for "solidarity with Palestine" but because it is a 
 outbreak of infection within a general trend to war that 
 It is up to stages all the territories. And this concerns everyone and in ours 
 country concerns us. It concerns us as masses, it concerns us as 
 proletarians, it concerns us as always engaged in the struggle for 
 oppressed against the oppressors, in our country as in other parts 
 of the world.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  At the 
 recapitulation of all oppressions must be answered with the 
 struggle to eliminate the evil that produces them: the imperialist system e 
 capitalist who periodically produces the monsters that embody it e 
 show the barbarism inherent in the nature of this system and, in 
 our country, the Meloni government. But the Meloni government is the last 
 arrived, even if, as always, the latest arrival tries to overcome 
 Every limit of the previous ones and therefore it is worse.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The latest arrival is an accomplice.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  In the same 
 Page of the manifesto where there is a minor article about the massacre 
 He says: “Investigation of other Economy. Italy has continued to arm 
 Tel Aviv ". Other Economy made an investigation not on weapons that 
 receives Israel - Israel has always received weapons from all countries 
 imperialists, with the arms merchants par excellence in the lead, it 
 State-war which is American imperialism and all the various 
 European imperialist countries, the war industries - behind each 
 war are profits and war is a great business, not 
 Of course, a horror is a great business of the weapons markets. This investigation 
 It concerns the period after October 7th. Other Economy did not go to 
 Discover the secret cards in the archives of the war industry or in 
 those of the Ministry of the Interior. No, he consulted Istat. What 
 that each of us could do.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Despite what the 
 Minister Crossetto, an obsceone grassone, shop assistant on books 
 pay the war industry, one of the horrors, of the small monsters, 
 in the cage of monsters that our country has given birth to the 
 Meloni government:
  <b>
   “Between October and 
 November Italy exported weapons and ammunition to Israel for a 
 value of 817,536 euros. 233,025 in October, 584,511 in November "
  </b>
  . 
 This is the Istat.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  We know how in 
 Italy were the struggles of the port and also the initiatives that 
 invite to boycott, to suspend the supply of weapons ad 
 Israel, from the ports of Genoa, as well as from the last 
 manifestation last Saturday in Palermo which had as its objective e 
 Leonardo final headquarters. And other things happened for the work of 
 All of us, where the "us" here is for the us who supports 
 truly the solidarity struggle with Palestine and the campaign of 
 boycott, "those of Milan" last week between 23 and 24 February, 100,000, mostly workers 
 belonging to basic trade union organizations and groups 
 Communists, progressive and revolutionaries, who were in the square on Saturday.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Also the network 
 Italian for peace and disarmament denounces all this, indeed 
 demonstrate how the law can be circumvented to evade controls, 
 To legalize post Faestum the sending of weapons, the trade of weapons 
 And in this case the sending of weapons to Israel.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  So say that 
 The government is complicit is little. He is the protagonist, he is an accomplice, he is in 
 a second row, not that he shot against the Palestinians a 
 Gaza - this could be an exaggeration - but surely the 
 Italian government, the Italian war industry, are part of this 
 system and of this armament of Israel that produces the massacre of 
 Yesterday, the massacres from October onwards. And future massacres, because it is 
 clear: if you don't stop them, after what we saw yesterday in the 
 shooting on the hungry, we will see worse.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Cease-fire, 
 stop the genocide ……. But here it is a question of a part of a 
 war, of the war between oppressed and oppressors, between justice, 
 freedom, self -determination of peoples, a whole series of things that 
 they would be sanctioned by the UN card, by the Italian Constitution, 
 from the principles of the Church even (with all the hypocrisy with which we can 
 say these words).
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Well, everything 
 This is reduced to stroke paper by the Zionist state of Israel 
 And we need to shout it strong and clear and that we use in depth the 
 weapons of critics. But let's consider that to stop the 
 ferocious beast, activated by the general climate and the situation 
 General World Cup, the weapons of criticism must give way to the criticism of weapons. Peoples who want peace and justice 
 And they don't want to live under this oppression they will have to overturn 
 necessarily with weapons governments, the states that produce everything 
 this, as part of the gigantic struggle for a different destiny 
 of humanity.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This is up to 
 everyone. And even if you believe yourself, you are all involved.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  And this war is 
 the war that can allow the improvement of the situation of the 
 world, the war of people can put an end 
 Endless horror.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The War of People in Palestine. The war of 
 people of the oppressed against imperialism. The war of people in 
 our country, against our government. The new resistance 
 In the interest not only of the future of Italy but of Palestine, 
 of the world…..
