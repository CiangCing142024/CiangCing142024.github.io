 <p>
  As the State of Israel continues to develop its genocide against the Palestinian People, the official death toll of Palestinians killed by Israel in Gaza has
  <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/02/29/1234159514">
   exceeded 30.000 people
  </a>
  , with thousands more unaccounted for. Even the Secretary of Defense of Yankee imperialism has
  <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/1/more-than-25000-women-and-children-killed-in-gaza-us-defence-secretary">
   admitted
  </a>
  that more than 25.000 women and children have been killed in Gaza by Israel since October 7.
 </p>
 <p>
  On Thursday the 29
  <sup>
   th
  </sup>
  of February the State of Israel committed an especially cynical act. At least 112 Palestinians who were waiting for aid were
  <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/1/flour-massacre-how-gaza-food-killings-unfolded-and-israels-story-changed">
   massacred
  </a>
  by the IDF. More than 750 people were wounded. Thousands of people, in desperate need of food, water and medicine, gathered early in the morning waiting at Harun al-Rashid Street, in northern Gaza, where aid trucks carrying flour were believed to be on the way. When the trucks arrived the IDF started shooting the gathered civilians with all kinds of military equipment. When people returned to the trucks after the first round of fire ended, the Israelis opened fire again. A journalist on the scene reported that “after opening fire, Israeli tanks advanced and ran over many of the dead and injured bodies”.
 </p>
 <p>
  A witness describes what happened: “We had come here to get our hands on some aid. I have waiting since noon yesterday. At about 4:30 in the early morning trucks started to trickle in. The Israelis just opened random fire on us as if it was a trap. Once we approached the aid trucks, the Israeli tanks and warplanes started firing on us”. Another person at the scene said: “We were going to bring flour … then Israeli snipers shot at us”.
 </p>
 <p>
  The IDF at first tried to blame the victims by saying that most of the deaths resulted from the panicked people trampling each other when the trucks arrived. Witnesses describe that this happened only after the Israeli soldiers opened fire. The IDF later changed their story and claimed that they opened fire because the gathered people were a threat to them.
 </p>
 <p>
  More actions of solidarity have been carried our since we

  , Brazil, hundreds of people attended a demonstration in solidarity with the Heroic Palestinian Resistance on the 26
  <sup>

  of February. The demonstration marched for an hour before reaching the US Consulate. During the demonstration red paint bombs hit the consulate. Yankee and Zionist flags were also burned by the participants, while shouting “Death! Death! To imperialism” and “Yankees! Go home!”.
