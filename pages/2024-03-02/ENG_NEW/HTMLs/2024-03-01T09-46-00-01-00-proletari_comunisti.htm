 <p>
  The new infamous massacre in Palestine highlights that there are no limits to the genocidal plan of the Nazi -type Zionist state of Israel.
 </p>
 <p>
  All imperialist countries, use in the lead, and the Italian government, are complicit and direct responsible for what is happening.
 </p>
 <p>
  All international institutions, UN on their heads, show their impotence to condition any form the concrete action of the Zionist state of Israel.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the European Court of Justice will have to condemn Israel for crimes against humanity and genocide.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the face of this horror without planned and realized limits, there can be no limits to the resistance of the Palestinian people, international solidarity.
 </p>
 <p>
  It is necessary to hit the heart of Israel and the imperialist states in all forms in all forms, first of all for us.
 </p>
 <p>
  The boycott is needed at all levels of Israel by all the states of the world who do not want to witness what is happening.
 </p>
 <p>
  It is necessary that international solidarity, which is a weapon, "yes arms", and that no place attributable to the state of Israel can remain at peace.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, you need to go down to the square wherever it is possible from this Saturday, and give this mobilization a permanent character.
