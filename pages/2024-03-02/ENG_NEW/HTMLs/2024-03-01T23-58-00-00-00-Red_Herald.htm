  On the 28
  <sup>
   th
  </sup>
  of February there was a general strike and mass protests in Greece, led mainly by yellow unions such as the PAME of the revisionist KKE. We have received reports via email.
 </p>
 <p>
  28
  <sup>
   th
  </sup>
  of February marks the 1-year anniversary of the murder of 57 people at the tempi train crash which was caused by the non-existent safety measures of the Greek state. The state chose profit over the lives of its own people. No measures have been taken to punish those who are responsible for the massacre nor have any reforms happened to make sure such a thing never happens again. The strike other than demanding action for the massacre, has made demands such as increases in wages, an end to support of Israel by the Greek state and opposition to the privatization of Greek universities. One of the points of interests of this event is that the GSEE trade union formation opposed the strike, once again showing that it is nothing more than a tool of the bosses. The main participants where the ADEDY (Confederation of Greek Civil Servants’ Trade Unions), the leadership of which is made up of ND, SYRIZA, PASOK, KKE and ANTARSYA and PAME (all-workers militant front), the trade union wing of the KKE. All the oppressed of society, workers, students and peasants came together to show their class hatred and disappointment of the government. The unprecedented participation in this strike shows the rotten nature of the reactionary Greek state, which is nothing more than a puppet of Yankee imperialism.
