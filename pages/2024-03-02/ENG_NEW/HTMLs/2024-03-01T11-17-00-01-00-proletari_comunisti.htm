 working it was suddenly 
 crowded by a new wave of serious injuries: 150 Palestinians, with 
 injuries from firearms and splinters, they were brought urgently 
 After the Israeli forces and artillery have opened fire 
 on a crowd pending the arrival of food aid. THE 
 Palestinians had gathered at the Kuwait roundabout on the road 
 Salah Al-Din, south of the city of Gaza, after receiving messages 
 of text that informed the arrival of humanitarian aid coming 
 by the United Nations Agency for the rescue and use of 
 Palestinian refugees (UNRWA).

 residents of Gaza and the northern area of the strip have 
 received SMS on the arrival of the aid trucks, the news yes 
 It is widespread and hundreds of them began to head towards this 
 area, ”says Dr. Ashraf Al-Qurara, the ministry spokesman 
 of the health of Gaza. "However the Israeli artillery, 
 positioned a kilometer south of the roundabout, it suddenly has 
 started shooting directly on people waiting, with 
 bullets and grenades, killing 20 people and injuring 150 ". Yes is 
 treated, in his words, "an Israeli massacre against the 
 hungry ". Ismail Thawabta, head of the government press office 
 In Gaza, he says that this is not the first ambush of this type: 
 “The inhabitants of Gaza are afraid of the Israeli ambush in which 
 The army simply shoots as many people as possible, between 
 I hungry in search of help ". An operator on the field 
 of UNRWA responsible for the distribution of aid (which has 
 wanted to remain anonymous) explained that the agency was not a 
 knowledge of messages. He had never sent notices with this 
 methods and usually announces the imminent help of aid on his 
 official website and on the pages of social media.

   Hunt for the hungry
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p align="justify">
  The Euro-Mediterranean Observatory for Rights 
 Humans and the United Nations Office for the coordination of 
 Humanitarian affairs (OCHA) have documented four episodes until 30 
 January included, in which the Israeli army fired on 
 civilians waiting for the arrival of the trucks with humanitarian rescue. 
 This caused 72 deaths and hundreds of injuries, some serious ones, 
 According to Lima Bustami, director of the Legal Office 
 of the Euro-Mediterranean Observatory. The first attack took place 
 On January 11, when tanks armed and quadricotteri drones have 
 shot against hundreds of Palestinians gathered in Al-Rashid Street a 
 Northwest of the city of Gaza, pending the Nations trucks 
 Join that they should have delivered flour. The attacks 
 Israelis not caused have killed 50 civilians and injured it 
 tens. The second attack took place on January 22, when the wagons 
 Israeli armed have bombed hundreds of hungry civilians who 
 they had gathered at the Kuwait roundabout after they spread 
 false information that the help of the nations of the nations 
 United were coming. Two were killed and ten injured. The third 
 massacre (in which Ahmad was injured) was committed in the 
 same roundabout on January 25th. Five days later, at 16:00 on 30 
 January, the Israeli forces have again opened fire on 
 civilians, hurting several, always at the Kuwait roundabout, still one 
 time, after they gathered waiting to receive aid 
 humanitarian. “This is the fourth reported attack of Palestinians 
 ended up under fire while gathering to supply food ”, 
 states the report on the situation of the OCHA published on 31 
 January 2024. In addition to the four attacks mentioned above, witnesses 
 ocular have reported two other attacks that took place on 26 and 
 January 29, always at the Kuwait roundabout, and always after yes 
 Voices were widespread on the arrival of aid, in which six civilians are 
 killed and 30 injured. The Kuwait roundabout is the most place 
 close to the center of Gaza that the rescue trucks can 
 reach. Thawabta states that in documented cases in which 
 The Israeli army has in this way attacked assembles of 
 Palestinians, most of the attacks followed False 
 Voices widespread on the arrival of trucks, for which civilians were 
 gathered in impatient awaiting.

   The famine in Gaza in the spotlight
  </strong>

 <p align="justify">
  Khaled Youunis, who fled Gaza City and now 
 He is in Rafah, he says that his brother, who is still in Gaza, 
 He survived the massacre of January 25th. He told him that although the 
 people knew how dangerous the area, their despair was 
 For food he had pushed them to circulate the news that the trucks 
 rescue were coming. “In front of the crying of children and the 
 need for food of displaced families, who live in conditions 
 inhuman, the inhabitants of Gaza have no choice but that 
 to risk life, "he says. The deliberate attack and the killing 
 by Israel of civilians who do not take part in hostilities, 
 Including those looking for food, it is a war crime, he underlines 
 Envelopes. To this is added the deliberate induced death for hunger 
 of the population of Gaza by Israel, which is prohibited e 
 considered a war crime pursuant to article 8 of 
 Statute of Rome: “Intestitutionally to grasp civilians as a method of 
 war depriving them of goods indispensable for their survival, 
 including intentionally prevent the humanitarian aid provided for by 
 Geneva conventions ".

  <strong>
   Sadism: boxes with explosive traps 
 in Gaza
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p align="justify">
  Hunger levels in Gaza have reached a point 
 such that people grind the forage of animals to feed, 
 A reality highlighted by UNRWA in a tweet on the platform 
 Social X-Tatwitter, on January 28, 2024, entitled: “Simply 
 There is not enough food. " “Hunger suffering people have 
 made easier to attract the inhabitants of Gaza in specific areas with 
 The pretext that the aid would be distributed, before 
 kill them, "says Thawaba. This is not the only way in which 
 Israel targets the hungry. The testimonies of the displaced people 
 of Gaza fled from the north of Gaza for the South revealed methods 
 Even more horrible and perverse. A practice provides that soldiers 
 Israelis leave boxes "with explosive traps" (similar to 
 food boxes) in the houses after withdrawing from an area of 
 they had taken control. When civilians return home in 
 Search for food, exchange these boxes for food left by 
 soldiers, but when they open them they explode, injuring or even 
 killing the people who are nearby. The son of 
 Amna Issa, Mahmoud (14 years old), lost three fingers and reported serious 
 Facial and neck injuries after opening a can that the army 
 Israeli had "left", thinking that he contained meat in 
 box. “At the beginning, employment soldiers left some 
 true food, such as boxes and bread, and hungry citizens 
 they took after the army had retired, but they exploited 
 This thing and now deliberately leave boxes with traps 
 explosive, one of these devices killed my neighbor's son, 
 And another son Mahmoud wounded, "said Amna. A 
 Expert engineer of explosives (who wanted to remain anonymous) 
 of the bombers of the security services of Gaza, 
 responsible for the collection and neutralization of ammunition 
 unexploded after the Israeli military attacks, explained the 
 operating mechanism of these bombs. He explained that 
 they look like food boxes, but contain two explosive parts 
 interconnected. The upper part contains a detonator and the part 
 Inferiore contains TNT, an explosive material. If anyone removes 
 the lid, the detonator activates and emits a spark that 
 turns on the TNT and the box explodes. In the traps they often come 
 slipped sharp metal fragments to ensure maximum 
 damage, the explosion can hurt people up to a radius of 20 
 meters. "This is not a new method for employment," he says, 
 “Since Israel has prepared similar traps in the past 
 using children's dolls and toys ".
 </p>
 <p align="justify">
  <strong>
   Kill the return in search of food
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p align="justify">
  Abdullah Razzaq, a civilian from Gaza, said that 
 Israeli forces are targeting those who try to 
 go home to collect food stocks, especially when 
 They think that Israeli tanks have retired. The majority 
 part of the displaced people were forced to quickly abandon the 
 their own houses due to the sudden bombings and therefore have 
 brought with it only small quantities of food and other goods. With the 
 pass some time and the food that becomes increasingly scarce, many 
 they try to go back in order to recover the supplies from 
 own houses. "It seems that employment has understood that the 
 people need to go back to their homes, so pretends to 
 withdraw its tanks armed by this or that road or area, and then 
 Place hidden sniper high on the buildings. The area seems 
 completely empty, but as soon as the citizens begin to gather 
 Looking for food, Israel catches them by surprise, with snipers and drones 
 who shoot them ". According to reports, this type 
 of closets caused dozens of deaths and injured, in particular in 
 center and in the north of Gaza. Thawabta confirmed that the forces 
 Israeli were deliberately killing those who returned 
 to their homes in the Northern neighborhoods. But even the South is not sure. 
 In the governoring of Khan Youunis, in the south of Gaza, similar ambushes 
 were reported in Batn Al-Sameen, in the western part of 
 Khan Youunis, in the village of Qizan An-Najjar and in the area of Al 
 Balad. The citizen of Gaza Khamis Fojo believes that his son 
 Muhammad (19 years old) fell victim to one of these closets. Yes 
 He went to the Batn Al-Sameen district to take food and 
 provided at the house of a relative who had fled Rafah at the end 
 January, but from that day he disappeared and nobody has his own 
 news. Also, when the Israeli army retires 
 completely from an area, the soldiers deliberately give fire 
 to civil homes and everything they contain, especially in the north 
 of Gaza. The goal seems to be to deprive the inhabitants 
 of Gaza of their resources to exasperate the levels of hunger between the 
 population. It is difficult to estimate the number of deaths and injuries 
 deriving from these episodes since most hospitals in 
 North of Gaza are out of service or only partially work. 
 However, the Ministry of Health said at least 20 
 people were killed and about 50 wounds by “Trap 
 explosive ". The Ministry also estimated that only in the month of 
 January about 95 civilians were killed and 400 wounded in attacks 
 while they returned to their homes.
 </p>
 <p align="justify">
  <strong>
   Aim for aid convoys
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p align="justify">
  In addition to killing those who were looking for food, the 
 Israeli forces also worked hard to prevent the arrival 
 of the rescue, according to the Euro-Mediterranean Observatory, which has 
 documented several cases in which they were targeted by convoys of 
 Humanitarian aid. On November 8, the Israeli army opened the 
 fire on a humanitarian convoy of the Red Cross transported 
 medical supplies, injuring a driver and damaging two trucks. The 
 29 December the army opened fire on a convoy 
 UNRWA humanitarian, but victims have not occurred. Then, the 
 January 10, a member of the UNRWA staff was killed e 
 several injured, when the Israeli army took them to target 
 while distributing aid in the south of the city of Gaza. 5 
 February, according to the Euro-Mediterranean Observatory, the forces 
 Israeli have targeted a humanitarian convoy directed by 
 South of Gaza in the North, despite being escorted by vehicles of the 
 United Nations and Israel had been informed in advance of his 
 path and its destination. Thawabta said that, 
 By attacking the operators who distribute aid, "the army 
 of employment is intentionally foment the chaos to prevent 
 that aid reach the beneficiaries, the absence of these 
 people hinder the aid distribution mechanisms. From 
 consequently, people rush to trucks, and 
 obtaining aid becomes limited to those who manage to rise 
 on the truck first ". According to the Rome Statute, “direct 
 intentionally attacks against staff, installations, materials, 
 units or vehicles involved in humanitarian assistance "is 
 considered a war crime. Thawabta stresses that they are 
 1,300 food truck per day is needed to relieve gravity 
 of the Carestia, which is even more serious in the Governoratures 
 northern. However, in the last week of January, 
 Only 80-100 trucks per day entered through the Rafah pass. 
 Before then only 180 entered. “The city of Gaza and the 
 North Governorati are the subject of a hard and total siege in 
 concomitance with the continuous genocidal war conducted by the army 
 of Israeli employment, which prevented any help 
 It came to the two governs from the beginning of the assault, "he has 
 said.
