  While for the workers and workers of the plant of 
 Pomigliano d’Arco continue selective layoffs and the worsening of 
 working conditions, Olivier Francois, CEO of Fiat e 
 Stellantis global marketing director has announced with satisfaction that a 
 Pomigliano will make the production of the hybrid panda, at least until 2027 (while 
 The electric one will produce in Serbia).
  <o:p>
  </o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">
  The Stellantis, therefore, within the great 
 world industrial renovation in all fields of production, continue 
 to reposition themselves for the maintenance and conquest of new markets. The announcement 
 of the production in Pomigliano della Panda is part of the maintenance program 
 of the "model that has been dominating the Italian market for several years" for 
 as regards the "utility segment" in Europe ... to implement this 
 program, says Olivier, “we have in fact decided to
  <b>
   increase production 
 20%
  </b>
  To satisfy the demand for customers in Italy and Europe. "
  <o:p>
  </o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">
  But it must be said (always assuming that the choice to continue the 
 production at least for another four years
  <span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <a name="more">
 </a>
 <span>
 </span>
 it is maintained) that this choice was
 <b>
  facilitated
 </b>
 thanks to the postponement to infinity (
 <span>
  or even the cancellation)
 </span>
 from the 
 2035 deadline, the year in which the production of 
 current internal combustion engines.
 <o:p>
 </o:p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">
  This "battle" was made, so to say the least 
 shameful, at European level by the representatives of the masters currently al 
 Government in Italy (but also of France and Germany): a "battle" conducted in 
 lobby style that has already produced its positive effects for the masters, 
 because the European Union has in fact postponed any final decision on this 
 argument, cheating on the "climate effects", which is why it was born 
 The decision of the stop to 2035.
  <o:p>
  </o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">
  While the masters and their representatives to the government "work" 
 In tune, it is sure that the "increase in production" will continue to discharge certainly 
 on the workers and workers of Pomigliano who cannot be found unprepared 
 even in front of this attack.
  <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">
  </span>
  The answer 
 It takes, a well -organized answer. In this sense we asked ourselves in one 
 episode of counter -information “when an effective meeting between the workers of 
 Melfi, from Pomigliano, of Mirafiori to study the way of responding together 
 to the government measures? Responding for forgiveness plant for forgiveness 
 All plants. "
