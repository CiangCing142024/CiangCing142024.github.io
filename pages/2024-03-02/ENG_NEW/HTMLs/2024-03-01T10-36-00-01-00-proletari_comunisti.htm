 dismantle everything that represents an obstacle to the profits made with the 
 production and sale of weapons to anyone who wants to buy them, in violation of the 
 Constitution and Italian laws such as 185/90.

  “... On February 21, the Senate approved the changes to the 
 Law 185, which regulates the import-export of the armaments for which they will come 
 the mechanisms of transparency and parliamentary control over trade deleted 
 of weapons and on the banks that finance these operations. If it will be approved to the 
 Chamber, we will no longer be able to know what the "armed banks" are.

 Mission Today and Mosaic of Peace. For this reason the popular reaction is fundamental 
 To this attempt by the Meloni government to change the law 185/90 to sell 
 Weapons to all. Let's mobilize, Christians and lay people, let's get back together for

  “The world has never seen so many weapons that they always produce 
 More wars: the data are increasingly alarming. Our country is one of the great 
 Weapons manufacturers with the best performance on the stock exchange. In fact, to the third 
 worldwide there is Leonardo, ex-Finmeccanica, whose value on the stock exchange is 
 tripled, as reported by the Sole 24 Ore, on February 28, 2924. Not only that, but 
 According to some previews of the Stockholm Sipri, the military expenditure in 
 Europe in 2023 reached 345 billion dollars, while the world expenses 
 In arms they increased by 2,040 billion in 2022 to 2,500 billion dollars 
 In 2023. We are madly. A unique "civilization" law is jumping us in 
 Europe, in such a 'armed' moment like this. Banca Etica launched a 
 Appeal to put together all the realities that had promoted 185/90. "
