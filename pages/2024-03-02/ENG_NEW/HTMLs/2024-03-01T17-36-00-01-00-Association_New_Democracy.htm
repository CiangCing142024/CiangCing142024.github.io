 January 2023. Russia has made several adjustments after a disastrous year, but 
 It still seems much more comfortable absorbing large losses of troops and

   From the beginning of the invasion, Russia has been willing to 
 pay especially high cost to advance in the east zone of 
 Ukraine known as Donbas, where Avdiivka is located. Parts of this 
 region traditionally Russian speaking have been occupied by representatives of 
 Russia since 2014, and when trying to justify the large -scale invasion, the 
 Kremlin has falsely affirmed that he is defending his Russian speakers, 
 saying they want to be part of Russia.

   Kremlin's propensity to shoot more projectiles,

    We are here to discuss a range of military issues, 
 Intelligence, political and other on the invasion, the state of the 
 war. And Eliot Cohen accompanies me. Eliot is the president of strategy of 
 Arleight Burke in CSIS, former counselor of the United States Department of State 
 and author of several books. Emily Harding, director of National Intelligence

    But, most importantly, the author of the 
 Recently published memories, "By All Means Available" by Knopf, which 
 It was ... that it is a great book. Mike, thanks for doing that. And we had - 
 We have had a session about that as good. Let me start: if we could 
 Open the battlefield map. This is earlier this month. Us 
 We take out from the United Kingdom Ministry of Defense, Intelligence Defense. And the 
 What I wanted to do is remind everyone where we have come from. So you can't 
 See it on the map itself, but you visualize it after the initial attacks 
 Russians in at least five axes, did control the territory, some of the 
 which we can see here. They also tried to push down from 
 Belarus and parts of Russia to take kyiv, in what they failed. city ​​of 
 Járkov, which, as you can see, is not under Russian control, in which they failed. 
 Then we saw multiple phases in which the Ukrainians could effectively 
 Resume part of this territory, here in Kharkiv, with an offensive operation.

    Last year we saw the Russians resume territory, even in the south, in 
 Kherson. And where we are now they are a couple of things. We have recently 
 Seen the Russians to resume Avdiivka. I would say they are lit. The offensive. 
 They have military initiative at this time. They have not recovered much territory. We will talk 
 of the details in a moment. And we also have seen a lot of activity, the 
 Ukrainians point to Russian ships, infrastructure in Crimea and in the Black Sea 
 and its surroundings.

    You had a second phase, which was a counteroffensive

    This is a phase of positional war. I think it's a 
 Error to talk about it as a point of death, which is like some people talk about

 adaptation and innovation and change with the initiative going and coming.

    There is a deep campaign of attacks in the 
 that the Russians are attacking Ukrainian infrastructure. They are attacking cities

 measure, but still with real effect both in missiles of different types but

    So, if we can open the map 
 Again, I want to concentrate a little, I want to stay on this subject and 
 Ask Mike and Emily, looking at the map I want to perfect here. 
 Some of the most recent activities we have seen are here in Avdiivka, 
 that the Russians have resumed at a big cost, we are listening to figures from 
 Victims, with a grain of salt, from more than 15,000 to 17,000. The Russian casualties, which 
 They are huge if that is true.

   <span>
    And then Emily, I mean, what is you 
 General opinion about the important or what success has this had for the Russians? 
 I mean, some people have done a big thing about this. than the Russians 
 They are now offensive. They have Avdiivka resumed. But what is you

    I would start saying that it is really 
 A misinterpretation of what happened in World War I. You already know, 
 We, our mental image of World War I comes from an amount

 trench,
    <o:p>

  <span>
   <span>
    Actually, World War I 
 It was a very interactive war in which both sides are innovating the whole 
 time. It was a positional war. And then what happens? And this can be 
 A little misleading. You know, armies do not move at their average rhythm 
 Advance. What happens is that they are slugging, slugging, slugging, and then, boom, there are 
 A great advance and everything suddenly is going very deep.

  <span>
   <span>
    <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">
    </span>
    This is like German offensives in 1918. 
 It is true for many wars. Even as the first Gulf War, there are, 
 You know, 40 days of bombing and then, suddenly, the war opens 
 land.

    I think the other way in which the 
 World War I analogy is misleading - and again, it is because the 
 people do not know the story, the reality type of tactical and operational history 
 of World War I - is the assumption. This is simply a 
 butcher shop and there are many casualties. I do not want to minimize that - and it is absurd and there is no, 
 You know, no particular innovation. Actually, this is a war in the 
 That there is a lot of innovation, in which, I would say it in this way. I think the 
 Ukrainians innovate from the bottom to top and the Russians tend to innovate 
 from top to bottom. The Russians have a very vertical command system, by

    Ukrainians are a free society, 
 So there are many boys with interesting ideas that come out and try things and experiment. 
 Both ways to do so have their advantages and disadvantages. But what 
 It is certainly not, a, it is not static; And B, it is not a conflict in which only

    So Mike, have you seen big 
 surprises so far? Honorable. Vickers: First, let me agree 
 with Eliot about the deceitful parallels of World War I. An area 
 Where I think there is a bit of similarity is that it also has attributes of a 
 war of relative industrial capacity and the ability to permanent 
 Societies until you get the advances that Eliot spoke and continuous innovation.

 I want to mention something that the United States has provided so far. 
 Then we can go to the maps. Around 2 million bullets of 155

    There is a cube

 the conflict. It simply has not happened. Russia as interested as us 
 in maintaining this restricted to Ukraine. And the more that we allow them to follow 
 advancing without retreating, the most will press. Russia is a thug. They respond

    My old

 what you did - you raised the perspective of other countries, including some of 
 Our adversaries. I think people can forget or not realize that 
 When it comes to the Russians, you know, the Russians have also spent 
 Significant amounts of ammunition in this war too. So, the 
 Ask, in part - and that goes through drones and - where do they get help 
 the Russians? And for those who want to focus or think we can 
 focus (the United States can only focus on one theater at the same time, so 
 that we should really focus on Taiwan, or even only Israel, or - and what 
 We cannot do that, the reality when you look cooperation is that the Chinese 
 They have provided significant help to the Russians. And it has been in all 
 Areas, not in wholesale weapons systems. But a range of technology for 
 Russian weapons systems that include everything from microchips for systems 
 Weapons to pieces for ammunition.

    The 
 North Koreans have provided rockets and ammunition to the Russians. The Iranians have 
 provided the Shahed-136 and other drones. Then we are seeing the Russians receiving a variety of help 
 of the Chinese, of the North Koreans and the Iranians, which makes states

 leads to aerial capabilities, land capacities, naval capacities, including 
 The anti -submarine war. That takes you out of the percentage problem. And much more to 
 The capacities to perform operations.

    So, returning to its European point, yes, it is 
 important to spend more on the Ministry of Defense. That 2 percent threshold 
 In a certain sense, it simply highlights that. But at the end of the day, I think 
 It is also important how they are spending their money. So, if we can achieve 
 this. I'm going to go with Mike in a second with a question. But if we could show 
 The image here. I just want the 
 people see here. This is one of the Iranian drones, the Shahed. 136. This was 
 Disabled in kyiv, and is now in possession of Ukrainians. You can also see 
 Here it is an Iranian drone. And here this Iranian flag is on the side. 
 So this gives us an idea of some of the other countries that have been

 Little about this, but what do you have? Well done, in your sense? Where has you fought? 
 And are we seeing some? Evolution of the Russian concept of operations? They used 
 more air than had in the past in the offensive of Avdiivka. What does it mean

 Where the Russians have done the best they can really be in this position of position

 then those two things - and, in addition, the nine months, essentially, they were given 
 To dig, prepare, put mined fields and other things that made the 
 Ukrainian summer offensive last year was very problematic. That, and the 
 lack of aerial power of the Ukrainians. You know, we essentially ask 
 Ukrainians to fight a war in a way that the US army 
 or the Western military would never do it. And you know, you just can't 
 win that way. That is, it is military negligence.

 It is where they have done better. They have done the worst they have been able to in the field 
 Integrated combined weapons operations, airborne operations. AND 
 This is something we have seen with the Russian army in the Russian-Georgian war. 
 They thought they had plans to fix these things, you know, of the 
 learned lessons. They have not really done a good job. And you know, if everything 
 There seems to be worsened as the scale has increased. I mean, your 
 Great advantage at this time is really in resources. And it may be
