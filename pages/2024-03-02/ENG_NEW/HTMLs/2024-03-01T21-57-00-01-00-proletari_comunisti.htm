  The violent police charges, in particular against the students 
 of Pisa who manifested for Palestine on the occasion of the 
 Day of the General Strike of 23 February called for 
 Basic unions - but remember that the police also attacked i 
 parades in Florence, in Catania - immediately aroused throughout the 
 country on the one hand a great indignation at the mass level e 
 on the other a great more than just solidarity that is immediately 
 given the same evening in Pisa, when thousands of people, of young people, 
 of students, workers, women, have actually invaded, in 
 Solidarity protest, the Piazza dei Cavalieri, that same square that 
 In the morning, to the sound of Manganello, the policemen had prevented the 
 students to reach, an event that has also expressed itself 
 As part of the great event that has been there 
 In the aftermath, on February 24 in Milan for Palestine and which is 
 continued to date with multiple initiatives that have been there 
 In schools, in the university, with banners, signs, assemblies 
 of the students, also took positions of the teachers, of the workers, 
 in the more than right occupations that the students are doing (ad 
 example in Milan 5 high schools were occupied in 
 these days).
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  So solidarity continues.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  In this picture 
 The President of the Republic, Mattarella, was in fact 
 obliged to take a position by talking about "bankruptcy", 
 referring to the batons used against students who have the 
 right to manifest and express their thoughts according to that 
 which is the constitution still in force in this country. President 
 of the Republic then called the Minister planted to the Order 
 because he reported on what happened.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But on the contrary, 
 by the government, starting with Meloni to continue with the 
 various ministers, from Salvini to the same planted that yesterday spoke 
 to the rooms, instead the attitude was quite the opposite: from a 
 Absolutely arrogant silence of Meloni until a few days 
 Fa, who then, as part of an interview that made to 
 Rai tender tender, to a journalist's question about 
 These events immediately took a position in defense of the police, 
 saying that it absolutely does not have to be criminalized, and 
 on the other hand he made what his is out once again 
 fascist nature, ideological, political, but also in general of 
 government of which he is at the head, when he says that in this country anyway 
 Nobody prevents us from manifesting and indeed Italy is a country in which 
 It is still allowed to show for Palestine when there are instead 
 countries where it is no longer allowed, as if to say that if there is it to date 
 It was the events for Palestine is because we - 
 government- we allowed you, but we could also decide not to 
 make you more manifest for this.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  So even one 
 sort of fascist threat. And it is no coincidence that the proposal of 
 law that Salvini's League has already presented, aimed at preventing the 
 de facto events for Palestine, exploiting the 
 question of antisionism, it is certainly a step forward, a 
 forward piece of this march that the government wants to put in 
 Acts, as all the spaces is increasingly narrowing more 
 democrats and increasingly imposing a police state, of which 
 One of the very serious events was precisely what it is 
 Success in Pisa.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  On the other hand, there was also the arrogant contempt for the demonstrators, of 
 students violently attached by the police, who expressed the same planted when he reported to yesterday's rooms, 
 confirming the reactionary and fascist nature of this government, 
 saying on the one hand also cracks, then bales, as we said 
 Other times in these counter -information - and to say balle is 
 just a trademark of this government, starting with the 
 Garbatella Meloni fascistella - but above all by moving 
 constantly attention from the boys eaten in an unprecedented way, 
 As the teachers themselves said who lived live 
 to police offices, to criminalize them and to defend 
 Instead a police who "would be constantly attached to this 
 village".
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The minister has 
 Said: “allow me to underline the right of members 
 to the police forces not to suffer summary processes. They are workers 
 who deserve the utmost respect. The management of public order is 
 a daily commitment, delicate and not without risk, carried out with the 
 Maximum dedication from women and men in uniform ".
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  And here it would be there 
 immediately to say that this management of the public order “carried out with 
 dedication ”, in reality then it is totally erased when in Rome, 
 As happened two evenings ago, a new gathering is made of 
 fascists who praise fascism with Roman greetings, protected by 
 Cordoni of the police and nobody denounces them, nobody there 
 Manganella, nobody prevents him from manifesting. And these would be 
 precisely the workers who deserve the utmost respect and that 
 they would carry out their work with the "maximum dedication", having 
 sworn on a constitution that prohibits the apology of fascism?
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Still 
 Planted: “There is still an atmosphere of growing aggression in 
 comparisons of the police who aim to raise the 
 level of contrast between the square and the institutions ".
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  And who would have 
 This purpose?
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Planted not 
 He naturally says. And therefore either it is a crack, a bale, or it would go 
 at least investigated for silence.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  In its 
 information to the de facto rooms then constantly accused the 
 students who would not have respected the law, who would violate 
 the law in Pisa because no notice had been submitted to the 
 preccint. The minister says. “The risk of violence is zero 
 If the demonstrators do not implement dangerous behaviors ". 
 So plane is to understand that young students 
 Manganellati who protested against the genocide in place in 
 Palestine would have implemented dangerous behavior and that 
 So if they would seek it.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But not only. 
 Also they had to be eaten because the policemen who were the ones who 
 They had to save themselves when planted says that: “To guarantee 
 the safety of police operators, compressed against 
 the vehicle connected behind them, a charge was carried out 
 lightening, allowing staff to advance some 
 meter and thus loosen the pressure of the demonstrators ".
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  And after these 
 shameful words has the courage to say that the government does not have 
 However, no intention to repress dissent!
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But we remain on the accusation of not having notified the event e 
 We respond with the words of the Constitutionalist Zagrebelsky who in 
 An interview with the newspaper La Repubblica describes exactly the 
 procedure prescribed by article 17 of the Italian Constitution in 
 thanks to the public manifestations that says yes, those 
 events must be notified at least three days earlier, but 
 not "authorized" but only "communicated" because the authorities can have the 
 time to organize what you need to keep without 
 obstacles. Second, if there was no notice, then 
 possibly only those who organize could be reported and not 
 all those who participate and less than being beaten, 
 Manganellati, as happened to the students in Pisa.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  What 
 Planted does not say it is that it is not written anywhere that who 
 protest without having warned must be eaten, 
 using in fact in an absolutely shameful way e 
 instrumental, just as Meloni or Salvini also did, the use of 
 two countries and two measures when it comes to fascist rallies or when yes 
 safeguard sectors in protest, which, however, are included for example 
 in the Meloni electorate, who are neither eaten nor 
 reported, nothing of this kind.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  So all the 
 speech of planted is impregnated by the ideological conception e 
 Police state policy of this fascist government, e 
 that is, that it can only be manifested if the state - that is, this government 
 And that is the police, the repressive apparatus in the service of this 
 Government - allows it. And this is also the substance of the speech that 
 Meloni did in the interview with some evenings ago.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This 
 Of course it is a clear manifestation of modern fascism that 
 advances in this country by this government which represents the 
 more reactionary part of the bourgeoisie in power.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  And therefore in front 
 To all this we can only continue the constant complaint in 
 each area, in every place, in every initiative, in every struggle e 
 on the other hand, continue to demonstrate, to mobilize us, as is it 
 happening in these days in this country and this is, 
 Of course, all positive.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Organize and build that unit of action that is more and more 
 necessary to fight against modern fascism that the bourgeoisie 
 dominant wants to impose in every area.
