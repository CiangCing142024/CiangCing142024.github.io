  Like all in our America we know [and we clearly suffer] Yankee imperialism has imposed the greatest militarization of lackeys under their control. This need, as well as the tendency towards the facission and reacting of regimes under their splint, is born from the fear that imperialism has before its general crisis and the growth in the struggles of the peoples in the world. The above applies not only outside the imperialist powers, but also inside. Citing a

  From a nova democracy that we recently shared: “Hence the political reflexes perceived year after year. Knowing that the unresolved crisis of its regime tends to arouse increasingly powerful uprisings of the popular masses, as has happened incessantly in recent years, the ruling classes use repression as the only alternative. Only in the last two years, countries such as France or the United Kingdom have used or advanced measures and bills to restrict rights as basic as strikes and popular street demonstrations. Throughout Europe, militarization advances at a fast pace: in addition to increasing military budget, organizations such as NATO welcomed Finland as new members in 2023. ”

<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  Now we have as an exemplary expression of this militaristic tendency in the US Modern of a police training field with a cost exceeding $ 90 million.

  The Georgia State Police and especially Atlanta was the awkward witness of the 2020 mobilizations against racism and police violence, which increased after the news of the murder of Georges Flyod, who was publicly suffocating it by the racist police until the racist police until his death. As the masses lazar furiously, the fear of the Poli grew overflowing.
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  In Atlanta this movement continues to increase after the murder of Rayshard Brooks, another black worker massacred by the police during an arrest, in which Brooks resisted trying to avoid being tortured with a taser. He was killed with multiple bullets while trying to flee.
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  These struggles and the resistance of the masses in the streets have exceeded the police again and again and are the justification of the gringo imperialist state to build the “Atlanta Public Safety Training Center” complex (Atlanta Public Security Training Center) In the forest, south of the city that in its history has not only for genocide and forced displacement against the people

  , but also served as a slave estate and later as a prison that developed a new slave system of forced labor for almost the entire twentieth century. The planned construction includes a helipad and the recreation of a part of the city where they will train the police in the counterinsurgency simulating armed clashes in an urban context.

  The people of Atlanta have immediately stood up against this project, joining different initiatives against the formation of a police state and internal militarization. The different agendas in forest protection, against gentrification, police violence, etc. They have joined a variety of heterogeneous groups and individuals who already develop various campaigns with mass struggle that range from the forest, to the realization of marches and sabotage against machinery and equipment of the megaproject construction companies, after which the FBI and Police have made cateos and raids amid spectacular operations as taken from a gringa film.

  The latter gives us an exact panorama of the anti-democratic character of the project and confirms the reactionary vocation of the gringo government, who threatens to destroy the social fabric and peace of the African-American communities around the place, and of the same population originally from the forest. In the same way, more than 116,000 signatures (more than twice the votes that the governor of Atlanta received in the past election) were ignored for being “late”, although a judge had ordered a extended extent in the search for signatures that were oppose the project.

  The opposition to this megaproject has left some costs, at the moment 61 activists are accused in a criminal process based on “rich” laws approved in the 70s against organized crime. They are accused of being part of an "organization in fact" and not of a movement, in addition the State considers this "organization" as a criminal for the simple fact of protesting under common slogans or names of initiatives such as "high to the police city "Or" defend the Atlanta forest. " Forty -two of these are accused of domestic terrorism for participating in marches or camps, many of them are also charged within the first process. Among them Víctor Puertas is still detained in pretrial detention for more than a year, also threatened with deportation to his country of birth, Peru.

  The repression has reached dramatic moments, such as January 18, 2023 when they murdered the young Venezuelan activist Manuel Esteban Paez Terán, 26, known as "Tortuguita." Police argue that he started the confrontation shooting against them; However, the inquiries reveal that he was subjected in his campaign home, forced to place hands up while the police riddled him with

  At the moment the State achieved the eviction of the forest and has begun the construction of the “Cop City”, but the fight continues and is not lost. That the construction of the complex already has a advance of 70% compliance, that the State speaks, it is a lie and propaganda to misinform. Photos taking the end of January prove it:

  It is obvious and well understood by the movement that the “police city” project also has relevance outside Atlanta. Citing a representative of the White House, who considers “exemplary” this megaproject that “would like to see emulated by other municipalities” is a proof that it is a pilot project; That is why in other states of the country there are protests and sabotage actions against monopoly companies and public administration.
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  Many groups in protests denounce the role of Yankee imperialism in militarization and wars against peoples worldwide, now especially the training of Zionist pigs and gringa participation in genocide in Palestine. It is increasingly frequent to observe the claims in favor of the heroic Palestinian national resistance with slogans and flags present in the manifestations against “Cop City”.

  The tendency towards the formation of a police state and militarization in the heart of the imperialist Yankee beast shows the severity of its crisis. His democratic mask is falling apart. Yankee imperialism wants to save himself in blood the rebellion of the masses, but they will fail and will be swept by this. We greet the resistance of the people in the US struggling against the same beast side by side with the oppressed peoples of the world.

<p>
   C
   <em>
    Build the game acting as a game
   </em>
   It is a phrase that lately is repeated in circular, orientations, work plans, and in not a few discussions of the
   <em>
    Communist Workers Union (MLM)
   </em>
   . I understand that highlighting that idea is to root the consciences of all classmates, the valuable idea that the best way to work to build that vanguard of the proletariat in Colombia is to give birth to it in our daily life acting each of us as if We were the most disciplined, the most active, the conscious workers who will be the material basis to build in the same practice that detachment of combatants for the revolution.
  </p>
<p>
   With that sense, in my body the elaboration of the work plan was undertaken and as part of that plan they guided us to decisively transform our performance against the study, especially fighting the harmful idea that the workers cannot become good scholars because that attitude as it was a heritage of an exclusive part called "the intellectuals."
  </p>
<p>
   But in addition, they ordered us to take the study as an organized action, guided by a collective decision and therefore provided with a good
   <em>
    Discipline dose
   </em>
   aware, so that we did not take it as an action that we would do it "when we have over time", or only when we are forced by the performance of a specific task. They called us so to speak,
   <em>
    To act in front of the study: Acting as a party!
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   It has undoubtedly been difficult to fulfill, because not in vain the education taught by the bourgeois cathedral has impregnated it to one of that unclean idea that the theory is “for intellectuals” and of course, who welcomes the theory as part of its Life, in the end will become an intellectual, but the poison is to pretend to condemn the working family to be oblivious to the possibility of rising to the quality of
   <em>
    intellectual
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   Well, there were 3 things that I assimilate of orientation: intense daily discipline in the study, combination of the theory with practice when studying and writing to share something that the study done in that way has contributed to me.
  </p>
<p>
   Today I can tell you that I am in that fight to get it, every day it has been a hard fight to achieve it and I cannot stop telling you that 100 % I have not succeeded, but that I am in that fight, if I can share them, and Each day of study achieved, has filled me with satisfaction and has left me, not only some more knowledge of the science of Marxism, but valuable elements to understand reality a little better.
  </p>
<p>
   In this first stage I have dedicated myself to Mao, to read and reread several of his writings especially in relation to the methods and there are few ideas that strengthen my love and recognition to this great teacher of the proletariat so vilified by the reactionaries , but so dear to much of the masses.
  </p>
<p>
   Today I feel more committed to this work, and with great affection for those who have the possibility of being part of these ranks that raise the red flag of the proletarian revolution, and that is why with that deep affection, I invite you to study the Marxism, and to assume with great force the truths of Mao, among which I understood the following:
  </p>
<p>
   The objective of the study is to link the MLM with the practice of the revolution:
  </p>
<ul>
<li>
    Study the current national and international situation. Not investigating is like
    <strong>
     "Proceed as" a man who hunts sparrows with his eyes closed "or as" a blind man who intends to groad fish ""
    </strong>
</li>
<li>
    Mao deals with the lack of concern for the study very hard, qualifies it as:
    <strong>
     "Treat things superficially without penetrating its details, surrender to a jactious verbiage and be content with poor and poorly assimilated knowledge"
    </strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>
     Study the story
    </strong>
    . We need to seriously study the present and past of our history
   </li>
<li>
<strong>
     Study of international revolutionary experiences
    </strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>
     Study of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism
    </strong>
<br>
    -The study must be done with the conscious purpose of satisfying the needs of revolutionary practice and not simply to study.
    <br>
    -It can be deduced that we study Marxism well, when we learn to solve concrete problems, and we notice that it is not so, when we become good to repeat phrases of Marxism if connection with practice, but we do not manage to solve the problems of our work .
   </br></br></li>
<li>
    They constitute a lousy work style then:
    <br>
    -Negligence in the study of the current situation
    <br>
    -Negligence in the study of history
    <br>
    -Negligence in the application of the MLM
   </br></br></br></li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   With strong revolutionary hug
   <br>
   An UOC partner (MLM)

  The new infamous massacre in Palestine highlights that there are no limits to the genocidal plan of the Nazi -type Zionist state of Israel.
 </p>
<p>
  All imperialist countries, use in the lead, and the Italian government, are complicit and direct responsible for what is happening.
 </p>
<p>
  All international institutions, UN on their heads, show their impotence to condition any form the concrete action of the Zionist state of Israel.
 </p>
<p>
  However, the European Court of Justice will have to condemn Israel for crimes against humanity and genocide.
 </p>
<p>
  In the face of this horror without planned and realized limits, there can be no limits to the resistance of the Palestinian people, international solidarity.
 </p>
<p>
  It is necessary to hit the heart of Israel and the imperialist states in all forms in all forms, first of all for us.
 </p>
<p>
  The boycott is needed at all levels of Israel by all the states of the world who do not want to witness what is happening.
 </p>
<p>
  It is necessary that international solidarity, which is a weapon, "yes arms", and that no place attributable to the state of Israel can remain at peace.
 </p>
<p>
  Of course, you need to go down to the square wherever it is possible from this Saturday, and give this mobilization a permanent character.
 </p>
<p>

   Solidarity and action committees for Palestine everywhere

  However, the European Court of Justice will have to condemn Israel for crimes against humanity and genocide.
 </p>
<p>
  In the face of this horror without planned and realized limits, there can be no limits to the resistance of the Palestinian people, international solidarity.
 </p>
<p>
  It is necessary to hit the heart of Israel and the imperialist states in all forms in all forms, first of all for us.
 </p>
<p>
  The boycott is needed at all levels of Israel by all the states of the world who do not want to witness what is happening.
 </p>
<p>
  It is necessary that international solidarity, which is a weapon, "yes arms", and that no place attributable to the state of Israel can remain at peace.
 </p>
<p>
  Of course, you need to go down to the square wherever it is possible from this Saturday, and give this mobilization a permanent character.

  On February 26, France's imperialist president Emmanuel Macron said he did not rule out the sending of troops to Ukraine. The statement was given at a time when Putin's unjust war of aggression against the Ukrainian nation turned two.
 </p>
<p>
  It was not clear in the French President's statement if the troops would be from France or NATO, since the agent pointed out that "there is no consensus" on the theme of sending troops to Ukraine, but that the discussion cannot be discarded.
 </p>
<p>
  Macron also stated that European countries will present sanctions against other countries that help Russia circumvent economic sanctions imposed since the beginning of the Ukraine war.
 </p>
<p>
  Despite Macron's statements, the governments of USA, Germany, United Kingdom, Spain, Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland, NATO members, publicly rejected the idea of an attack on Russia.
 </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>
   European imperialist powers prepare the War Theater
  </strong>
</h2>
<p>
  Macron's declaration occurred after France and Germany to establish ten -year agreements with Zelensky involving military assistance, the imposition of more sanctions against Russia and soldiers training. Germany granted on the day of signing the agreement, February 16, 1.13 billion euros to Ukraine.
 </p>
<p>
  Since the first Russian invasion in 2014 and especially after the beginning of the Russian aggression war against Ukraine, European imperialist powers come across the idea of facing Russia. Trump's election in 2019 and its threats to remove NATO USA had also increased the apprehension. European military fragility in the case of loss of unique hegemonic superpower support at NATO, which would be possible if Trump returned to the presidency, now lights up a new warning sign.
 </p>
<p>
  As a preparation for potential war, the imperialists of Europe are deepening their militarization. According to the press monopoly
  <em>
   The Economist
  </em>
  Europe must be able to produce projectiles at an annual rate of 1 million to 2 million at the end of this year, potentially exceeding the USA. European Union (EU) military spending has generally increased significantly and may reach $ 380 billion. Despite the new chips, Zelensky continues to seek capitulation. On the 27th, President Lacaio Ukrainian went to Saudi Arabia to discuss the terms of a peace agreement.
 </p>
<p>
  Leveraging the increase in military spending, NATO, meeting the interests of the Ianque imperialists (the unique hegemonic superpower) continues the siege plan to the atomic power Russia. Ianques' performance in sending weapons and funds to Zelensky should be reinforced in the next period.
 </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>
   Russia's reaction opens the doors to the imperialist war
  </strong>
</h2>
<p>
  In a response to Macron's statements, Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov said a war between the country and NATO will be “inevitable” if members of the unique hegemonic superpotence alliance uses to decide to send soldiers to fight for Ukraine to fight for Ukraine .
 </p>
<p>
  In his speech, Peskov stated: “The mere fact of discussing the possibility of sending some contingents from NATO countries to Ukraine is a very important new element. In this case, we have to talk not about the possibility, but about inevitability [of a war between Russia and NATO].
 </p>
<p>
  Ukrainian presidential advisor Mikhailo Podoliak took advantage of Peskov's cue to ignite the European fear of a Russian attack, stating: "This demonstrates the absolute notion of risks to Europe by aggressive and militarist Russia."
 </p>
<p>
  The imperialist atomic power Russia, which has been consolidating a militarized zone on the border of Ukraine, seems to go towards the annexation of the territory (as done in Lugansk, Donetsk, Zaporíjia and Kherson). With the response to Macron's statement, Russia (atomic power) seeks to lead European imperialists to swallow defeat in the Ukraine War.
 </p>
<p>
  These are also new signs of the crisis of the world imperialist system, which pushes the different powers to wide what they really are: carnicers who do everything to save their own skin.

 conditions of famine that Israel has imposed on the population 
 trapped to attract dozens of civilians in a fatal trap.

 working it was suddenly 
 crowded by a new wave of serious injuries: 150 Palestinians, with 
 injuries from firearms and splinters, they were brought urgently 
 After the Israeli forces and artillery have opened fire 
 on a crowd pending the arrival of food aid. THE 
 Palestinians had gathered at the Kuwait roundabout on the road 
 Salah Al-Din, south of the city of Gaza, after receiving messages 
 of text that informed the arrival of humanitarian aid coming 
 by the United Nations Agency for the rescue and use of 
 Palestinian refugees (UNRWA).

 residents of Gaza and the northern area of the strip have 
 received SMS on the arrival of the aid trucks, the news yes 
 It is widespread and hundreds of them began to head towards this 
 area, ”says Dr. Ashraf Al-Qurara, the ministry spokesman 
 of the health of Gaza. "However the Israeli artillery, 
 positioned a kilometer south of the roundabout, it suddenly has 
 started shooting directly on people waiting, with 
 bullets and grenades, killing 20 people and injuring 150 ". Yes is 
 treated, in his words, "an Israeli massacre against the 
 hungry ". Ismail Thawabta, head of the government press office 
 In Gaza, he says that this is not the first ambush of this type: 
 “The inhabitants of Gaza are afraid of the Israeli ambush in which 
 The army simply shoots as many people as possible, between 
 I hungry in search of help ". An operator on the field 
 of UNRWA responsible for the distribution of aid (which has 
 wanted to remain anonymous) explained that the agency was not a 
 knowledge of messages. He had never sent notices with this 
 methods and usually announces the imminent help of aid on his 
 official website and on the pages of social media.

   Hunt for the hungry
  </strong>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  The Euro-Mediterranean Observatory for Rights 
 Humans and the United Nations Office for the coordination of 
 Humanitarian affairs (OCHA) have documented four episodes until 30 
 January included, in which the Israeli army fired on 
 civilians waiting for the arrival of the trucks with humanitarian rescue. 
 This caused 72 deaths and hundreds of injuries, some serious ones, 
 According to Lima Bustami, director of the Legal Office 
 of the Euro-Mediterranean Observatory. The first attack took place 
 On January 11, when tanks armed and quadricotteri drones have 
 shot against hundreds of Palestinians gathered in Al-Rashid Street a 
 Northwest of the city of Gaza, pending the Nations trucks 
 Join that they should have delivered flour. The attacks 
 Israelis not caused have killed 50 civilians and injured it 
 tens. The second attack took place on January 22, when the wagons 
 Israeli armed have bombed hundreds of hungry civilians who 
 they had gathered at the Kuwait roundabout after they spread 
 false information that the help of the nations of the nations 
 United were coming. Two were killed and ten injured. The third 
 massacre (in which Ahmad was injured) was committed in the 
 same roundabout on January 25th. Five days later, at 16:00 on 30 
 January, the Israeli forces have again opened fire on 
 civilians, hurting several, always at the Kuwait roundabout, still one 
 time, after they gathered waiting to receive aid 
 humanitarian. “This is the fourth reported attack of Palestinians 
 ended up under fire while gathering to supply food ”, 
 states the report on the situation of the OCHA published on 31 
 January 2024. In addition to the four attacks mentioned above, witnesses 
 ocular have reported two other attacks that took place on 26 and 
 January 29, always at the Kuwait roundabout, and always after yes 
 Voices were widespread on the arrival of aid, in which six civilians are 
 killed and 30 injured. The Kuwait roundabout is the most place 
 close to the center of Gaza that the rescue trucks can 
 reach. Thawabta states that in documented cases in which 
 The Israeli army has in this way attacked assembles of 
 Palestinians, most of the attacks followed False 
 Voices widespread on the arrival of trucks, for which civilians were 
 gathered in impatient awaiting.

   The famine in Gaza in the spotlight
  </strong>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  Khaled Youunis, who fled Gaza City and now 
 He is in Rafah, he says that his brother, who is still in Gaza, 
 He survived the massacre of January 25th. He told him that although the 
 people knew how dangerous the area, their despair was 
 For food he had pushed them to circulate the news that the trucks 
 rescue were coming. “In front of the crying of children and the 
 need for food of displaced families, who live in conditions 
 inhuman, the inhabitants of Gaza have no choice but that 
 to risk life, "he says. The deliberate attack and the killing 
 by Israel of civilians who do not take part in hostilities, 
 Including those looking for food, it is a war crime, he underlines 
 Envelopes. To this is added the deliberate induced death for hunger 
 of the population of Gaza by Israel, which is prohibited e 
 considered a war crime pursuant to article 8 of 
 Statute of Rome: “Intestitutionally to grasp civilians as a method of 
 war depriving them of goods indispensable for their survival, 
 including intentionally prevent the humanitarian aid provided for by 
 Geneva conventions ".
 </p>
<p align="justify">
<strong>
   Sadism: boxes with explosive traps 
 in Gaza
  </strong>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  Hunger levels in Gaza have reached a point 
 such that people grind the forage of animals to feed, 
 A reality highlighted by UNRWA in a tweet on the platform 
 Social X-Tatwitter, on January 28, 2024, entitled: “Simply 
 There is not enough food. " “Hunger suffering people have 
 made easier to attract the inhabitants of Gaza in specific areas with 
 The pretext that the aid would be distributed, before 
 kill them, "says Thawaba. This is not the only way in which 
 Israel targets the hungry. The testimonies of the displaced people 
 of Gaza fled from the north of Gaza for the South revealed methods 
 Even more horrible and perverse. A practice provides that soldiers 
 Israelis leave boxes "with explosive traps" (similar to 
 food boxes) in the houses after withdrawing from an area of 
 they had taken control. When civilians return home in 
 Search for food, exchange these boxes for food left by 
 soldiers, but when they open them they explode, injuring or even 
 killing the people who are nearby. The son of 
 Amna Issa, Mahmoud (14 years old), lost three fingers and reported serious 
 Facial and neck injuries after opening a can that the army 
 Israeli had "left", thinking that he contained meat in 
 box. “At the beginning, employment soldiers left some 
 true food, such as boxes and bread, and hungry citizens 
 they took after the army had retired, but they exploited 
 This thing and now deliberately leave boxes with traps 
 explosive, one of these devices killed my neighbor's son, 
 And another son Mahmoud wounded, "said Amna. A 
 Expert engineer of explosives (who wanted to remain anonymous) 
 of the bombers of the security services of Gaza, 
 responsible for the collection and neutralization of ammunition 
 unexploded after the Israeli military attacks, explained the 
 operating mechanism of these bombs. He explained that 
 they look like food boxes, but contain two explosive parts 
 interconnected. The upper part contains a detonator and the part 
 Inferiore contains TNT, an explosive material. If anyone removes 
 the lid, the detonator activates and emits a spark that 
 turns on the TNT and the box explodes. In the traps they often come 
 slipped sharp metal fragments to ensure maximum 
 damage, the explosion can hurt people up to a radius of 20 
 meters. "This is not a new method for employment," he says, 
 “Since Israel has prepared similar traps in the past 
 using children's dolls and toys ".
 </p>
<p align="justify">
<strong>
   Kill the return in search of food
  </strong>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  Abdullah Razzaq, a civilian from Gaza, said that 
 Israeli forces are targeting those who try to 
 go home to collect food stocks, especially when 
 They think that Israeli tanks have retired. The majority 
 part of the displaced people were forced to quickly abandon the 
 their own houses due to the sudden bombings and therefore have 
 brought with it only small quantities of food and other goods. With the 
 pass some time and the food that becomes increasingly scarce, many 
 they try to go back in order to recover the supplies from 
 own houses. "It seems that employment has understood that the 
 people need to go back to their homes, so pretends to 
 withdraw its tanks armed by this or that road or area, and then 
 Place hidden sniper high on the buildings. The area seems 
 completely empty, but as soon as the citizens begin to gather 
 Looking for food, Israel catches them by surprise, with snipers and drones 
 who shoot them ". According to reports, this type 
 of closets caused dozens of deaths and injured, in particular in 
 center and in the north of Gaza. Thawabta confirmed that the forces 
 Israeli were deliberately killing those who returned 
 to their homes in the Northern neighborhoods. But even the South is not sure. 
 In the governoring of Khan Youunis, in the south of Gaza, similar ambushes 
 were reported in Batn Al-Sameen, in the western part of 
 Khan Youunis, in the village of Qizan An-Najjar and in the area of Al 
 Balad. The citizen of Gaza Khamis Fojo believes that his son 
 Muhammad (19 years old) fell victim to one of these closets. Yes 
 He went to the Batn Al-Sameen district to take food and 
 provided at the house of a relative who had fled Rafah at the end 
 January, but from that day he disappeared and nobody has his own 
 news. Also, when the Israeli army retires 
 completely from an area, the soldiers deliberately give fire 
 to civil homes and everything they contain, especially in the north 
 of Gaza. The goal seems to be to deprive the inhabitants 
 of Gaza of their resources to exasperate the levels of hunger between the 
 population. It is difficult to estimate the number of deaths and injuries 
 deriving from these episodes since most hospitals in 
 North of Gaza are out of service or only partially work. 
 However, the Ministry of Health said at least 20 
 people were killed and about 50 wounds by “Trap 
 explosive ". The Ministry also estimated that only in the month of 
 January about 95 civilians were killed and 400 wounded in attacks 
 while they returned to their homes.
 </p>
<p align="justify">
<strong>
   Aim for aid convoys
  </strong>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  In addition to killing those who were looking for food, the 
 Israeli forces also worked hard to prevent the arrival 
 of the rescue, according to the Euro-Mediterranean Observatory, which has 
 documented several cases in which they were targeted by convoys of 
 Humanitarian aid. On November 8, the Israeli army opened the 
 fire on a humanitarian convoy of the Red Cross transported 
 medical supplies, injuring a driver and damaging two trucks. The 
 29 December the army opened fire on a convoy 
 UNRWA humanitarian, but victims have not occurred. Then, the 
 January 10, a member of the UNRWA staff was killed e 
 several injured, when the Israeli army took them to target 
 while distributing aid in the south of the city of Gaza. 5 
 February, according to the Euro-Mediterranean Observatory, the forces 
 Israeli have targeted a humanitarian convoy directed by 
 South of Gaza in the North, despite being escorted by vehicles of the 
 United Nations and Israel had been informed in advance of his 
 path and its destination. Thawabta said that, 
 By attacking the operators who distribute aid, "the army 
 of employment is intentionally foment the chaos to prevent 
 that aid reach the beneficiaries, the absence of these 
 people hinder the aid distribution mechanisms. From 
 consequently, people rush to trucks, and 
 obtaining aid becomes limited to those who manage to rise 
 on the truck first ". According to the Rome Statute, “direct 
 intentionally attacks against staff, installations, materials, 
 units or vehicles involved in humanitarian assistance "is 
 considered a war crime. Thawabta stresses that they are 
 1,300 food truck per day is needed to relieve gravity 
 of the Carestia, which is even more serious in the Governoratures 
 northern. However, in the last week of January, 
 Only 80-100 trucks per day entered through the Rafah pass. 
 Before then only 180 entered. “The city of Gaza and the 
 North Governorati are the subject of a hard and total siege in 
 concomitance with the continuous genocidal war conducted by the army 
 of Israeli employment, which prevented any help 
 It came to the two governs from the beginning of the assault, "he has 
 said.

  While for the workers and workers of the plant of 
 Pomigliano d’Arco continue selective layoffs and the worsening of 
 working conditions, Olivier Francois, CEO of Fiat e 
 Stellantis global marketing director has announced with satisfaction that a 
 Pomigliano will make the production of the hybrid panda, at least until 2027 (while 
 The electric one will produce in Serbia).
  <o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The Stellantis, therefore, within the great 
 world industrial renovation in all fields of production, continue 
 to reposition themselves for the maintenance and conquest of new markets. The announcement 
 of the production in Pomigliano della Panda is part of the maintenance program 
 of the "model that has been dominating the Italian market for several years" for 
 as regards the "utility segment" in Europe ... to implement this 
 program, says Olivier, “we have in fact decided to
  <b>
   increase production 
 20%
  </b>
  To satisfy the demand for customers in Italy and Europe. "
  <o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  But it must be said (always assuming that the choice to continue the 
 production at least for another four years
  <span>
</span>
</p>

 it is maintained) that this choice was
 <b>
  facilitated

 thanks to the postponement to infinity (

 from the 
 2035 deadline, the year in which the production of 
 current internal combustion engines.

</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  This "battle" was made, so to say the least 
 shameful, at European level by the representatives of the masters currently al 
 Government in Italy (but also of France and Germany): a "battle" conducted in 
 lobby style that has already produced its positive effects for the masters, 
 because the European Union has in fact postponed any final decision on this 
 argument, cheating on the "climate effects", which is why it was born 
 The decision of the stop to 2035.
  <o:p>

</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  While the masters and their representatives to the government "work" 
 In tune, it is sure that the "increase in production" will continue to discharge certainly 
 on the workers and workers of Pomigliano who cannot be found unprepared 
 even in front of this attack.
  <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">
</span>
  The answer 
 It takes, a well -organized answer. In this sense we asked ourselves in one 
 episode of counter -information “when an effective meeting between the workers of 
 Melfi, from Pomigliano, of Mirafiori to study the way of responding together 
 to the government measures? Responding for forgiveness plant for forgiveness 
 All plants. "

<p>
  The entrance of Rede Globo's headquarters in Belo Horizonte was taken by more than a hundred people who protested last Thursday, February 29, against the complicity of the station with the genocide of the Palestinian people. The demonstration, convened by the Minas Gerais Committee on Solidarity to the Palestinian people, denounced the performance of press monopolies in the country that, according to the call released by the Committee, “promote a campaign of misinformation, lies and dehumanization of Palestinians”.
 </p>
<p>
  Press monopolies symbols were dyed with red paint, symbolizing the more than 30,000 Palestinians murdered by the criminal bombings of "Israel." Bloves in shrouded dolls represented the murdered children. Protesters expressed their indignation against more than 100 Palestinian citizens executed in Gaza that same day, shot by Zionist soldiers while gathering with trucks waiting for the distribution of food.

<p>
  The USA and “Israel” flags were trampled and burned during the protest. Dozens of candles have been lit in memory of Palestinian journalists murdered since October last year. The protest ended through a simple and exciting tribute to the US military Aaron Bushnell, who set him fire in front of the embassy of "Israel" in Washington, in protest against Palestinian genocide.
 </p>
<p>
  The Minas Gerais Committee on Solidarity to the Palestinian people continues to promote various activities, such as the collection of signatures demanding the breakdown of Brazilian state relations with “Israel” and prepares great unrest during the “freshman reception” at UFMG and the celebration of International Day of Working woman.

  On February 28, health workers from various categories mobilized a protest in front of the Federal Prosecutor (MPF). The workers denounced salary delays, persecution to workers and the complete chaos that is health in the state.
 </p>
<p>
  The activity was mobilized by the Todos for Health Movement in collaboration with the Amazonas Vigilantes Union. Nurses, doctors, vigilantes, machines, as well as workers from other sectors who went to support the mobilization, participated in the protest.
 </p>
<p>
  In different interventions, health professionals denounced the collusion of the State Government, the Chamber of Deputies and the press monopoly to hide the numerous problems of public health in Amazonas. Their speeches, the leaders of the movement highlighted the collusion of the State Government, the Chamber of Deputies and the media monopoly to make up and hide the numerous problems of public health in the Amazon. Protesters also point out that while the people died in hospitals' beds, the main concern of councilmen and deputies is the next edition of the electoral farce.

<p>
  The Military Police (PM), at the behest of the Federal District Government (GDF), invaded the Ahain Aam indigenous village, located in Paranoá, last February 29. The PMs threaten to overthrow the indigenous homes in the coming days.
 </p>
<p>
  The invasion was made in conjunction with Funai, MPI, and Terracap, with the "justification" that they had received a denunciation that there was no one living in the lands, who wanted to check if there were houses there, and if the residents really They were indigenous. The tone was soon changed in the course of the action, with the final promises of overthrowing the houses.

  The PMs also tried to get a negotiation around a withdrawal without confrontation. In it, all buildings, except one of the houses, would be overthrown by the government and residents would be forced to abandon the area. Other facilities would be confiscated indefinitely and taken to an alleged deposit.
 </p>
<p>
  The indigenous disputed the absurd decision. “We live here. I will deliver what I have and where am I going to sleep? ”Asks one of the leaders to government representatives. In video broadcast on social networks, you can see PMs laughing while promoting expulsion.

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Attacks on the village derive from real estate speculation
 </h4>
<p>
  Residents report that these attacks have been taking place since 23/02, when the PM first invaded the land to remove residents. At the time, the military spent the day at the scene and knocked down the house of one of the residents. The residence was empty on the spot because the resident, a pregnant woman, had gone with relatives.
 </p>
<p>
  According to supporters of the cause, these invasions from the GDF and the PM are linked to real estate speculation, as the attacks on the village began only after the construction of the Gardebra Gardebra condominium, near indigenous lands. They also report that sometimes they were land grabbers, carrying alleged ownership documents. The indigenous people refused to leave the gileiros attempts, and then the PM took over.

  In addition, on the same day of the visit on 29/02, the great entrepreneurs of the Gardebra Condominium had a meeting with the GDF. Residents and supporters of the village denounced that public servants left the direct meeting to the indigenous land.

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Indians criticize government
 </h4>
<p>
  In a support group of the indigenous cause in the DF, activists criticize the silence of alleged indigenous “leaders” as to what has been happening in Ahain Aam village.
 </p>
<p>
  In one of the messages, a member of the group republished a recent post by Sônia Guajajara celebrating the so-called “headdress bench” and commented “meanwhile, a few kilometers from the eviction [in Congress], just joy”, ironically referring to the situation of conflict lived by the indigenous people in the DF.
 </p>
<p>
  Another also says that “this is why they did not help [the Ahain Aam village]. They were very busy asking for money for the hit bench. ”

<p>
  The reactionary governor of Goiás, Ronaldo Caiado, inaugurated on February 28 the park “Am Israel Chai”. The pro-action initiative seeks to “honor” people who died on October 7, without any mention of the Palestinian people or even the Israelis who were killed by the Israeli army themselves, not by the Palestinian National Resistance. The action was answered by pro-Palestinian activists of the state, who collapsed hundreds of posters against the Zionist genocide near the Park.
 </p>
<p>
  The event was attended by Israeli ambassador Daniel Zonshine and notably reactionary parliamentarians, such as the eugenist federal deputy Gustavo Gayer, Rondoniense federal deputy Cristiane Lopes (União Brasil) and the reactionary delegate Waldir. Sadly, 1,200 olive trees will be planted in the park. The olive tree is a traditional tree of the Palestinian lands invaded by Israel.

<p>
  To consolidate the act of servilism to Zionism, Caiado has signed two agreements between Israel and the state of Goiás. One of them is a political agreement signed the commitment to “fight anti -Semitism”. In fact, it is the commitment of repression against pro-Palestinian organizations and personalities, persecuted throughout Brazil under the false allegation of anti-Semitism. The second is an economic agreement of technological “cooperation” in various areas, especially in agriculture, officializing Israeli participation in the Paranã span fruit project, where the Israeli ambassador had already made visits, including before October 2023. Project is a booming of the landlord (“agribusiness”) in the state, with coverage of rush against quilombola lands and repression of poor peasants in struggle for the land.
 </p>
<p>
  The agreement was also possible, because, despite the formal convictions of the federal government to the Zionist state of Israel, no concrete action to break relations with the Netanyahu regime was performed.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">

<p>
  The inauguration of the square was released a day earlier to avoid protests. But, the day before, members of the Palestinian people solidarity committee coined hundreds of pro-Palestinian posters near the place where the event would happen.

<p>
  In addition to denouncing genocide and demanding the end of the Zionist occupation, the posters also had in their content the denunciation of Caiado's cowardly sadism to take advantage of the pain and suffering of a war to make electoral political campaign.
 </p>
<p>
  On Wednesday night, social networks were taken by indignation against Caiado's new pro-legal monument.

<p>
  On February 16, an outsourced worker at the Class 10 School of Ceilândia, in the Federal District, fell from a height of approximately four meters when cleaning a awning at the entrance of the college. The worker did not use any safety equipment and was not trained for work.
 </p>
<p>
  A video of the accident released on social networks shows Sandra de Souza Marinho, 41, using a ladder to clean the awning with a water jet, and proves the lack of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).
 </p>
<p>
  After the accident, Sandra was taken to the Base Hospital, where she remained in serious condition. She died on 22/02, just before the doctors ended the confirmation protocol of the worker's brain death.

  The worker was employed by Real JG Facilitis. The company has been trying to get rid of responsibility by stating, to the G1 press monopoly, that Sandra was not trained for the service, that the PPE was compatible with the conservation function and who was the director who asked Sandra to clean the Roof, because "under no circumstances, she or other employees should do this kind of work, especially using a ladder." However, the hiring document of the company provided for the monthly cleaning of the gutters and the roof, still specifying the use of ladder with appropriate equipment provided by the contracted company.
 </p>
<p>
  Known from Sandra even commented on social networks that she was "a very hardworking and hardworking woman." They also stated that nothing takes the responsibility of the company "that submits cleaning employees to such services."
 </p>
<p>
  A netizen also commented on the platform

  who worked 7 years in the same company that provides service in DF schools, stating that "we are really obliged to do things that are not in the contract for fear of losing our job." And if questioning the person in charge, "he says he has to do what the management will send."

  Congressmen responsible for the “PEC of Armage”, which seeks to increase the privileges of legal protection to politicians, have returned to increase the project with the inclusion of an item that allows parliamentarians investigated by the court to access, unrestrictedly, inquiries against them themselves. The item allows even confidential protected sections to be accessed. The information was revealed by columnist D'O Globo, Malu Gaspar.
 </p>
<p>
  Parliamentarians also seek to prohibit search and seizure operations on congressional premises, define that the beginning of findings against deputies and senators only begin with the approval of Congress and end the privileged forum. As much as the end of the forum may seem like something progressive, the real reason for the deputies for the movement is to make the process start at the first instance, thus escaping the claws of the Supreme Court (STF). Currently, parliamentarians have the prerogative of, in cases involving the exercise of the car, to be tried directly by the Supreme.
 </p>
<p>
  Although PEC is supported by the various sectors of Parliament (governors, “centrão” and “opposition”), the main advances occurred concomitantly or after investigations against the far right, and particularly figures linked to Bolsonaro. This was how the project advanced after investigations authorized by Alexandre de Moraes against
  <a href="https://anovademocracia.com.br/holofotes-da-operacao-contra-deputado-bolsonarista-escondem-verdadeiros-culpados-do-golpismo/">
   Carlos Jordy (PL)
  </a>
  , leader of the far right in Campos dos Goytacazes, in RJ, and former ABIN chief,
  <a href="https://anovademocracia.com.br/abin-violou-a-integridade-nacional-com-espionagem-em-parceria-com-israel-recaira-sobre-ela-a-lei-do-estado-democratico-de-direito/">
   Alexandre Ramagem (PL)
  </a>
  .
 </p>
<p>
  The new additions are a sign that, in addition to seeking legal shielding in general, certain sectors seek, in particular, to continue to be associated with Bolsonaro with the certainty that they will not be affected.
 </p>
<p>
  “It cannot be confidential for the party, which cannot be processed without knowing what is being accused and without knowing the evidence. How can she defend herself? It is to comply with due process of law, the broad defense and the right to the contradictory ”, questioned União Brasil leader in the House, Elmar Nascimento (BA), according to the monopolistic newspaper O Globo.
 </p>

  Currently, investigators can only have access to sections of inquiry that affect them after performing search and seizure operations and material analysis. This is to prevent the investigated from knowing what is being produced against him, either through documents, allegations, evidence or even interceptions.
 </p>
<p>
  Lack of knowledge about the tests is important. This is precisely one of the issues that has made Bolsonaro's situation particularly sensitive in the legal scope. The far-right-made hard head does not know so far what Mauro Cid has revealed in his award-winning denunciation. Since February 23, Bolsonaro also doesn't know what General Estevam Theophilo spoke in his five -hour statement to the Federal Police. Of course, the former Mandanician's sniffs do not observe the situation without learning their own lessons.
 </p>
<p>
  All the new movement to increase the judicial shield of parliamentarians, including movements specifically planned to escape from the STF and Alexandre de Moraes (who has, by
  <a href="https://anovademocracia.com.br/agora-o-stf-vai-punir-os-golpistas/">
   own reasons for dispute and maintenance of the pocket of political power
  </a>
  , advanced against the far right scammers), indicates, above all, that Bolsonaro did not die politically, although weakened. Politicians of the so-called "opposition" and even "centrão" still want to use the far-right Bolsonarist to their own purposes, even for electoral calculation. It was still in the

  .
 </p>
<p>
  Nevertheless, they know it is a risky game, and that a poor movement can launch them in the frying pan with the boss. They are already preventively planning, therefore, the shield for the new approaches.

   From the beginning of the invasion, Russia has been willing to 
 pay especially high cost to advance in the east zone of 
 Ukraine known as Donbas, where Avdiivka is located. Parts of this 
 region traditionally Russian speaking have been occupied by representatives of 
 Russia since 2014, and when trying to justify the large -scale invasion, the 
 Kremlin has falsely affirmed that he is defending his Russian speakers, 
 saying they want to be part of Russia.

    Welcome to the Center for Strategic Studies and

 International Security. It has been two years since the Russians invaded 
 Ukraine.

    We are here to discuss a range of military issues, 
 Intelligence, political and other on the invasion, the state of the 
 war. And Eliot Cohen accompanies me. Eliot is the president of strategy of 
 Arleight Burke in CSIS, former counselor of the United States Department of State 
 and author of several books. Emily Harding, director of National Intelligence 
 Security and Technology Program, and Deputy Director of the International Institute

    But, most importantly, the author of the 
 Recently published memories, "By All Means Available" by Knopf, which 
 It was ... that it is a great book. Mike, thanks for doing that. And we had - 
 We have had a session about that as good. Let me start: if we could 
 Open the battlefield map. This is earlier this month. Us 
 We take out from the United Kingdom Ministry of Defense, Intelligence Defense. And the 
 What I wanted to do is remind everyone where we have come from. So you can't 
 See it on the map itself, but you visualize it after the initial attacks 
 Russians in at least five axes, did control the territory, some of the 
 which we can see here. They also tried to push down from 
 Belarus and parts of Russia to take kyiv, in what they failed. city ​​of 
 Járkov, which, as you can see, is not under Russian control, in which they failed. 
 Then we saw multiple phases in which the Ukrainians could effectively 
 Resume part of this territory, here in Kharkiv, with an offensive operation.

    Last year we saw the Russians resume territory, even in the south, in 
 Kherson. And where we are now they are a couple of things. We have recently 
 Seen the Russians to resume Avdiivka. I would say they are lit. The offensive. 
 They have military initiative at this time. They have not recovered much territory. We will talk 
 of the details in a moment. And we also have seen a lot of activity, the 
 Ukrainians point to Russian ships, infrastructure in Crimea and in the Black Sea 
 and its surroundings.

    You had a second phase, which was a counteroffensive

    This is a phase of positional war. I think it's a 
 Error to talk about it as a point of death, which is like some people talk about 
 it. This positional war seems quite familiar to historians 
 military where the initiative changes round trip, but where there is a lot 
 adaptation and innovation and change with the initiative going and coming.

    There is a deep campaign of attacks in the

    So, if we can open the map 
 Again, I want to concentrate a little, I want to stay on this subject and 
 Ask Mike and Emily, looking at the map I want to perfect here. 
 Some of the most recent activities we have seen are here in Avdiivka, 
 that the Russians have resumed at a big cost, we are listening to figures from 
 Victims, with a grain of salt, from more than 15,000 to 17,000. The Russian casualties, which 
 They are huge if that is true.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 21.0pt; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span>
<span>
    And then Emily, I mean, what is you 
 General opinion about the important or what success has this had for the Russians? 
 I mean, some people have done a big thing about this. than the Russians 
 They are now offensive. They have Avdiivka resumed. But what is you 
 sense?

<span>
    Well, the Russians are investigating in 
 five addresses along this line and Avdiivka, I think they had 
 symbolic importance for Putin before your choice because basically, no 
 He had taken anything in a year from Bakhmut.

    I think what Mike says about a 
 Little Ukrainian garrison that resists is absolutely true. There were some 
 sad numbers around 800 to a thousand. Ukrainian troops that could have 
 been captured when they tried to withdraw back and I think there are many criticisms 
 Really unfair to the way the Ukrainians backed away.

    It was relatively slow. We evaluate between 
 On June 4 and August 28, 2023, they got about 90 meters per day,

    I would start saying that it is really 
 A misinterpretation of what happened in World War I. You already know, 
 We, our mental image of World War I comes from an amount

 trench,
    <o:p>

<span>
<span>
    Actually, World War I 
 It was a very interactive war in which both sides are innovating the whole 
 time. It was a positional war. And then what happens? And this can be 
 A little misleading. You know, armies do not move at their average rhythm 
 Advance. What happens is that they are slugging, slugging, slugging, and then, boom, there are 
 A great advance and everything suddenly is going very deep.

<span>
<span>
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">
</span>
    This is like German offensives in 1918. 
 It is true for many wars. Even as the first Gulf War, there are, 
 You know, 40 days of bombing and then, suddenly, the war opens 
 land.

    I think the other way in which the 
 World War I analogy is misleading - and again, it is because the 
 people do not know the story, the reality type of tactical and operational history 
 of World War I - is the assumption. This is simply a 
 butcher shop and there are many casualties. I do not want to minimize that - and it is absurd and there is no, 
 You know, no particular innovation. Actually, this is a war in the 
 That there is a lot of innovation, in which, I would say it in this way. I think the 
 Ukrainians innovate from the bottom to top and the Russians tend to innovate 
 from top to bottom. The Russians have a very vertical command system, by

    Ukrainians are a free society, 
 So there are many boys with interesting ideas that come out and try things and experiment. 
 Both ways to do so have their advantages and disadvantages. But what 
 It is certainly not, a, it is not static; And B, it is not a conflict in which only

    So Mike, have you seen big 
 surprises so far? Honorable. Vickers: First, let me agree 
 with Eliot about the deceitful parallels of World War I. An area 
 Where I think there is a bit of similarity is that it also has attributes of a 
 war of relative industrial capacity and the ability to permanent 
 Societies until you get the advances that Eliot spoke and continuous innovation.

<span>
    So the big surprises are 
 simple. There are really two.
    <o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 21.0pt; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;">

 This position war, Eliot spoke. AND

    You know, wear fight, have 
 suffered much greater losses and simply, you know, I have not had a good 
 Performance from a military perspective. He
    <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">
</span>
    another side of the situation is the good that 
 The Ukrainians have done. Not only in defending its territory from the 
 beginning, but then recovering it. And Járkov and Kherson, as Eliot mentioned, and 
 Some of the innovations. You know, for a military without army, sinking 
 Much of the Black Sea fleet, taking part in the fight in 
 Russian territory also last week. Disadruido, you already know, seven airplanes 
 Russians That has gone very well. I wish there would be bigger surprises. There are two in 
 particular I have in mind. First, if I could go back the clock that 
 The United States did not chase. an incremental strategy. I think the Ukrainians 
 They would be much better if we had been bolder from the beginning.

 It is a good transition for Emily. How would you value the American spare, 
 including debates in Congress? And in fact, before your answer, only 
 I want to mention something that the United States has provided so far. 
 Then we can go to the maps. Around 2 million bullets of 155

 I think, without charity, you could say that we have been to play while Rome

    There is a cube

 constant convincing ourselves that if we provide the next system 
 or additional capacity, so that will be what leans to Russia to expand 
 the conflict. It simply has not happened. Russia as interested as us 
 in maintaining this restricted to Ukraine. And the more that we allow them to follow 
 advancing without retreating, the most will press. Russia is a thug. They respond

 The types of weapons you need in a fight in the Pacific are very different 
 that the weapons that are needed in a fight in Ukraine. In addition, we have just seen 
 Japan takes a step forward and agrees to provide Ukraine all kinds of help. AND 
 As they pointed out in the press this morning, they share a common neighbor. So much Japan

    My old 
 Chief Mike Vickers also said that. (Laugh.) I want to return to a point, Emily, 
 what you did - you raised the perspective of other countries, including some of 
 Our adversaries. I think people can forget or not realize that 
 When it comes to the Russians, you know, the Russians have also spent 
 Significant amounts of ammunition in this war too. So, the 
 Ask, in part - and that goes through drones and - where do they get help 
 the Russians? And for those who want to focus or think we can 
 focus (the United States can only focus on one theater at the same time, so 
 that we should really focus on Taiwan, or even only Israel, or - and what 
 We cannot do that, the reality when you look cooperation is that the Chinese 
 They have provided significant help to the Russians. And it has been in all 
 Areas, not in wholesale weapons systems. But a range of technology for 
 Russian weapons systems that include everything from microchips for systems 
 Weapons to pieces for ammunition.
    <o:p>
</o:p>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span>
<span>
    The 
 North Koreans have provided rockets and ammunition to the Russians. The Iranians have 
 provided the Shahed-136 and other drones. Then we are seeing the Russians receiving a variety of help 
 of the Chinese, of the North Koreans and the Iranians, which makes states 
 United retains your help at this time is surprising because we have not seen

    Also 
 I wanted to understand your opinion, Emily, about Europeans and where are the 
 Europeans when providing help to Ukraine. There are also - it has also been 
 Talking that Germans would provide taurus, for example, that it is a 
 greater scope ammunition. what is your sense of where the Europeans are and 
 How useful have they been when providing help to Ukraine? And then

 But there has to be a lot of political energy put in it. AND 
 Unfortunately I don't see that.

    So, returning to its European point, yes, it is 
 important to spend more on the Ministry of Defense. That 2 percent threshold 
 In a certain sense, it simply highlights that. But at the end of the day, I think 
 It is also important how they are spending their money. So, if we can achieve 
 this. I'm going to go with Mike in a second with a question. But if we could show 
 The image here. I just want the 
 people see here. This is one of the Iranian drones, the Shahed. 136. This was 
 Disabled in kyiv, and is now in possession of Ukrainians. You can also see 
 Here it is an Iranian drone. And here this Iranian flag is on the side. 
 So this gives us an idea of some of the other countries that have been 
 providing assistance to the Russians.

<p class="MsoNormal">
<span>
<span>
    What me 
 Take, Mike, the Russians. That is, its Russian military evaluation. You already spoke a 
 Little about this, but what do you have? Well done, in your sense? Where has you fought? 
 And are we seeing some? Evolution of the Russian concept of operations? They used 
 more air than had in the past in the offensive of Avdiivka. What does it mean 
 that?

    So, 
 Where the Russians have done the best they can really be in this position of position 
 where they have had an artillery advantage and an advantage. AND 
 then those two things - and, in addition, the nine months, essentially, they were given 
 To dig, prepare, put mined fields and other things that made the 
 Ukrainian summer offensive last year was very problematic. That, and the 
 lack of aerial power of the Ukrainians. You know, we essentially ask 
 Ukrainians to fight a war in a way that the US army 
 or the Western military would never do it. And you know, you just can't 
 win that way. That is, it is military negligence.
    <o:p>
</o:p>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span>
<span>
    So there 
 It is where they have done better. They have done the worst they have been able to in the field 
 Integrated combined weapons operations, airborne operations. AND 
 This is something we have seen with the Russian army in the Russian-Georgian war. 
 They thought they had plans to fix these things, you know, of the 
 learned lessons. They have not really done a good job. And you know, if everything 
 There seems to be worsened as the scale has increased. I mean, your 
 Great advantage at this time is really in resources. And it may be 
 more fragile than people think.

    Look at this 
 It is ... this was last year. But we can see some of the Russian fighting of 
 positions. The trenches that raised here, the dragon's teeth. These 
 They are multiple rows of dragon teeth. You can't see it here because it is 
 buried, but the mined fields, the anti -tanks that have used, the 
 Mortar site and weapons locations they have had. They had 
 time during last year's offensive to strengthen some of these 
 defenses measures. What about Russian air?

    Yes, the air 
 Russian, you know, it has been based mainly on missiles and aerial vehicles 
 Bened for strategic attack against populated centers. You know, and 
 He certainly had some success in that. In terms of air power in the field of 
 Battle, during the Ukrainian offensive they used attack helicopters reasonably 
 Good to limit Ukrainian penetrations. Fixed wing airplanes have not 
 done a lot. You know played a role in Avdiivka towards the end, when the 
 Ukrainian army was withdrawing under pressure -

 superior. A little different from our approach.

    This is one of those self -complicated prophecies of 
 those that spoke at the beginning. What is the message that Russians want 
 Let's absorb? that Ukraine cannot win, so we should withdraw the support. 
 And that idea that this is going to be totally self -fulfilled, which once we accept 
 The Russian policy of line then we go back, which makes it true, I think that 
 It is what we have to protect at all costs.

    Well, 
 Emily, the Russians have also been active in many other areas. We have seen 
 Navalny face death. We have seen a Ukrainian deserter probably 
 Killed in Spain. What else do you have? I mean, what are you doing with what they are 
 doing the Russians now in various fields?

    I mean, they get paid in a way that 
 It seems quite surprising. What is clear: Navalny did not fall dead because 
 own will in a Russian prison. I know in my bones as sure as 
 I'm sitting here, and I didn't even have to do it. Be on the floor with him. 
 We will discover it at some point in the future that was in fact killed, and it was 
 Killed at a certain time for a certain reason. The fact that Putin 
 It has allowed it just before Munich the conference is quite interesting. 
 That came out almost at the same time that some news arose about some 
 New Russian capabilities potentially being in space, I think it is very 
 interesting.

  This Sunday, February 25, the Cause du Peuple Hixo a call to commemorate the heroes of the proletariat of France. As every year, this commemorative act was aimed at honoring Pierre Overney, a revolutionary worker, seller of Cause Du Peuple. On February 25, 1972, while Pierrot crossed the hard experience of forced unemployment, dismissed from Renault for political reasons, participated in a brochure distribution action in front of the factory to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the massacre of the Charonne subway, a Demonstration that followed the massacre of October 17, 1961, in which the French police suffocated in mass to Algerians. After his death, class solidarity was immense and more than 200,000 people walked in a long procession behind their coffin at the beginning of March 1972.
 </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-46bb36557b443ba42ebf8efac7360039">
  We also pay a special tribute to the heroes of the Manouchian Group (FTP-MOI), who gave their lives for the Communist Party and the Revolution 80 years ago. In addition to a speech, two letters were read to the comrades present. The first is composed of extracts from Missak Manouchian letter to Mélinée, his wife, before his death. She demonstrates all her internationalism and heroism. The second is a letter from the Bulgarian worker Lutibrodsky, sentenced to death by the dictatorship in 1934, to his father. This letter was distributed with thousands of copies at the time as an example of the incessant struggle against bourgeoisie and fascism. The demonstration, which started from the Père Lachaise subway station, went through Pierrot's tomb, then through Szlama Grzywacz, communist fighter, Polish Jew and a member of the Manuchian group, shot on February 21, 1944.

  We publish photographs of the event here, which attracted the attention and sympathy of passers -by and the employees of the Père Lachaise [Translator Note: Cemetery of Paris], mobilizing numerous followers of our newspaper. Very soon we will publish the speech and letters that were read on this occasion.

<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  It is difficult to do the counter -information and speak, for example, of the 
 massacre of Gaza without feeling the sense of weakness, impotence, 
 compared to what it would be necessary to do.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Let's start from 
 facts. Yesterday he shot himself on the "crowd of hungry", like 
 They write the newspapers, you shoot on those looking for bread. The ambulances not 
 They were enough. Many bodies of deaths and injured were loaded on 
 carts pulled by donkeys, others on the few cars available, others 
 still on the trailers of the trucks that had brought the aid 
 humanitarian.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The shooting is 
 was indiscriminate. Israeli soldiers shot in the head, 
 to the legs, to the abdomen. A massacre, a massacre without alibi. A 
 massacre on the Palestinian masses that the Nazi Zionist state 
 of Israel and his soldiers are trained to consider "animals" 
 with human features. So they are seen and therefore it can be shot 
 As in a hunting trip.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  No one knows 
 really how many Palestinians were killed. A first figure 
 It speaks of 114 and is a reduction figure. Many are in conditions 
 serious, transported where it was possible, taking into account that in the 
 Strip of Gaza there are no hospitals in operation, they are without 
 Everything and therefore even part of the injured are certainly at risk 
 life.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  He shot himself 
 on humanitarian aid, that is, it has fired not only on the Palestinians 
 But on all those who help them sending food, clothing - to which 
 It also appeals from the television screens -many 
 of which they are "beautiful souls" who want to put the 
 consciousness and send humanitarian aid.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Israel has 
 shot on humanitarian aid, he shot you who are solidarity, to you 
 that you do not share what is happening, that does not share the 
 genocide, which does not share the absolute impunity that this state has 
 Compared to fundamental laws, human rights, resolutions 
 UN, even to the laws of war. An out of law since 
 birth, in its constitution, which is believed to be in a position to do 
 all above and outside the law.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Of all this 
 This massacre is a page and it is not even the final page.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  It's a 
 massacre that comes from a thousand and a thousand actions of this type, from 
 a 75 -year -old employment that produced, phase in phase, massacres of 
 This type and horrors of this type. And therefore this ongoing war 
 Against the Palestinian people it is the summa, the recapitulation of all 
 wars, it is like the world war that comes now: the 
 recapitulation of all wars that never end there are 
 in the world.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  That's why a 
 A massacre without limits, to a warless war, is not possible 
 that the oppressed have limits to all their action, like the heroic action 
 of the Palestinian resistance of 7 October and those who will come - 
 because they will come, those who sow wind collect storm - and those who 
 they will come can have no limits because they fight a war without 
 limits to trace a possible war "with the limits", because 
 The conflict between imperialism and oppressed peoples will not stop today 
 nor tomorrow and we will carry it with you for years, in history 
 of humanity.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Of course, everyone 
 We would like "the abolition of wars", of all wars. But today, here and now, we have to stop a war 
 genocida, support those who resist you that necessarily have to do the 
 His counter -cingle of people.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Stop the regime 
 Israeli is the interest of all the peoples of the world and certainly not only for "solidarity with Palestine" but because it is a 
 outbreak of infection within a general trend to war that 
 It is up to stages all the territories. And this concerns everyone and in ours 
 country concerns us. It concerns us as masses, it concerns us as 
 proletarians, it concerns us as always engaged in the struggle for 
 oppressed against the oppressors, in our country as in other parts 
 of the world.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  At the 
 recapitulation of all oppressions must be answered with the 
 struggle to eliminate the evil that produces them: the imperialist system e 
 capitalist who periodically produces the monsters that embody it e 
 show the barbarism inherent in the nature of this system and, in 
 our country, the Meloni government. But the Meloni government is the last 
 arrived, even if, as always, the latest arrival tries to overcome 
 Every limit of the previous ones and therefore it is worse.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The latest arrival is an accomplice.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  In the same 
 Page of the manifesto where there is a minor article about the massacre 
 He says: “Investigation of other Economy. Italy has continued to arm 
 Tel Aviv ". Other Economy made an investigation not on weapons that 
 receives Israel - Israel has always received weapons from all countries 
 imperialists, with the arms merchants par excellence in the lead, it 
 State-war which is American imperialism and all the various 
 European imperialist countries, the war industries - behind each 
 war are profits and war is a great business, not 
 Of course, a horror is a great business of the weapons markets. This investigation 
 It concerns the period after October 7th. Other Economy did not go to 
 Discover the secret cards in the archives of the war industry or in 
 those of the Ministry of the Interior. No, he consulted Istat. What 
 that each of us could do.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Despite what the 
 Minister Crossetto, an obsceone grassone, shop assistant on books 
 pay the war industry, one of the horrors, of the small monsters, 
 in the cage of monsters that our country has given birth to the 
 Meloni government:
  <b>
   “Between October and 
 November Italy exported weapons and ammunition to Israel for a 
 value of 817,536 euros. 233,025 in October, 584,511 in November "
  </b>
  . 
 This is the Istat.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  We know how in 
 Italy were the struggles of the port and also the initiatives that 
 invite to boycott, to suspend the supply of weapons ad 
 Israel, from the ports of Genoa, as well as from the last 
 manifestation last Saturday in Palermo which had as its objective e 
 Leonardo final headquarters. And other things happened for the work of 
 All of us, where the "us" here is for the us who supports 
 truly the solidarity struggle with Palestine and the campaign of 
 boycott, "those of Milan" last week between 23 and 24 February, 100,000, mostly workers 
 belonging to basic trade union organizations and groups 
 Communists, progressive and revolutionaries, who were in the square on Saturday.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Also the network 
 Italian for peace and disarmament denounces all this, indeed 
 demonstrate how the law can be circumvented to evade controls, 
 To legalize post Faestum the sending of weapons, the trade of weapons 
 And in this case the sending of weapons to Israel.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  So say that 
 The government is complicit is little. He is the protagonist, he is an accomplice, he is in 
 a second row, not that he shot against the Palestinians a 
 Gaza - this could be an exaggeration - but surely the 
 Italian government, the Italian war industry, are part of this 
 system and of this armament of Israel that produces the massacre of 
 Yesterday, the massacres from October onwards. And future massacres, because it is 
 clear: if you don't stop them, after what we saw yesterday in the 
 shooting on the hungry, we will see worse.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Cease-fire, 
 stop the genocide ……. But here it is a question of a part of a 
 war, of the war between oppressed and oppressors, between justice, 
 freedom, self -determination of peoples, a whole series of things that 
 they would be sanctioned by the UN card, by the Italian Constitution, 
 from the principles of the Church even (with all the hypocrisy with which we can 
 say these words).
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Well, everything 
 This is reduced to stroke paper by the Zionist state of Israel 
 And we need to shout it strong and clear and that we use in depth the 
 weapons of critics. But let's consider that to stop the 
 ferocious beast, activated by the general climate and the situation 
 General World Cup, the weapons of criticism must give way to the criticism of weapons. Peoples who want peace and justice 
 And they don't want to live under this oppression they will have to overturn 
 necessarily with weapons governments, the states that produce everything 
 this, as part of the gigantic struggle for a different destiny 
 of humanity.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This is up to 
 everyone. And even if you believe yourself, you are all involved.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  And this war is 
 the war that can allow the improvement of the situation of the 
 world, the war of people can put an end 
 Endless horror.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The War of People in Palestine. The war of 
 people of the oppressed against imperialism. The war of people in 
 our country, against our government. The new resistance 
 In the interest not only of the future of Italy but of Palestine, 
 of the world…..

<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The violent police charges, in particular against the students 
 of Pisa who manifested for Palestine on the occasion of the 
 Day of the General Strike of 23 February called for 
 Basic unions - but remember that the police also attacked i 
 parades in Florence, in Catania - immediately aroused throughout the 
 country on the one hand a great indignation at the mass level e 
 on the other a great more than just solidarity that is immediately 
 given the same evening in Pisa, when thousands of people, of young people, 
 of students, workers, women, have actually invaded, in 
 Solidarity protest, the Piazza dei Cavalieri, that same square that 
 In the morning, to the sound of Manganello, the policemen had prevented the 
 students to reach, an event that has also expressed itself 
 As part of the great event that has been there 
 In the aftermath, on February 24 in Milan for Palestine and which is 
 continued to date with multiple initiatives that have been there 
 In schools, in the university, with banners, signs, assemblies 
 of the students, also took positions of the teachers, of the workers, 
 in the more than right occupations that the students are doing (ad 
 example in Milan 5 high schools were occupied in 
 these days).
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  So solidarity continues.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  In this picture 
 The President of the Republic, Mattarella, was in fact 
 obliged to take a position by talking about "bankruptcy", 
 referring to the batons used against students who have the 
 right to manifest and express their thoughts according to that 
 which is the constitution still in force in this country. President 
 of the Republic then called the Minister planted to the Order 
 because he reported on what happened.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But on the contrary, 
 by the government, starting with Meloni to continue with the 
 various ministers, from Salvini to the same planted that yesterday spoke 
 to the rooms, instead the attitude was quite the opposite: from a 
 Absolutely arrogant silence of Meloni until a few days 
 Fa, who then, as part of an interview that made to 
 Rai tender tender, to a journalist's question about 
 These events immediately took a position in defense of the police, 
 saying that it absolutely does not have to be criminalized, and 
 on the other hand he made what his is out once again 
 fascist nature, ideological, political, but also in general of 
 government of which he is at the head, when he says that in this country anyway 
 Nobody prevents us from manifesting and indeed Italy is a country in which 
 It is still allowed to show for Palestine when there are instead 
 countries where it is no longer allowed, as if to say that if there is it to date 
 It was the events for Palestine is because we - 
 government- we allowed you, but we could also decide not to 
 make you more manifest for this.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  So even one 
 sort of fascist threat. And it is no coincidence that the proposal of 
 law that Salvini's League has already presented, aimed at preventing the 
 de facto events for Palestine, exploiting the 
 question of antisionism, it is certainly a step forward, a 
 forward piece of this march that the government wants to put in 
 Acts, as all the spaces is increasingly narrowing more 
 democrats and increasingly imposing a police state, of which 
 One of the very serious events was precisely what it is 
 Success in Pisa.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  On the other hand, there was also the arrogant contempt for the demonstrators, of 
 students violently attached by the police, who expressed the same planted when he reported to yesterday's rooms, 
 confirming the reactionary and fascist nature of this government, 
 saying on the one hand also cracks, then bales, as we said 
 Other times in these counter -information - and to say balle is 
 just a trademark of this government, starting with the 
 Garbatella Meloni fascistella - but above all by moving 
 constantly attention from the boys eaten in an unprecedented way, 
 As the teachers themselves said who lived live 
 to police offices, to criminalize them and to defend 
 Instead a police who "would be constantly attached to this 
 village".
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The minister has 
 Said: “allow me to underline the right of members 
 to the police forces not to suffer summary processes. They are workers 
 who deserve the utmost respect. The management of public order is 
 a daily commitment, delicate and not without risk, carried out with the 
 Maximum dedication from women and men in uniform ".
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  And here it would be there 
 immediately to say that this management of the public order “carried out with 
 dedication ”, in reality then it is totally erased when in Rome, 
 As happened two evenings ago, a new gathering is made of 
 fascists who praise fascism with Roman greetings, protected by 
 Cordoni of the police and nobody denounces them, nobody there 
 Manganella, nobody prevents him from manifesting. And these would be 
 precisely the workers who deserve the utmost respect and that 
 they would carry out their work with the "maximum dedication", having 
 sworn on a constitution that prohibits the apology of fascism?
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Still 
 Planted: “There is still an atmosphere of growing aggression in 
 comparisons of the police who aim to raise the 
 level of contrast between the square and the institutions ".
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  And who would have 
 This purpose?
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Planted not 
 He naturally says. And therefore either it is a crack, a bale, or it would go 
 at least investigated for silence.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  In its 
 information to the de facto rooms then constantly accused the 
 students who would not have respected the law, who would violate 
 the law in Pisa because no notice had been submitted to the 
 preccint. The minister says. “The risk of violence is zero 
 If the demonstrators do not implement dangerous behaviors ". 
 So plane is to understand that young students 
 Manganellati who protested against the genocide in place in 
 Palestine would have implemented dangerous behavior and that 
 So if they would seek it.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But not only. 
 Also they had to be eaten because the policemen who were the ones who 
 They had to save themselves when planted says that: “To guarantee 
 the safety of police operators, compressed against 
 the vehicle connected behind them, a charge was carried out 
 lightening, allowing staff to advance some 
 meter and thus loosen the pressure of the demonstrators ".
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  And after these 
 shameful words has the courage to say that the government does not have 
 However, no intention to repress dissent!
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But we remain on the accusation of not having notified the event e 
 We respond with the words of the Constitutionalist Zagrebelsky who in 
 An interview with the newspaper La Repubblica describes exactly the 
 procedure prescribed by article 17 of the Italian Constitution in 
 thanks to the public manifestations that says yes, those 
 events must be notified at least three days earlier, but 
 not "authorized" but only "communicated" because the authorities can have the 
 time to organize what you need to keep without 
 obstacles. Second, if there was no notice, then 
 possibly only those who organize could be reported and not 
 all those who participate and less than being beaten, 
 Manganellati, as happened to the students in Pisa.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  What 
 Planted does not say it is that it is not written anywhere that who 
 protest without having warned must be eaten, 
 using in fact in an absolutely shameful way e 
 instrumental, just as Meloni or Salvini also did, the use of 
 two countries and two measures when it comes to fascist rallies or when yes 
 safeguard sectors in protest, which, however, are included for example 
 in the Meloni electorate, who are neither eaten nor 
 reported, nothing of this kind.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  So all the 
 speech of planted is impregnated by the ideological conception e 
 Police state policy of this fascist government, e 
 that is, that it can only be manifested if the state - that is, this government 
 And that is the police, the repressive apparatus in the service of this 
 Government - allows it. And this is also the substance of the speech that 
 Meloni did in the interview with some evenings ago.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This 
 Of course it is a clear manifestation of modern fascism that 
 advances in this country by this government which represents the 
 more reactionary part of the bourgeoisie in power.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  And therefore in front 
 To all this we can only continue the constant complaint in 
 each area, in every place, in every initiative, in every struggle e 
 on the other hand, continue to demonstrate, to mobilize us, as is it 
 happening in these days in this country and this is, 
 Of course, all positive.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Organize and build that unit of action that is more and more 
 necessary to fight against modern fascism that the bourgeoisie 
 dominant wants to impose in every area.

  The newspaper AND
  <a href="https://anovademocracia.com.br/policiais-assassinam-7-pessoas-invadem-casas-e-proibem-circulacao-de-moradores-durante-megaoperacao-em-3-complexos-no-rio/">
   has reported
  </a>
  on a new police mega-operation and a new massacre committed by the repressive forces in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro. On this occasion, the old Brazilian State lead by the PT of Luiz Inácio da Silva has murdered 9 people. This occurred in the areas of Alemão and Penha, in the northern area of Rio.
 </p>
<p>
  The broadcast “A Propósito” from AND, has made a chapter entirely dedicated to this mega-operation, going in detail through this kind of operations in the favelas and interviewing a neighbor from the complex of Alemão.

  The repressive mega-operations in the favelas of Rio are frequent, and some months ago,
  <a href="https://redherald.org/2023/09/30/brazil-new-military-operation-against-the-people-in-complexo-da-mare/">
   we already reported
  </a>
  on a big operation and a massacre that occurred in the Complexo da Maré, also in the north of Rio.
 </p>
<p>
  Including this new massacre, the governor of Rio, Cláudio Castro, is responsible of three of the five biggest massacres committed in the history of Rio. As is usual, the old Brazilian State has mobilized a big number of troops, highly militarized, including armored military vehicles, military police and the infamous Special Operations Battalion (Bope), well-known for its uncountable crimes and massacres committed against the people. Also participating was the Actions with Dogs Battalion (BAC), which is also a special force belonging to the MP.
 </p>
<p>
  In addition to the murders carried out and the eviction of neighbors’ houses that have been used as military posts by the repressive forces, there have been many other bad consequences for the inhabitants of the favelas: many schools have been closed, leaving more than 20.000 students without classes; businesses of the favela have been closed; additionally many family medical services have been closed, leaving thousands of people without medical care; even public transport has been suspended, leaving at least 130.000 people without buses. AND reports that during the 27
  <sup>
   th
  </sup>
  even the power service has been cut off due to damage to the electrical infrastructure, and the large supplier company, Light, has left the neighbors without security of being able to have power.
 </p>
<p>
  Below we share a video provided by AND that shows how the repressive forces took the houses of neighbors and used them to shoot at the residents of the favelas.

<p>
  This type of crimes against the people has been frequent during the history of the old Brazilian State. As AND denounces, for years there have been mega-operations in the favelas and many massacres, which on many occasions have resulted in many murders. Another consequence of these criminal actions has been the protests and revolts of the people. AND reports that motorcycle taxi drivers in the Alemão complex are planning a protest against the massacre, and also the climate of rebellion may spread to other favelas. So far this year there have also been protests previously in Maré and in Manguinhos.
 </p>
<p>
  These massacres have also been common in recent years and even the bourgeois press of the imperialist countries has reported on them,
  <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/11/rio-deadliest-police-raid-favela-drugs-protest?emci=822974ee-52b2-eb11-85aa-0050f237abef&amp;emdi=903de8ee-53b2-eb11-85aa-0050f237abef&amp;ceid=4606001">
   for example after one of the largest massacres in Rio de Janeiro in 2021
  </a>
  , in which the attitude of the repressive forces unleashed the alarms, and that part of the bourgeois press took advantage of it to link this massacre with Bolsonaro to denounce it as something particular of his government. The reality is that with the new PT’s government, led by Luiz Inácio da Silva, this trend has not been different. As
  <a href="https://redherald.org/2023/08/06/and-a-democracy-of-massacres-opportunism-keeps-silence-in-front-of-the-massacres/">
   AND denounced
  </a>
  in one of its weekly editorials, this is a true reactionary civil war and that in Brazil
  <em>
   “with or without Bolsonarism, we live in a true dictatorship for the popular masses, while democracy prevails only in small palaces.”
  </em>

   admitted
  </a>
  that more than 25.000 women and children have been killed in Gaza by Israel since October 7.
 </p>
<p>
  On Thursday the 29
  <sup>
   th
  </sup>
  of February the State of Israel committed an especially cynical act. At least 112 Palestinians who were waiting for aid were
  <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/1/flour-massacre-how-gaza-food-killings-unfolded-and-israels-story-changed">
   massacred
  </a>
  by the IDF. More than 750 people were wounded. Thousands of people, in desperate need of food, water and medicine, gathered early in the morning waiting at Harun al-Rashid Street, in northern Gaza, where aid trucks carrying flour were believed to be on the way. When the trucks arrived the IDF started shooting the gathered civilians with all kinds of military equipment. When people returned to the trucks after the first round of fire ended, the Israelis opened fire again. A journalist on the scene reported that “after opening fire, Israeli tanks advanced and ran over many of the dead and injured bodies”.
 </p>
<p>
  A witness describes what happened: “We had come here to get our hands on some aid. I have waiting since noon yesterday. At about 4:30 in the early morning trucks started to trickle in. The Israelis just opened random fire on us as if it was a trap. Once we approached the aid trucks, the Israeli tanks and warplanes started firing on us”. Another person at the scene said: “We were going to bring flour … then Israeli snipers shot at us”.
 </p>
<p>
  The IDF at first tried to blame the victims by saying that most of the deaths resulted from the panicked people trampling each other when the trucks arrived. Witnesses describe that this happened only after the Israeli soldiers opened fire. The IDF later changed their story and claimed that they opened fire because the gathered people were a threat to them.

<p>
  On the 28
  <sup>
   th
  </sup>
  of February there was a general strike and mass protests in Greece, led mainly by yellow unions such as the PAME of the revisionist KKE. We have received reports via email.
 </p>
<p>
  28
  <sup>
   th
  </sup>
  of February marks the 1-year anniversary of the murder of 57 people at the tempi train crash which was caused by the non-existent safety measures of the Greek state. The state chose profit over the lives of its own people. No measures have been taken to punish those who are responsible for the massacre nor have any reforms happened to make sure such a thing never happens again. The strike other than demanding action for the massacre, has made demands such as increases in wages, an end to support of Israel by the Greek state and opposition to the privatization of Greek universities. One of the points of interests of this event is that the GSEE trade union formation opposed the strike, once again showing that it is nothing more than a tool of the bosses. The main participants where the ADEDY (Confederation of Greek Civil Servants’ Trade Unions), the leadership of which is made up of ND, SYRIZA, PASOK, KKE and ANTARSYA and PAME (all-workers militant front), the trade union wing of the KKE. All the oppressed of society, workers, students and peasants came together to show their class hatred and disappointment of the government. The unprecedented participation in this strike shows the rotten nature of the reactionary Greek state, which is nothing more than a puppet of Yankee imperialism.

  Partizan Greece has also reported on the general strike:
