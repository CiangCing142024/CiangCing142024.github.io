The pro-action initiative seeks to \u201chonor\u201d people who died on October 7, without any mention of the Palestinian people or even the Israelis who were killed by the Israeli army themselves, not by the Palestinian National Resistance. The action was answered by pro-Palestinian activists of the state, who collapsed hundreds of posters against the Zionist genocide near the Park.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The event was attended by Israeli ambassador Daniel Zonshine and notably reactionary parliamentarians, such as the eugenist federal deputy Gustavo Gayer, Rondoniense federal deputy Cristiane Lopes (Uni\u00e3o Brasil) and the reactionary delegate Waldir. Sadly, 1,200 olive trees will be planted in the park. The olive tree is a traditional tree of the Palestinian lands invaded by Israel.\n </p>\n <div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n  <figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\">\n   <img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-170237\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"665\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" src=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG-20240228-WA0080-1024x665.jpg\" srcset=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG-20240228-WA0080-1024x665.jpg\" width=\"1024\"/>\n   <figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">\n    Caiado inaugurates park in honor of Israel.

One of them is a political agreement signed the commitment to \u201cfight anti -Semitism\u201d. In fact, it is the commitment of repression against pro-Palestinian organizations and personalities, persecuted throughout Brazil under the false allegation of anti-Semitism. The second is an economic agreement of technological \u201ccooperation\u201d in various areas, especially in agriculture, officializing Israeli participation in the Paran\u00e3 span fruit project, where the Israeli ambassador had already made visits, including before October 2023. Project is a booming of the landlord (\u201cagribusiness\u201d) in the state, with coverage of rush against quilombola lands and repression of poor peasants in struggle for the land.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The agreement was also possible, because, despite the formal convictions of the federal government to the Zionist state of Israel, no concrete action to break relations with the Netanyahu regime was performed.\n </p>\n <h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\n  Prompt answer\n </h4>\n <p>\n  The inauguration of the square was released a day earlier to avoid protests. But, the day before, members of the Palestinian people solidarity committee coined hundreds of pro-Palestinian posters near the place where the event would happen.\n </p>\n <figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\">\n  <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">\n   <img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-170242\" data-id=\"170242\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"939\" sizes=\"(max-width: 776px) 100vw, 776px\" src=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG-20240228-WA0017.jpg\" srcset=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG-20240228-WA0017.jpg\" width=\"776\"/>\n   <figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">\n    Photo: Database and\n   </figcaption>\n  </figure>\n  <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">\n   <img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-170240\" data-id=\"170240\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1024\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" src=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG-20240228-WA0021-768x1024.jpg\" srcset=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG-20240228-WA0021-768x1024.jpg\" width=\"768\"/>\n   <figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">\n    Photo: Database and\n   </figcaption>\n  </figure>\n  <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">\n   <img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-170239\" data-id=\"170239\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1007\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 695px) 100vw, 695px\" src=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG-20240228-WA0019.jpg\" srcset=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG-20240228-WA0019.jpg\" width=\"695\"/>\n   <figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">\n    Photo: Database and\n   </figcaption>\n  </figure>\n  <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">\n   <img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-170238\" data-id=\"170238\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1024\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" src=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG-20240228-WA0018-768x1024.jpg\" srcset=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG-20240228-WA0018-768x1024.jpg\" width=\"768\"/>\n   <figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">\n    Photo: Database and\n   </figcaption>\n  </figure>\n </figure>\n <p>\n  In addition to denouncing genocide and demanding the end of the Zionist occupation, the posters also had in their content the denunciation of Caiado's cowardly sadism to take advantage of the pain and suffering of a war to make electoral political campaign.\n </p>\n <p>\n  On Wednesday night, social networks were taken by indignation against Caiado's new pro-legal monument.\n </p>\n</div>\n", "source": "https://anovademocracia.com.br/go-governador-inaugura-parque-em-homenagem-a-israel-e-faz-acordos-com-estado-sionista/", "type": "article", "title": "GO: Governor inaugurates Park in honor of Israel and makes agreements with Zionist state - the new democracy", "description": "Caiado inaugurated \"Am Israel Chai\" park on February 28.
