I think people can forget or not realize that \n When it comes to the Russians, you know, the Russians have also spent \n Significant amounts of ammunition in this war too. So, the \n Ask, in part - and that goes through drones and - where do they get help \n the Russians? And for those who want to focus or think we can \n focus (the United States can only focus on one theater at the same time, so \n that we should really focus on Taiwan, or even only Israel, or - and what \n We cannot do that, the reality when you look cooperation is that the Chinese \n They have provided significant help to the Russians. And it has been in all \n Areas, not in wholesale weapons systems. But a range of technology for \n Russian weapons systems that include everything from microchips for systems \n Weapons to pieces for ammunition.\n    <o:p>\n    </o:p>\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span>\n   <span>\n    The \n North Koreans have provided rockets and ammunition to the Russians.

There are also - it has also been \n Talking that Germans would provide taurus, for example, that it is a \n greater scope ammunition. what is your sense of where the Europeans are and \n How useful have they been when providing help to Ukraine? And then \n You know, if you can add something else.\n    <o:p>\n    </o:p>\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span>\n   <span>\n    We have \n Listened to many criticisms.

I don't think we can ignore its psychological dimension. I wanted to add, \n If I am allowed, two more things. One is American production. is \n Absolutely fundamental because we have the largest military industry and despite my previous scathing criticisms, \n We can expand things and get them on top. But it is also fundamental \n because we provide leadership and the type of central focus for this. These \n There are two - there are two types of industrial coalition competitors here. You \n One mentioned, Russia - Iran, China in the background with components and things, \n North Korea.\n    <o:p>\n    </o:p>\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span>\n   <span>\n    With us \n They are the Europeans, obviously, with the United States. But, you know, the Koreans \n Del Sur play a role and the Japanese play a role and states \n United is critical for that. So, if ... you know, and the South Koreans \n They sell 155 (- millimeters) so that we can then give ours \n Ukrainians; Indeed part of the game. We have to be in the center of \n that.\n    <o:p>\n    </o:p>\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span>\n   <span>\n    Now, I think \n That is important because ... I mean, I think the four are we tend to \n be quite critical, and properly, with our own government. In \n reality, Russians are found differently in a world of pain.\n    <o:p>\n    </o:p>\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span>\n   <span>\n    They are ... already \n You know, they are in a state of mobilization. It is not clear that\n    <o:p>\n    </o:p>\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span>\n   <span>\n    really \n They have been able to increase military production in a tremendously way \n significant. They still fight with the production of advanced parts. of team \n military. You know, for example, they have had this T-14 armata. tank they have \n State speaking for years. It is supposed to be incredible. system. Have had \n Problems to implement it. They have had trouble getting it to occur. \n Its fossil fuel income has been decreasing. Yes, the Chinese \n They buy that oil. The Chinese are good merchants. And then they understand \n that.

So you know, \n We should remind ourselves that if we, if the United States \n It is in the center, we propose it and keep the feet of our allies \n Europeans on fire, we can easily overcome these types both in quantity \n As in quality, safe, but I would say that even in quantitative terms. \n But there has to be a lot of political energy put in it. AND \n Unfortunately I don't see that.\n    <o:p>\n    </o:p>\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span>\n   <span>\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span>\n   <span>\n    Dr. Jones:\n    <o:p>\n    </o:p>\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span>\n   <span>\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span>\n   <span>\n    So, returning to its European point, yes, it is \n important to spend more on the Ministry of Defense. That 2 percent threshold \n In a certain sense, it simply highlights that. But at the end of the day, I think \n It is also important how they are spending their money. So, if we can achieve \n this. I'm going to go with Mike in a second with a question. But if we could show \n The image here. I just want the \n people see here. This is one of the Iranian drones, the Shahed. 136. This was \n Disabled in kyiv, and is now in possession of Ukrainians. You can also see \n Here it is an Iranian drone. And here this Iranian flag is on the side. \n So this gives us an idea of some of the other countries that have been \n providing assistance to the Russians.\n    <o:p>\n    </o:p>\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span>\n   <span>\n    What me \n Take, Mike, the Russians. That is, its Russian military evaluation. You already spoke a \n Little about this, but what do you have? Well done, in your sense? Where has you fought? \n And are we seeing some? Evolution of the Russian concept of operations? They used \n more air than had in the past in the offensive of Avdiivka. What does it mean \n that?\n    <o:p>\n    </o:p>\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span>\n   <span>\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span>\n   <span>\n    Honorable.\nVickers:\n    <o:p>\n    </o:p>\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span>\n   <span>\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span>\n   <span>\n    So, \n Where the Russians have done the best they can really be in this position of position \n where they have had an artillery advantage and an advantage. AND \n then those two things - and, in addition, the nine months, essentially, they were given \n To dig, prepare, put mined fields and other things that made the \n Ukrainian summer offensive last year was very problematic. That, and the \n lack of aerial power of the Ukrainians. You know, we essentially ask \n Ukrainians to fight a war in a way that the US army \n or the Western military would never do it. And you know, you just can't \n win that way. That is, it is military negligence.\n    <o:p>\n    </o:p>\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span>\n   <span>\n    So there \n It is where they have done better. They have done the worst they have been able to in the field \n Integrated combined weapons operations, airborne operations. AND \n This is something we have seen with the Russian army in the Russian-Georgian war. \n They thought they had plans to fix these things, you know, of the \n learned lessons. They have not really done a good job. And you know, if everything \n There seems to be worsened as the scale has increased. I mean, your \n Great advantage at this time is really in resources. And it may be \n more fragile than people think.\n    <o:p>\n    </o:p>\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span>\n   <span>\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span>\n   <span>\n    Dr. Jones:\n    <o:p>\n    </o:p>\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span>\n   <span>\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span>\n   <span>\n    Then yes \n We could open the slide, just to emphasize what Mike noticed. Can\n    <o:p>\n    </o:p>\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span>\n   <span>\n    Look at this \n It is ... this was last year. But we can see some of the Russian fighting of \n positions. The trenches that raised here, the dragon's teeth. These \n They are multiple rows of dragon teeth. You can't see it here because it is \n buried, but the mined fields, the anti -tanks that have used, the \n Mortar site and weapons locations they have had. They had \n time during last year's offensive to strengthen some of these \n defenses measures. What about Russian air?\n    <o:p>\n    </o:p>\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span>\n   <span>\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span>\n   <span>\n    Honorable.\nVickers:\n    <o:p>\n    </o:p>\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span>\n   <span>\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span>\n   <span>\n    Yes, the air \n Russian, you know, it has been based mainly on missiles and aerial vehicles \n Bened for strategic attack against populated centers. You know, and \n He certainly had some success in that. In terms of air power in the field of \n Battle, during the Ukrainian offensive they used attack helicopters reasonably \n Good to limit Ukrainian penetrations. Fixed wing airplanes have not \n done a lot. You know played a role in Avdiivka towards the end, when the \n Ukrainian army was withdrawing under pressure -\n    <o:p>\n    </o:p>\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span>\n   <span>\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span>\n   <span>\n    Dr. Jones:\n    <o:p>\n    </o:p>\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span>\n   <span>\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span>\n   <span>\n    And I didn't have many Earth-Aire missiles.\n    <o:p>\n    </o:p>\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span>\n   <span>\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span>\n   <span>\n    Honorable.\nVickers:\n    <o:p>\n    </o:p>\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span>\n   <span>\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span>\n   <span>\n    And had no earth-Aire missiles. But mainly \n He stayed behind the lines and plain pumps that can enter and \n achieve objectives. And then it has not been a great player. You know, the \n Russian doctrine integrates air with armies in the field, making the army \n superior. A little different from our approach.\n    <o:p>\n    </o:p>\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span>\n   <span>\n    Me too \n I would add that, you know, its operational advantages are\n    <o:p>\n    </o:p>\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span>\n   <span>\n    One thing. It \n that the Russians really tell to win the war is\n    <o:p>\n    </o:p>\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span>\n   <span>\n    essentially \n knocking out the allies of Ukraine. Basically cutting international support. \n You know, Eliot talked about this and Emily talked about political problems in the \n Congress.

What is the message that Russians want \n Let's absorb? that Ukraine cannot win, so we should withdraw the support. \n And that idea that this is going to be totally self -fulfilled, which once we accept \n The Russian policy of line then we go back, which makes it true, I think that \n It is what we have to protect at all costs.\n    <o:p>\n    </o:p>\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span>\n   <span>\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span>\n   <span>\n    Honorable.\nVickers:\n    <o:p>\n    </o:p>\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span>\n   <span>\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span>\n   <span>\n    I think that \n Lenin called them useful idiots.\n    <o:p>\n    </o:p>\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span>\n   <span>\n    Dr. Cohen:\n    <o:p>\n    </o:p>\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span>\n   <span>\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span>\n   <span>\n    Well, and in \n a way is already happening. I mean, even put Tucker aside \n Carlson, you know, you look at Senator Vance of Ohio. I mean, that's ... it's \n saying what Russians would like me to say. that there is no way that \n The Ukrainians can win, so we are realistic and stop helping them.\n    <o:p>\n    </o:p>\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span>\n   <span>\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span>\n   <span>\n    Dr. Jones:\n    <o:p>\n    </o:p>\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span>\n   <span>\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span>\n   <span>\n    Well, \n Emily, the Russians have also been active in many other areas. We have seen \n Navalny face death. We have seen a Ukrainian deserter probably \n Killed in Spain. What else do you have? I mean, what are you doing with what they are \n doing the Russians now in various fields?\n    <o:p>\n    </o:p>\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span>\n   <span>\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span>\n   <span>\n    Sra.\nHarding:\n    <o:p>\n    </o:p>\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span>\n   <span>\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span>\n   <span>\n    I mean, they get paid in a way that \n It seems quite surprising. What is clear: Navalny did not fall dead because \n own will in a Russian prison. I know in my bones as sure as \n I'm sitting here, and I didn't even have to do it. Be on the floor with him. \n We will discover it at some point in the future that was in fact killed, and it was \n Killed at a certain time for a certain reason. The fact that Putin \n It has allowed it just before Munich the conference is quite interesting. \n That came out almost at the same time that some news arose about some \n New Russian capabilities potentially being in space, I think it is very \n interesting.\n    <o:p>\n    </o:p>\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: 21.0pt; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;\">\n  <span>\n   <o:p>\n    <span>\n    </span>\n   </o:p>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: 21.0pt; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;\">\n  <span>\n   Transcription will continue ....\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: 21.0pt; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;\">\n  <span>\n   <o:p>\n    <span>\n    </span>\n   </o:p>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: 21.0pt; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;\">\n  <span>\n   \u200b\n   <o:p>\n   </o:p>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <o:p>\n  </o:p>\n </p>\n <b>\n  <span>\n  </span>\n </b>\n <p>\n </p>\n <div style=\"clear: both;\">\n </div>\n</div>\n", "description": "We publish two annexes, one is from a US newspaper and, the other, of a Yankee imperialism research center: 1.
