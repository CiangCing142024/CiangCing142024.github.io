The announcement \n of the production in Pomigliano della Panda is part of the maintenance program \n of the \"model that has been dominating the Italian market for several years\" for \n as regards the \"utility segment\" in Europe ... to implement this \n program, says Olivier, \u201cwe have in fact decided to\n  <b>\n   increase production \n 20%\n  </b>\n  To satisfy the demand for customers in Italy and Europe. \"\n  <o:p>\n  </o:p>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  But it must be said (always assuming that the choice to continue the \n production at least for another four years\n  <span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <a name=\"more\">\n </a>\n <span>\n </span>\n it is maintained) that this choice was\n <b>\n  facilitated\n </b>\n thanks to the postponement to infinity (\n <span>\n  or even the cancellation)\n </span>\n from the \n 2035 deadline, the year in which the production of \n current internal combustion engines.\n <o:p>\n </o:p>\n <p>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  This \"battle\" was made, so to say the least \n shameful, at European level by the representatives of the masters currently al \n Government in Italy (but also of France and Germany): a \"battle\" conducted in \n lobby style that has already produced its positive effects for the masters, \n because the European Union has in fact postponed any final decision on this \n argument, cheating on the \"climate effects\", which is why it was born \n The decision of the stop to 2035.\n  <o:p>\n  </o:p>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  While the masters and their representatives to the government \"work\" \n In tune, it is sure that the \"increase in production\" will continue to discharge certainly \n on the workers and workers of Pomigliano who cannot be found unprepared \n even in front of this attack.\n  <span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">\n  </span>\n  The answer \n It takes, a well -organized answer. In this sense we asked ourselves in one \n episode of counter -information \u201cwhen an effective meeting between the workers of \n Melfi, from Pomigliano, of Mirafiori to study the way of responding together \n to the government measures? Responding for forgiveness plant for forgiveness \n All plants. \"\n  <o:p>\n  </o:p>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  [https://proletaricomunisti.blogspot.com/2024/02/pc-3-febbraio-stellantis-la-difesa-del.html]\n </p>\n <div style=\"clear: both;\">\n </div>\n</div>\n", "description": "While for the workers and workers of the Pomigliano d'Arco factory the selective layoffs and the worsening of the C ...", "author": ["prolcompal"], "source": "https://proletaricomunisti.blogspot.com/2024/03/pc-1-marzo-stellantis-tra-licenziamenti.html"}
