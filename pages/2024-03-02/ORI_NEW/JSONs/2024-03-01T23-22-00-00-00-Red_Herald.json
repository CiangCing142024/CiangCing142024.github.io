As is usual, the old Brazilian State has mobilized a big number of troops, highly militarized, including armored military vehicles, military police and the infamous Special Operations Battalion (Bope), well-known for its uncountable crimes and massacres committed against the people. Also participating was the Actions with Dogs Battalion (BAC), which is also a special force belonging to the MP.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In addition to the murders carried out and the eviction of neighbors\u2019 houses that have been used as military posts by the repressive forces, there have been many other bad consequences for the inhabitants of the favelas: many schools have been closed, leaving more than 20.000 students without classes; businesses of the favela have been closed; additionally many family medical services have been closed, leaving thousands of people without medical care; even public transport has been suspended, leaving at least 130.000 people without buses.

As AND denounces, for years there have been mega-operations in the favelas and many massacres, which on many occasions have resulted in many murders. Another consequence of these criminal actions has been the protests and revolts of the people. AND reports that motorcycle taxi drivers in the Alem\u00e3o complex are planning a protest against the massacre, and also the climate of rebellion may spread to other favelas. So far this year there have also been protests previously in Mar\u00e9 and in Manguinhos.\n </p>\n <p>\n  These massacres have also been common in recent years and even the bourgeois press of the imperialist countries has reported on them,\n  <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/11/rio-deadliest-police-raid-favela-drugs-protest?emci=822974ee-52b2-eb11-85aa-0050f237abef&amp;emdi=903de8ee-53b2-eb11-85aa-0050f237abef&amp;ceid=4606001\">\n   for example after one of the largest massacres in Rio de Janeiro in 2021\n  </a>\n  , in which the attitude of the repressive forces unleashed the alarms, and that part of the bourgeois press took advantage of it to link this massacre with Bolsonaro to denounce it as something particular of his government.
