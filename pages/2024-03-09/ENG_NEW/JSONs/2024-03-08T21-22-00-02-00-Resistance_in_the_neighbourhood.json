And the meeting of this force \n -even incomplete and incomplete- with the struggle of workers and the \n Social rage on the road, on the big and important strike on the 28th of \n February, gave only a small sample of the possibilities produced \n From the co -options of struggling pieces, from the direction of \n Resistance and claim front!\n  <br/>\n  <br/>\n  It has been clear that the \n growning popular rage by miserable social status, accuracy, \n  expanding poverty and unemployment, the endless waves of anti -populist \n attack and their consequences on the terms of work, study, \n care and the very life of the masses, he will constantly give birth to \n Moods for struggle and race. That was what proved to be in the \n Last year's magnificent mobilizations after the crime of the system \n In Tempi, which was the fuse to break out the indignation that \n has accumulated \"underground\" for years. And as proved deafeningly by \n  Recent events, people and youth anything but willing \n  is to forget and give forgiveness to the real \n perpetrators of crime. This is true, even if their rage \n for the time being diverted to millions of online signatures for the \n 'Removal of immunity' and 'constitutional review', which, which \n Regardless of the intentions of the participants, they only manage to \n disorientate and obscure the path of fight against \n Responsible for countless crimes at the expense of life of life \n exploitation and its policies. At the same time, in the direction of \n Full concealment seems to be moving the parliamentary process of \n  Inquiry Committee, which recently appeared as a great deal \n Success from the KKE, which had given the current in favor of his fight \n to adopt as a proposal by the bourgeois parties, since \n He had previously taken care of the Sporting meeting to preach the end \n  of mobilizations on the subject, in view of the 'Mother of Battles', of \n parliamentary elections that were then approaching.\n  <br/>\n  <br/>\n  As long as they are not recorded, \n Well, real steps of forming, integrating, upgrading the \n struggle, so much system forces will use the negative \n Class-political correlation to promote their attack. The truth \n This is what is reflected in the determination of the ND government \n to proceed with the Pierrakakis bill on private universities, to \n Do not retreat from the \"Sacred and Sacred\" of \"Fiscal Stability\" \n in front of agricultural claims, while the fields were flooded again with \n A few rains and compensation and projects announced here \n and months are referred to the calendars, to continue opening unknown \n a series of fronts, as with the recent joint ministerial decision to \n the operation of afternoon surgeries in hospitals and \n Further commercialization of the social good of health.\n  <br/>\n  <br/>\n  THE \n Ability, of course, of the government to implement its anti -popular agenda \n in all areas, as well as the support he still enjoys from the \n Basic centers of power inside and outside the country, anything other than \n They also signal some of her ability to persuade wide folk \n mattresses in order to accept its policy. Therefore \n Government, but also the \"whole system\" are constantly taking care of reminding \n that the attack will pass \"by fire and iron\", with ever \n greater intensity of fascisting of public and political life, \n by persecution of fighters, with drag unions in the courts, with the \n Class unionism in illegality by Hatzidakis-Georgiadis laws, \n by terrorism and targeting the youth struggling, with the \n Mitsotakis even reach statements about the need to make them \n changes to disciplinary regulations of HEIs, so as to open the \n Road to deletion of students involved in occupations.\n  <br/>\n  <a href=\"https://www.kkeml.gr/ps958/ergazomenoi-agrotes-foithtes-na-synexisoun-thn-palh-tous/\" target=\"_blank\">\n   follow up here\n  </a>\n </div>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   <b>\n    Read on sheet 958 released on Saturday 9 March 2024\n   </b>\n  </i>\n  <br/>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <b>\n   Sheet contents\n   <a href=\"https://www.kkeml.gr/ps958/\" target=\"_blank\">\n    here\n   </a>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n   Main articles\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n  </b>\n  <b>\n   <a href=\"https://www.kkeml.gr/ps958/ergazomenoi-agrotes-foithtes-na-synexisoun-thn-palh-tous/\" target=\"_blank\">\n    The river is not turning back!\n    <br/>\n    Workers - Farmers - Students to continue their struggle!\n   </a>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n  </b>\n  <b>\n   <a href=\"https://www.kkeml.gr/ps958/katw-oi-dolofonoi-siwnazoi-kai-to-varvaro-kratos-tous-fulakio-twn-hpa/\" target=\"_blank\">\n    Palestine on the bloody ropes of slaughter and famine!\n    <br/>\n    Below are the Zionists and their barbaric state, USA!\n   </a>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n  </b>\n  <b>\n   <a href=\"https://www.kkeml.gr/ps958/oi-enoxoi-koukoulwnoun-to-egklhma-sta-temph/\" target=\"_blank\">\n    The culprits are hunting the crime in Tempi\n    <br/>\n    Let us not allow them!\n   </a>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n  </b>\n  <b>\n   <a href=\"https://www.kkeml.gr/ps958/oi-ygeionomikoi-kai-olos-o-laos-prepei-na-paleuoume-gia-ta-dikaiwmata-mas-oxi-gia-reformistikes-autapates/\" target=\"_blank\">\n    The health and all the people must fight for our rights, not for reformist illusions!\n   </a>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n  </b>\n  <b>\n   <a href=\"https://www.kkeml.gr/ps958/nikh-ston-dikaio-agwna-twn-ergazomenwn-sta-thlefwnika-kentra/\" target=\"_blank\">\n    Interview with TELEPERFORMANCE strikers\n    <br/>\n    Victory in the fair fight of the call centers workers!\n   </a>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n  </b>\n  <b>\n   <a href=\"https://www.kkeml.gr/ps958/pasok-suriza-sthrizoun-th-dhmiourgia-idiwtikwn-panepisthmiwn-kai-paristanoun-thn-antipoliteush/\" target=\"_blank\">\n    PASOK and SYRIZA support the creation of private universities and represent the \"opposition\"\n   </a>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n  </b>\n  <b>\n   <a href=\"https://www.kkeml.gr/ps958/h-syndiaskepsh-ths-neas-aristeras-kai-h-epistrofh-ths-arxaias-skourias/\" target=\"_blank\">\n    The Conference of the \"New Left\" and the return of \"Ancient Rust\"\n   </a>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n  </b>\n  <b>\n   <a href=\"https://www.kkeml.gr/ps958/kati-san-synedrio-me-entono-systhmiko-deksio-apotypwma/\" target=\"_blank\">\n    SYRIZA\n    <br/>\n    Something like a conference with a strong systemic - right footprint\n   </a>\n  </b>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <b>\n   <a href=\"https://www.kkeml.gr/ps958/oi-mazikes-apergiakes-kinhtopoihseis-stis-28-flevarh-anadeiknuoun-dunatothtes-kai-kathhkonta/\" target=\"_blank\">\n    Mass strike mobilizations on 28 February highlight capabilities and duties\n    <br/>\n    Ultimately need to highlight the labor claims and to set up matches\n   </a>\n  </b>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <b>\n   CENTRAL SALE POINTS\n  </b>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <b>\n   ATHENA\n  </b>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <span style=\"white-space: normal;\">\n   <span style=\"white-space: pre;\">\n   </span>\n   Bookstore\n   <a href=\"https://ektostonteixon.gr/\" target=\"_blank\">\n    Outside the walls\n   </a>\n   Gravias 10-12 Exarchia\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <span style=\"white-space: normal;\">\n   <span style=\"white-space: pre;\">\n   </span>\n   Hangout opposite Miltiadou 3 Daphne\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <b>\n   Thessaloniki\n  </b>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <span style=\"white-space: normal;\">\n   <span style=\"white-space: pre;\">\n   </span>\n   <a href=\"http://steki-sfentona.blogspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\n    Slingen youth and culture space\n   </a>\n   , Syngrou 24, 2nd floor\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <b>\n   YANNENA\n  </b>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <span style=\"white-space: normal;\">\n   <span style=\"white-space: pre;\">\n   </span>\n   Left Kougiou Youth Hang 23\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <b>\n   blonde\n  </b>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <span style=\"white-space: normal;\">\n   <span style=\"white-space: pre;\">\n   </span>\n   <a href=\"https://rogmixanthi.blogspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\n    Crack left space of thought and action\n   </a>\n   , M.
