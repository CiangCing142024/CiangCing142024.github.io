   gathered

  at the square of the Kadıköy district of Istanbul, and marched through 
the streets under the slogan “Struggle Against Poverty, Violence, 
Exploitation and War”. Several women’s organizations took part in the 
march, including the YDK. Slogans such as “The 8

 <p>
  Demands were raised for the release of recently imprisoned political 
prisoners, including Partizan reader Arzu Aksakal, with the slogan “Let 
the dungeons be destroyed, freedom for the prisoners”. The crimes of the
 government in regards to the 2023 earthquake were denounced frequently.
 Photographs of women murdered or disappeared in the earthquake as well 
as women murdered as a result of patriarchal violence were carried. The 
struggle of women in the workplace and universities were also raised, as
 well as solidarity with those suffering from war and occupation around 
the world, and support of the struggle of the Saturday Mothers who have 
been demanding to learn the fate of those who have disappeared in 
custody of the old Turkish State.

  We also share an unofficial translation of a statement by the YDK:
 </p>
 <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">
  The burden of the world on our shoulders, the weaving workers in our memory, the struggle for freedom in our consciousness…
 </h2>
 <p class="has-text-align-center">
  On the 8th of March 1857, 40,000 women 
weavers went on strike in New York, USA, demanding “equal pay for equal 
work”. In the fire that broke out during this strike, 129 women workers 
who were locked in the factory lost their lives.
  <span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <a name="more">
 </a>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p class="has-text-align-center">
  The 1850s were years when labor 
movements were on the rise in the USA. Industrial workers were working 
under extraordinarily difficult conditions. Women led the working class 
of the period and went on strike to demand a reduction of the 16-hour 
workday to 10 hours, correction of inhumane working conditions, an 
increase in wages, and equal rights for women workers.
 </p>
 <p class="has-text-align-center">
  After this event, at the meeting of the
 women of the 2nd International (International Socialist Women’s 
Conference) in Copenhagen, Denmark, Clara Zetkin and Rosa Luxemburg, 
leaders of the Social Democratic Party of Germany, proposed that the 8th
 of March should be International Women’s Day and the proposal was 
accepted.
 </p>
 <p class="has-text-align-center">
  Since then, women have been fighting for the demands put forward by the murdered weavers.
 </p>
 <p class="has-text-align-center">
  Women continued to be inspired by this 
history of resistance and took to the streets every 8th of March, 
despite all the pressure, difficult conditions and bans. All over the 
world, women have struggled and continue to struggle for their 
invisible, ignored and underpaid labor. As in other countries, women in 
Turkey, Kurdistan and the Middle East are taking to the streets and 
shouting their demands on the streets.
 </p>
 <p class="has-text-align-center">
  Today, women are being condemned to 
more poverty, which has been exposed by the deepening economic crisis on
 a global scale, and are being slaughtered by the wars going on around 
the world. The roads of migration become the roads of death for women. 
If they are not on the road, they are subjected to attacks such as 
harassment and rape in addition to poverty where they stay, and they are
 killed in their homes, workplaces and streets as a result of male 
violence.
 </p>
 <p class="has-text-align-center">
  Today, the fascist AKP-MHP bloc, the 
representative of the patriarchal State, constantly attacks women’s 
vested rights. These attacks have become even more reckless after the 
annulment of the Istanbul Convention, which was signed with the rising 
wave of women’s struggle and rebellion. Women who struggle for their 
rights and gains are also subjected to all kinds of violence by the 
patriarchal State.
 </p>
 <p class="has-text-align-center">
  In this geography, as in Palestine and 
Rojava, poor peoples, mostly women and LGBTI+s, are massacred in the 
wars waged by the imperialist-capitalist system in search of markets.
 </p>
 <p class="has-text-align-center">
  On the other hand, the blatant massacre
 of workers and nature in Erzincan İliç by the patriarchal State and its
 representatives AKP-MHP will cause serious problems in the region in 
the coming years. This massacre will place a new and heavy workload on 
the shoulders of women. Already today, women are worried about their 
future in the region, wondering what they can do for a healthier future 
for their children.
 </p>
 <p class="has-text-align-center">
  We saw a similar situation when the 6th
 of February Maraş earthquake turned into a massacre of hundreds of 
thousands of people. Women were forced to shoulder very heavy burdens 
for the survival of those left behind and are still trying to survive in
 the earthquake zone by shouldering burdens that are getting 
exponentially heavier.
 </p>
 <p class="has-text-align-center">
  In the wars caused by the sovereigns, 
the burden of the poor peoples, the burden of the massacre of nature and
 all living things through ecological massacres, the burden of the 
massacre of people, nature and living things in the region through the 
earthquake, and the burden of the poverty caused by the economic crisis 
are also placed on the shoulders of women. Just as their labor at home 
is ignored, the worth of the labor they create in workplaces and 
factories is decreasing day by day.
 </p>
 <p class="has-text-align-center">
  Despite all the countless burdens, 
women stubbornly and persistently do not give up their struggle all over
 the world. We women, with the burden of the world on our shoulders, 
with the weaving workers in our memory, persistently continue the 
struggle for freedom that we inherited and engraved in our consciousness
 despite all wars, massacres and attacks. We are in every moment of life
 and struggle, as in the resistance of Palestinian women, as in the 
resistance of Rojavan women against the war waged by the 
imperialist-capitalists and their lackey the Turkish State using all 
kinds of technology, as in the resistance of women who have been 
shouldering the invisible but increasing burden since the 6th of 
February, as in the resistance of women at Agrobay, Özak, Sputnik, Burda
 Bebek and in countless factories who claim their labor, which is 
ignored and seen as cheap labor, as in the resistance of women. We are 
also present in the struggle for survival against the violence, 
harassment and rape they are subjected to at home with the argument of 
the patriarchal State’s “sacred family”, and in the effort to organize 
in universities despite all oppression and attacks. We are also the ones
 who put a stop to the patriarchal State that hatefully tries to make 
our lives dependent on cotton threads with elevator massacres. We are 
the women and LGBTI+”s who do not withdraw from workplaces, workplaces, 
streets and action areas despite all attacks and ignoring. We will be on
 the streets this 8th of March as we are every 8th of March. We continue
 our march for freedom this 8th of March as well. We call on all women 
to take action on the streets to enlarge this march.
 </p>
 <p class="has-text-align-center">
  Long live 8th of March, long live women’s solidarity!
 </p>
 <p class="has-text-align-center">
  New democratic woman
