  THE 
  Power of the Mass Struggle of Farmers and Student Youth has 
  undoubtedly puts its stamp on political and social 
 Developments of the last two months. And the meeting of this force 
 -even incomplete and incomplete- with the struggle of workers and the 
 Social rage on the road, on the big and important strike on the 28th of 
 February, gave only a small sample of the possibilities produced 
 From the co -options of struggling pieces, from the direction of 
 Resistance and claim front!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It has been clear that the 
 growning popular rage by miserable social status, accuracy, 
  expanding poverty and unemployment, the endless waves of anti -populist 
 attack and their consequences on the terms of work, study, 
 care and the very life of the masses, he will constantly give birth to 
 Moods for struggle and race. That was what proved to be in the 
 Last year's magnificent mobilizations after the crime of the system 
 In Tempi, which was the fuse to break out the indignation that 
 has accumulated "underground" for years. And as proved deafeningly by 
  Recent events, people and youth anything but willing 
  is to forget and give forgiveness to the real 
 perpetrators of crime. This is true, even if their rage 
 for the time being diverted to millions of online signatures for the 
 'Removal of immunity' and 'constitutional review', which, which 
 Regardless of the intentions of the participants, they only manage to 
 disorientate and obscure the path of fight against 
 Responsible for countless crimes at the expense of life of life 
 exploitation and its policies. At the same time, in the direction of 
 Full concealment seems to be moving the parliamentary process of 
  Inquiry Committee, which recently appeared as a great deal 
 Success from the KKE, which had given the current in favor of his fight 
 to adopt as a proposal by the bourgeois parties, since 
 He had previously taken care of the Sporting meeting to preach the end 
  of mobilizations on the subject, in view of the 'Mother of Battles', of 
 parliamentary elections that were then approaching.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As long as they are not recorded, 
 Well, real steps of forming, integrating, upgrading the 
 struggle, so much system forces will use the negative 
 Class-political correlation to promote their attack. The truth 
 This is what is reflected in the determination of the ND government 
 to proceed with the Pierrakakis bill on private universities, to 
 Do not retreat from the "Sacred and Sacred" of "Fiscal Stability" 
 in front of agricultural claims, while the fields were flooded again with 
 A few rains and compensation and projects announced here 
 and months are referred to the calendars, to continue opening unknown 
 a series of fronts, as with the recent joint ministerial decision to 
 the operation of afternoon surgeries in hospitals and 
 Further commercialization of the social good of health.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  THE 
 Ability, of course, of the government to implement its anti -popular agenda 
 in all areas, as well as the support he still enjoys from the 
 Basic centers of power inside and outside the country, anything other than 
 They also signal some of her ability to persuade wide folk 
 mattresses in order to accept its policy. Therefore 
 Government, but also the "whole system" are constantly taking care of reminding 
 that the attack will pass "by fire and iron", with ever 
 greater intensity of fascisting of public and political life, 
 by persecution of fighters, with drag unions in the courts, with the 
 Class unionism in illegality by Hatzidakis-Georgiadis laws, 
 by terrorism and targeting the youth struggling, with the 
 Mitsotakis even reach statements about the need to make them 
 changes to disciplinary regulations of HEIs, so as to open the 
 Road to deletion of students involved in occupations.
