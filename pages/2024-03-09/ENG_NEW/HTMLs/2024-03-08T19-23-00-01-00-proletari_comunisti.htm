 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  March 8 already started since this night, from the factories, from 
 workers, often immigrants, who have already responded with force and with 
 The strike that today, in the various shifts, will be in some factories.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  March 8 is 
 continuing in the various cities, first of all with the role of 
 workers who, as well as strike, are making principals and 
 also collecting all the women who say enough, that yes 
 rebel.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The same the 
 students this morning in some large cities such as Milan, Rome, 
 etc ... are fighting together with the school workers. So the 
 precarious of social cooperatives that constantly risk not 
 have the work more, with very low wages, in many cities too 
 This morning they are making principals against the institutions 
 responsible in general first of all of this condition of 
 precariousness.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Then there will be 
 Other events, other processions in the afternoon.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  It's a day 
 ours, is a day of women who rebel, it's a day 
 of women who want to unleash their fury for a change 
 total, a revolution that is a "revolution - as we say- 
 earth to heaven "
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The strike of 
 women, the mobilizations, many, various, who are keeping today, yes 
 they articulate around two appeals around in particular: the appeal that 
 it concerns all the various realities of the various cities, which is 
 the appeal of not one of less than, after the great demonstration of the 
 November 25 in Rome, brought to this other day with an appeal 
 that we largely share and of which we will then read some pieces.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The other appeal is 
 Ours is the appeal of the proletarian feminist movement 
 Revolutionary that unites with the concrete action, in 
 Particularly towards factories and workers, workers with Palestinian women.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Let's read precisely 
 Some pieces of these appeals.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  In the appeal of not one less, women are said to have the responsibility of 
 stop the black wave that takes more racist, more individualist, 
 poorer with fewer rights. At the same time it says that the power 
 on November 25th wants to pour into this March 8 with the blockade 
 of production and reproduction, and in asking the government how much 
 The lives of all those subjectivity are valid that do not fall within the 
 Dio/Patria/Family Project.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  And therefore in 
 This appeal, rightly, is attacked the whole Meloni government 
 that treats feminicides, male violence, as a problem 
 securitarian and therefore shows how the rise of the rights in the world 
 has made feminist, racist policies even more hard, 
 nationalists who feed exploitation and violence. So then it does 
 A summary of the condition of the majority of women: women 
 they have lower wages, more precarious jobs, hunger pensions, 
 suffer the cuts and school cuts more, which fall 
 doubly on them and on the care of the care work.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  One of the words 
 of order, slogan, that the appeal of not one of less carries on, are 
 On the one hand, the strike of 8 March against patriarchal violence 
 And on the other "if our lives, our work do not apply, we 
 Let's strike ".
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  We think that 
 this year by not one less there is a more position 
 Chiara, of struggle against the government that carries on the position above all of working women.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  In our 
 appeal we say that workers indomitable, 
 Despite attacks, blackmailing at work, threats, climate 
 increasingly heavy, discriminatory on the jobs 
 Also this year they did not stop, they continued to 
 fight by saying “Nobody can crush us, nobody can attack 
 Our dignity and for this we strike ".
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  So I'm in 
 Primis the workers who take a fight in their hands because 
 All life must change.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  In the appeal 
 It is written:
  <i>
   “The Meloni government gives everything to the masters e 
 Chat, alms for working women. Meloni replies to 
 feminicides, rapes, which are increasing with more police in the 
 neighborhoods, securitarian decrees, while its squalids, hateful 
 Ministers, they offend women. This government wants to take away every 
 right, first of all the right of abortion, because we should 
 serve only to make more children to give fresh meat to be exploited to 
 masters and for the homeland, for the wars, thus leaning us too 
 All the family care work, while healthy worsens.
  </i>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  <i>
   A government 
 racist who gives suffering and death to our immigrant sisters. A 
 government that wants to educate even children in schools to do the 
 war, inculcating an outdated nationalist humus. This is 
 fascist! And this fascism of the Meloni government feeds a modern 
 patriarchalism of hateful males who react by killing, increasing 
 more and more, in a truly horrible way, the feminicides, killing 
 When women don't want to be submissive, they want to break the 
 oppressive ties.
  </i>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  <i>
   And then just 
 The workers who are together include the weapon of struggle 
 of unity, which there are no individual private conditions but 
 social, class, the result of this capitalist society, the 
 workers must take a collective struggle in hand not only for 
 defend themselves from the attacks of masters and government, but to change all 
 their life, the life of the majority of women, to change 
 this world.
  </i>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  <i>
   Because of this 
 Let's tell workers, workers, be bold, proud, more 
 determined on everything. If we women do it, if we become 
 "Dangerous", the government force/masters/state can be 
 cracked and then…. Then…. overturned with the proletarian revolution 
 of all exploited and oppressed, in which women, for theirs 
 condition, suffer not an oppression, but oppression 
 Certainly, a total oppression and bring an extra gear.
  </i>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But in this 8 
 March, together with the centrality of the women's strike, of the 
 condition, of the struggles of the workers and workers, the other aspect 
 The solidarity with Palestinian women is central.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  In the appeal of 
 Not one less this is placed as an important aspect, the 
 Palestinian flag has been present since the convocation flyer. 
 In the appeal it is said:
  <i>
   “War, genocide and colonialism 
 They are the maximum expression of the patriarchal system. And us 
 We deploy alongside the Palestinian women who fight for 
 one's existence and self -determination. And we claim the immediate 
 cease fire on Gaza. With Palestine in the heart "
  </i>
  .
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  In the initiatives that we have already from this night 
 made towards the factories, to the workers and in all places of 
 work, the appeal to solidarity by workers to women was central 
 Palestinians.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  In our 
 Appeal we say that on this March 8th
  <i>
   “It goes all of ours 
 solidarity with Palestinian women massacred, hungry in dozens of 
 thousands, who see their children killed by bombs and hunger, 
 thirst, lack of medicines, women who cannot give birth in 
 Bombarded hospitals, which abort on the street. But they are also women 
 which transform their immense pain into force, in resistance. AND 
 So we give unconditional support to Palestinian women, 
 to the resistance of the Palestinian people, against criminal action 
 Genocidia of Israel, against the wars that imperialist states, 
 including Italian imperialism, they are carrying out many 
 parts of the world.
  </i>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  <i>
   And let's say too 
 that there is a link between us and the Palestinian women, this link must 
 become more concrete and stronger. And the Meloni government, the owners of the 
 our country that build weapons, which support support for 
 Genocidia Netanyahu, these are equally accomplices and responsible 
 of the massacres in Palestine. These monsters not only use ours 
 lives for their profits, their reactionary, racist plans, 
 repressive to prevent the freedom of us women, but want 
 crushing the Palestinian people.
  </i>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  <i>
   For this the 
 Palestinian women's struggle is our struggle.
  </i>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  So I live an 8 
 Proletarian and internationalist March, even more this year 
 Proletarian and internationalist!
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  On this March 8th 
 We have some less companions who left us. But these 
 companions in March 8 live in all our struggles and in March 8 
 they will also be side by side in the initiatives, in the 
 events.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  In particular 
 We want to remember three companions.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The partner of 
 Taranto, Concetta Musio, the partner who has always been active, 
 also stimulating in ideas, in proposals, in the feminist movement 
 Revolutionary proletarian, always present in the struggles, in 
 Slai Cobas initiatives for the class union. This 
 companion left us on February 20, his last presence - was 
 sick for some time, but as soon as he could come to the events 
 -It was for Palestine in November, in a 
 garrison in Taranto. But we believe that the right way to 
 Remember it both through his words. Right on the occasion of an 8 
 March she wrote:
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  “
  <i>
   It's our turn 
 feminists, workers, unemployed, migrants, fighting and being 
 The avant -garde of the women's liberation movement. The 
 discrimination have not been swept away, especially in the world 
 of work where women remain an oppressed majority, with 
 disparity, injustices, harassment and violence both in the places of 
 work that in the home. We know well that the road is in 
 climb, but determined as we are, combatives as we are,

   steep. And therefore the day of March March 
 It must not be an end in itself. We need to do 
 more, to make strong actions that make ours truly feel 
 voice and who give a truly revolutionary turning point. "
  </i>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  And the precisely the 
 Revolution, certainty and trust in the possibility, necessity, 
 of the Revolution that Concetta always carried in its activities with 
 companions and companions with whom he fought.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The other partner 
 who unfortunately died, who left us a short time ago, is the 
 companion Anna of Amazora. Here we also read a text that his 
 Bologna companions sent us for this March 8th.
  <i>
   “Care 
 Compares, after the death of our partner Anna, we get up. In 
 This March 8 we reiterate our unconditional solidarity at 
 women and the resistance of the Palestinian people who fight against him 
 Israeli Assassin State. Those persecuted of yesterday who are 
 transformed into persecutors, who have tried to carry on the '48 
 ethnic police, occupying militarily, devastating, torturing, 
 Unging and killing the Palestinians. We are alongside that 
 People who despite all this, do not break and do not give up. 
 Against the state of all latitudes, with its borders and galleys 
 which keep this system standing that sows death and misery. 
 With Anna in the heart, Palestine free from the river to death.
  </i>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Finally he has us 
 Leaving a third partner, the Rosa partner of Milan. Rose 
 Calderazzi was from Taranto, he loved his land very much and often there 
 He came back, but it's in Milan that she became an active partner 
 militant. Since 1968, from the great season of '68, he began the 
 his struggle both as a woman and as a worker and as a militant. 
 His struggle in '68 was certainly the most fruitful period 
 because it was full of the need for the revolution, beyond the 
 organizational choices, political, made, but what moved it was the 
 Fight for the revolution. Then the Rosa partner in Milan gave the 
 its contribution in many other mobilizations, in many others 
 Associations. In particular, in recent years he was very active in 
 Not one less and in the women's house in Milan. But in the same 
 time, in her freedom, she did much more, she turned the world 
 To know, to understand and therefore reported this world, the 
 world of people first of all, through photographs, in 
 Italy. She liked dancing, she liked to live. For this to the greeting 
 that we have given this partner on March 2 in Milan, at the cemetery 
 of Lambrate, about 150 people came, especially women, e 
 each brought an aspect of what this partner was and 
 So together, putting together all aspects, it came out 
 a partner, a figure who unfortunately left us, but that too 
 It will remain with us and on this March 8th it will also parade with us.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  March 8 is one 
 International/Internationalist day, in which all women of 
 Every country from all over the world fight.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  We want today 
 In particular, highlight the struggle that carry on their companions 
 Indian, Indian women with the War of Popolo. There is from them 
 received an appeal, a press release, also aimed at all women 
 who are struggling today, which descend into the squares. Is a press release 
 of the organization of women Adivasi Bastar. Of this hour 
 We read some excerpts. This press release is entitled “We fight 
 To bury patriarchate, for female emancipation ". 
 We report some parts.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  “
  <i>
   Now we are 
 Under the game of two monstrous terrors: the Bramanico patriarchy is 
 A peculiar Indian room of the horrors in a company 
 semi -colonial and semi -feudal where women are forced to live in 
 This horror room. Women face multitudes of 
 economic and extra -economic exploitation that remains unpunished and the 
 male domination acts as a barrier to the general view of the 
 society… .. in a socially and economically backward country 
 Like India, women of the working class, peasants, women 
 of the castes, of the oppressed communities are the most exploited of the 
 society. Economic and social exploitation remains an integral part 
 For women in India. This exploitation of women comes 
 perpetrated on the pretext of democracy and emancipation 
 of women. But women are visible in every struggle, both in 
 Aganwaty, both in Kachemire, in the manipur against the violence of the 
 terrorist forces induced supported by the Indian state, both women 
 tribals that are fighting against corporateization and the 
 militarization in the forest areas of central India. In 
 peasant protests, in the fight against fascism induct, in the 
 Fight against imperialism, women are everyone's core 
 These movements. These are all class struggles and without struggles of 
 class against feudalism, the bureaucratic bourgeoisie, tablet e 
 Imperialism, there cannot be female emancipation. In 
 last four decades, the women of Dandakryana have fought against 
 The theft and looting of natural resources by classes 
 of the masters. The Dominant Indian classes, with the support of the masters 
 imperialists, have deployed thousands of military forces in the 
 Jungle, together with tanks, military drones, helicopters and others 
 war mechanisms. But women are breaking the chains of the 
 Patriarchate with new democratic cultural practices. The movement 
 of the women of Dandakryana are creating a new chapter in the 
 revolutionary history. "
