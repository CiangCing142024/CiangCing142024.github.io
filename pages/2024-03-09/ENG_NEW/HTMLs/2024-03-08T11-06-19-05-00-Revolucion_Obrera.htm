  <p>
   Today, when the woman's situation goes through a strong moment, the biography of the distingu I design more against female sex, making this society a hell for women; Punishing them with the scourge of the superxploitation, discrimination, war, forced displacement, rape, feminicide and as if that were not enough, their revictimization in judgments and impunity.
  </p>
  <p>
   We have based on this brochure the work done by
   <em>
    Ave Phoenix editions
   </em>
   In 2013 and published as
   <em>

   </em>
   . For this edition, we keep the title for being very appropriate, we suppress the parties «
   <em>
    Displaced women
   </em>
   » y «
   <em>
    Afro -descendant women
   </em>
   »And we expand it instead with the inclusion of other biographies of prominent women in the fight; Finally, some small spelling and style corrections were made.

   These women had a great breastplate to erect on their shoulders part of the class struggle of the proletariat, making not only the unity for fighting with the men of our class, but also advancing in their own liberation. As avant -garde women, they refused to follow the guidance of the bourgeoisie .
  </p>
  <p>
   How many conquests, how much revolutionary work for advancing in the defeat of our common enemy there is in the history of these heroines of the proletariat and of all women, huge leaders who came to understand not only that men and women must fight as one, but also that The struggle for the liberation of women (including those belonging to the bourgeoisie and the little bourgeoisie), is permanent even after the conquest of political power by the proletariat.
